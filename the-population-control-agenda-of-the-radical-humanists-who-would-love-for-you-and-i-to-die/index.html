<p>Michael Snyder, <i>Contributor</i><br />
<a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2012/10/the-population-control-agenda-of.html"><b>Activist Post</b></a></p>
<p>Billions of dollars is being poured into an effort to reduce  population growth all over the world, and most people do not even know  that it is happening.  These efforts are often promoted under such  labels as “family planning”, “abortion rights” and “public health  programs”, but the primary goal is always to get women to have less  children.</p>
<p>This population control agenda has millions upon millions of  supporters all over the planet and it is gaining even more adherents  with each passing day.  It is being taught in colleges, universities and  schools all over the globe.  It is being promoted by radical humanists  who are completely and totally convinced that the core crisis that  humanity is facing today is that there are way too many people living on  this planet.  They fully believe that overpopulation is the root cause  of most of our economic, social, political and environmental problems.   In fact, the truth is that many of them actually believe that they are  literally in a “life or death” race to save the planet.</p>
<p>Many of the  “true believers” are entirely convinced that if human population numbers  are not greatly reduced from where they are now, the planet we are  living on will be completely destroyed.  That is why many of these  radical humanists would absolutely love for you and I to die.  From  their perspective, the less people the better.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>Many who write about the population control agenda make it sound as  if there is just a “tiny elite” that is promoting this philosophy.   Sadly, that is simply not accurate.  The truth is that this twisted  agenda is being taught at the majority of the colleges and universities  in the United States.  It is being promoted in our television shows and  in our movies.  It is even being taught to elementary school children.</p>
<p>As a result, more Americans than ever are embracing this philosophy.   You would be surprised how many people actually believe that our  growing population will soon cause major shortages of food, water, oil  and other important resources.</p>

<p>
For example, the following is an excerpt from one comment that was  left on one of my previous articles about population control….</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is undeniable, the earth is being completely  destroyed and while the planet could theoretically sustain probably  between 13 to 16 billion people, this would require 2 developments to  occur: </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>1. There would have to be a global resource-rational production  &amp; distribution scheme which would ensure that each person could have  enough air, water &amp; food, in an environment where, due to the  resulting scarcity on clean resources, excess &amp; hoarding would be  directly correlated with human death. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>2. There would have to be a dramatic reduction in the quality of  life for a dramatically higher percentage of the world’s population than  currently experience miserable lives.<br />
Rather than accept these awful outcomes of unfettered  industrialization, let us instead embark on a course to drastically  limit the global population to around 500 million.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Does that figure sound familiar?</p>
<p>It should.  That is the exact target number for the global human population that we find <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Guidestones" target="_blank" title="on the Georgia Guidestones">on the Georgia Guidestones</a>.</p>
<p>But when the population of the earth was back at 500 million did we still have poverty, war, famines and other similar problems?</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/familysurvival.html" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 0em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-wNo87rwTkak/T_Nf058z13I/AAAAAAAAQUg/zfQlS8HQtiw/s270/150x270.gif"></a>Of course we did.</p>
<p>Reducing the population of the planet by more than 90 percent would not wipe out any of our problems.</p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>But this sick agenda is being endlessly promoted in the mainstream  media.  For example, during a recent radio interview HBO personality  Bill Maher stated that he is “consistently pro-death” and that he wants  society to find ways to get more people to die off….</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m pro-choice, I’m for assisted suicide, I’m for  regular suicide, I’m for whatever gets the freeway moving – that’s what  I’m for. It’s too crowded, the planet is too crowded and we need to  promote death.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can hear Maher making these comments <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqMSPooXJIk&amp;feature=player_embedded" target="_blank" title="right here">right here</a>.</p>
<p>If you think that is sick, just check out this next example.</p>
<p>Two “scientists” recently published a paper <a href="http://jme.bmj.com/content/early/2012/03/01/medethics-2011-100411.full" target="_blank" title="in the Journal of Medical Ethics">in the Journal of Medical Ethics</a>  in which they called for the legalization of the murder of newborn  babies.  Instead of “murder”, they want it to be called “after-birth  abortion” ….</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[W]hen circumstances occur after birth such that  they would have justified abortion, what we call after-birth abortion  should be permissible. … [W]e propose to call this practice ‘after-birth  abortion’, rather than ‘infanticide,’ to emphasize that the moral  status of the individual killed is comparable with that of a fetus …  rather than to that of a child. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Therefore, we claim that killing a newborn could be ethically  permissible in all the circumstances where abortion would be. Such  circumstances include cases where the newborn has the potential to have  an (at least) acceptable life, but the well-being of the family is at  risk.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Isn’t that disturbing?</p>
<p>Actually, you would probably be surprised at how many people there  are that will read this article and find nothing wrong with the idea of  “after-birth abortion”.</p>
<p>Respect for life is rapidly declining in our society, and a big  reason for that is because the population control agenda is being pushed  at our colleges and universities.</p>
<p>Just check out this quote from an actual <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/biology/7-014-introductory-biology-spring-2005/video-lectures/30-population-growth-ii/" target="_blank" title="classroom lecture">classroom lecture</a> by MIT professor Penny Chisholm….</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The real trick is, in terms of trying to level off  at someplace lower than that 9 billion, is to get the birthrates in the  developing countries to drop as fast as we can. And that will determine  the level at which humans will level off on earth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is something deeply insidious about specifically targeting the  “developing countries” for population control.  Do you think that  Professor Chisholm really understands the full implications of what she  is saying?<br />
<a href="http://activistpost.net/crisis/" style="float: right;margin-left: 1em;margin-bottom: 0em" target="_blank"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-OZxCqDIzHoc/UG41ytTUvHI/AAAAAAAAR9w/JBjP0gAZV14/s225/225.jpg" alt=""></a><br />
This sick population control agenda is also being heavily promoted in Europe.</p>
<p>A recent article by <a href="http://www.infowars.com/eu-funded-group-outlines-draconian-population-control-scenarios-for-the-next-forty-years-2/" target="_blank" title="Jurriaan Maessen">Jurriaan Maessen</a> discussed a document entitled “<a href="http://seri.at/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/WP6_Scenarios_Storyline_Report_Cover.pdf" target="_blank" title="Scenarios for a One Planet Economy in Europe">Scenarios for a One Planet Economy in Europe</a>”  that was produced by a EU-funded think think called the “One Planet  Economy Network”.  One of the goals of the One Planet Economy Network is  to “help transform Europe to a One Planet Economy by 2050.”</p>
<p>“<a href="http://seri.at/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/WP6_Scenarios_Storyline_Report_Cover.pdf" target="_blank" title="Scenarios for a One Planet Economy in Europe">Scenarios for a One Planet Economy in Europe</a>”  examines four different scenarios that could play out as Europe moves  toward a “green” future.  The following is a quote from a section of the  report that discusses a scenario entitled “Breaking Point”….</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The EU must take strong measures to limit population  growth both in Europe, but more importantly in the rest of the world in  the face of increasing demand at a time when technological innovation  is stagnant and global shortages (e.g. of fossil fuels and agricultural  land) are pushing up prices. In some European countries, life expectancy  stagnates; in others it falls.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once again, we see an example of where population growth for “the  rest of the world” is considered to be absolutely crucial.  And that  tends to be the attitude of many of these radical humanists.  It is  always “someone else” that is the biggest part of the problem.</p>
<p>Farther down in the report, it is suggested that financial coercion could be used to motivate families to have less children….</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Beginning in 2012, one of the measures taken to  control population growth was to phase-out child benefits for  multi-children families. By 2020, benefits were only provided for up to a  maximum of 2 children. As the economy in general has become more labour  intensive, immigration policies were relaxed in order to attract low  skilled labour, especially for the agriculture sector. This further adds  to social tension in the EU. Bilateral trade deals require trading  partners to implement population control measures.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But population control measures are not just something that we will  see in the future.  The truth is that UN agencies and non-governmental  entities are already implementing population control measures all over  the globe.  They are often called “family planning programs” or “free  sterilization drives”, but the goal is always to get women to have less  children.</p>
<p>And in many of the wealthier countries we are also seeing fertility  levels steadily drop.</p>
<p>Thanks to all of the garbage in our food, air and  water it is getting harder and harder to get pregnant.</p>
<p>A recent article by <a href="http://naturalsociety.com/biotech-scientist-its-awesome-that-gmos-cause-infertility-death/" target="_blank" title="Anthony Gucciardi">Anthony Gucciardi</a>  included the text of an email from a biotech scientist who admitted  that he was aware that his work was contributing to reduced fertility.   What you are about to read is absolutely stunning….</p>
<p>*******************<br />
<a href="http://activistpost.net/crisis/" style="float: right;margin-left: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em" target="_blank"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Cr4b_paQky0/UG5OZTSlmlI/AAAAAAAAR_A/DgjHL80-ZGM/s200/01-200.gif" alt=""></a><br />
In the email, the biotech scientist known as ‘Ed’ explains how he  thinks it’s absolutely ‘awesome’ that GMOs are contributing to  infertility, as he believes the world is overpopulated. He also attacks  me personally for my work on warning the public over the dangers of GMOs  (particularly the latest news over the research linking GMOs to organ  failure and tumor development). As of right now we have not released the  full name of ‘Ed’ nor his organization, but we may in the future after  considering the legal concerns.</p>
<p><b>Here is the Full Email:</b></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am no traitor against humanity. <b>If this **** causes infertility… Awesome!!</b><br />
The world is over-populated, and people need to stop having children. This is one of earth’s largest problems </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If the earth wasn’t overpopulated, things like growth hormones wouldn’t EXIST.<br />
The reason they do, is that the earth cannot produce enough food on its own to feed us all. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This is why <b>GMO is actually saving the planet</b>. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>So **** you and your ********. I am doing humanity a ******* FAVOR!!!<br />
Sincerely, </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A REAL ‘traitor to humanity’ </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>– Ed</p>

<p>Many of those promoting genetically-modified foods for the public actually privately insist on organic foods <a href="http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2012/10/09/ge-food-supporters-insist-organic-foods.aspx" target="_blank" title="for their own families">for their own families</a>.</p>
<p>They know what they are doing, but they truly believe that it is good for the planet.</p>
<p>For these radical humanists, the ends often justify the means.  Many  of them are entirely convinced that humanity is only going to have a  bright future if the global population is reduced dramatically.  So they  are willing to take extraordinary measures for “the greater good”.</p>
<p>The mindset of some of these radicals is absolutely frightening.  For  example, Dave Foreman, the co-founder of Earth First, once said that <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/the-elite-believe-that-you-are-ruining-their-planet-and-they-want-you-to-stop-reproducing" target="_blank" title="reducing the global population">reducing the global population</a> to 100 million is one of his three primary goals….</p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>My three main goals would be to reduce human  population to about 100 million worldwide, destroy the industrial  infrastructure and see wilderness, with it’s [sic]full complement of species,  returning throughout the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This kind of philosophy rises to the surface in some of our most trusted publications quite often as well.</p>

</div>
<p>For example, <i>Time Magazine</i> once ran an article entitled “<a href="http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,20120611,00.html" target="_blank" title="How To Die">How To Die</a>” that explained why it is a good thing to kill off the elderly.</p>
<p><i>Newsweek</i> actually once ran an article entitled “<a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2009/09/11/the-case-for-killing-granny.html" target="_blank" title="The Case For Killing Granny">The Case For Killing Granny</a>“.</p>
<p>Sadly, there was not a massive national uproar over either of those  articles.  Yeah, a few people were upset, but most Americans did not get  seem too disturbed.</p>
<p>The truth is that the American public is starting to buy into the  propaganda that getting married and having children is not such a great  thing.</p>
<p>Today, an all-time low <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/america-lost-generation-census-2011-9" target="_blank" title="44.2%">44.2%</a> of all Americans between the ages of 25 and 34 are married, and fertility rates in the U.S. are steadily dropping.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/familysurvival.html" style="float: right;margin-left: 1em;margin-bottom: 0em"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ASIFGy_z7zU/UCFiDQK8GBI/AAAAAAAAROU/7AHejVY_hUE/s202/3.gif"></a>Back in 2008, the average number of children per woman in the U.S. was <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn22351-recession-pushes-us-birth-rates-to-an-alltime-low.html" target="_blank" title="2.1">2.1</a>.</p>
<p>By 2011, that number had fallen to <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn22351-recession-pushes-us-birth-rates-to-an-alltime-low.html" target="_blank" title="1.9">1.9</a>.</p>
<p>So the numbers are definitely going in the direction that population control advocates want. This twisted philosophy is even represented in the White House.  Barack Obama’s primary science advisor, John P. Holdren, once <a href="http://thetruthwins.com/archives/obamas-top-science-advisor-john-holdren-advocates-mass-sterilizations-forced-abortions-and-a-global-police-force" target="_blank" title="co-authored a book">co-authored a book</a>  in which he advocated the mass sterilization of American women.  The  following is just one of the incredibly disturbing quotes from Holdren’s  book….</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A program of sterilizing women after their  second or third child, despite the relatively greater difficulty of the  operation than vasectomy, might be easier to implement than trying to  sterilize men. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The development of a long-term sterilizing capsule that could  be implanted under the skin and removed when pregnancy is desired opens  additional possibilities for coercive fertility control. The capsule  could be implanted at puberty and might be removable, with official  permission, for a limited number of births.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And this population control agenda was even reflected in the new  health care law.  It is not an accident that sterilization won’t cost  women <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/they-want-to-sterilize-american-women-new-obamacare-regulation-makes-sterilization-100-free" target="_blank" title="a single penny">a single penny</a> under Obamacare.</p>
<p>They want U.S. women to choose sterilization.  They want to make it as easy for them as possible. The more women that get sterilized, the less children that will be running around.</p>
<p>There is so much more that could be written about the population  control agenda of these radical humanists.</p>

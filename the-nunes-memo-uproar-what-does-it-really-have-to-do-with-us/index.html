<p>There is another war taking place on Mount Olympus. Every day, more reports of thunder from lightning bolts hurled between factions of the gods can be heard on their channels–Fox News, CNN, MSNBC and more. This time, the kernel of the war focuses on the fact that a faction of the gods was caught spying on another god group.</p>
<p>All of this is most entertaining and has certainly gripped the attention of the god channels. But while some of the lesser gods weigh in on the veracity and import of the Nunes memo, the question must be asked–What does this have to do with the rest of us?</p>
<p>As we well know by now, thanks to Snowden’s revelations and continued reports of the methods and activities of the surveillance state, far more people are being impacted by the spy agencies than Citizen Carter Page or others in the Trump faction. The honest outrage generated by the Nunes memo should be tempered by the reality that spying on US citizens is the new normal.</p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

</script></div>

<p>And the outrageous fact of the spying does not end with simple surveillance. As growing numbers of Americans now know, surveillance is just one wrench in the toolbox of government. Engagement far more devastating than that provided by Peeping Toms is now at play.</p>
<p>Prompted by the stir created by the rumor of the memo’s contents, former NSA analyst Karen Melton Stewart made a concerted effort to turn over to Congressman Jim Jordan details concerning the extent to which the surveillance mechanisms had attached onto other programs, involving the use of unconventional weapons systems against US citizens.</p>
<p>Writing to Jordan, Stewart stated that the FISA abuses discussed in the memo are just the “tip of the iceberg.”</p>
<p>In a February 6 email to Congressman Jordan, who had engaged the press repeatedly with his statements of outrage concerning the memo, Stewart wrote “According to the Supreme Court decision, <em>Marbury v. Madison</em>, which has never been challenged much less overturned, any law that is passed in the United States, or any of its territories, which is contrary to the Constitution is void. This would apply to rules, regulations and directives too.” Stewart goes on to reveal invasive, non-consensual experimentation programs which she states is impacting thousands of Americans, involving “covert weapons testing, neurobiological weapons testing, secret illegal implantation of medical chips and other invasive devices, nano technology contamination, morgellons contamination, radiological poisoning, food and contact poisonings, gassings, etc….”</p>
<p>She cites the following Amendments to the Constitution as being abrogated by the testing programs:</p>
<p>4th Amendment – “The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.”</p>
<p>6th Amendment – “In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a public and speedy trial by an impartial jury of the sate and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law; and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusations; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for attaining a witness in his favor; and to have the assistance of counsel in his defense.”</p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>8th Amendment – “Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel or unusual punishments inflicted.”</p>

No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or the immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.”</p>
<p>Further buttressing her concerns, Stewart provided Congressman Jim Jordan with multiple articles concerning the nature of these non-consensual experimentation programs. In addition, a number of other people provided Jordan with statements concerning their experiences with non-consensual weapons testing. Writing from Washington, Crystal Starheart told Jordan that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have also been and am still victimized by surveillance targeted crimes by government personnel and contractors/operatives in the fraud Terrorist Watch List program.</p>
<p>The DHS/FBI/Fusion Centers and their connected civilian organized surveillance crime groups must be held accountable for their ongoing crimes against citizens like myself, and others including Karen Stewart. My physical health has been irreparably and permanently damaged by exposure to drug/chemical/biological agent(s) in conjunction with many other surveillance crimes committed against me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Requesting that her name be withheld, an individual from Montana wrote the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Mr. Jordan,</p>
<p>I am contacting you in support of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuses and related surveillance harassment allegations that Ms. Karen Stewart has brought to your attention. The Federal Government’s Intelligence Agencies have a long documented history of abusing the civil and human rights of the American people as noted in the Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations In Respect to Intelligence Activities – U.S. Senate (1976). This Committee also known as the Church Committee discovered illegal wiretapping, bugging, surveillance and harassment of the American people by the Central Intelligence Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Security Agency.</p>
<p>Additionally documentation from this investigation has produced voluminous transcripts and evidence uncovering covert surveillance programs such as the Huston Plan, named after Tom Charles Huston, Counsel and Staff Assistant to President Nixon which called for illegal activities such as wiretapping, burglaries, mail opening, and the kidnapping and secret deporting of radicals. What the Church Committee found is that these abuses were ongoing operations for the Intelligence Agencies and they had become part of their culture to get the job done at any costs and there is no congressional oversight. This culture of abusing our civil and human rights within the Intelligence Agencies has continued to permeate as the Agencies and their budgets have continued to grow and amass large amounts of our personal data.</p>
<p>Their utilization of private contractors such as Lockheed Martin to perform surveillance on individuals by tracking their internet activity, mail correspondence and perform physical covert and overt surveillance methods on individuals is abusive and it involves systematized racketeering and widespread civil and human rights abuses. There is an organized criminal system that operates within our Intelligence Agencies and their contractors. On December 20, 2017, President Trump declared a State of Emergency to deal with the individuals that are involved in serious human rights abuses or corruption by signing an Executive Order #13818. The human rights abuses extend far beyond just child trafficking, but includes surveillance and harassment methods utilized by our Intelligence Agencies against the American people…I am requesting your assistance to further investigate the surveillance abuse allegations that are being brought to your attention.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A recent survey done by NSA whistleblower Bill Binney has clocked in reports from over 500 experimental weapons test subjects. Speaking recently on the Alex Jones radio show, Binney, who worked at the NSA for more than 36 years, was quoted as saying that the</p>
<blockquote>
<p>agency’s goal of total population control would lead to the creation of a global surveillance apparatus.</p>

So in order to do that, you have to have knowledge of them to know who’s doing what so you can stop it, or manipulate it any way you want. <a href="https://everydayconcerned.net/2016/10/02/william-binneyinfowars-nsa-is-after-total-global-population-control/">(Source)</a></p>
<p>Binney has also acknowledged the existence of non-consensual experimentation projects. The website, Biggerthansnowden.com, states that …</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Binney has engaged in activism in support of the countless victims being tortured with electromagnetic weapons….He helps targeted individuals understand the bigger picture behind the subjugation of at least tens of thousands of Americans with electromagnetic weapons. He states that it’s about subverting democracy to expand the budgets &amp; power of criminal cliques within the military-industrial complex…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The US government has denied that these programs are in effect and has denied the use of unconventional weapons against US citizens. Recent news reports saw a different response from the US government when it was revealed that some of these weapon had been used against diplomats in Cuba. <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/sonic-weapon-attack-recording-cuba-havana-embassy-trump-castro-a8000796.html">Listen to the ‘sonic weapon attack’ allegedly used against US diplomats in Cuba.</a></p>
<p>This reporter followed up with Jordan’s office, leaving repeated messages for his press officer, Melika Wiloughby. Neither Willoughby nor anyone in Jordan’s office has responded to Stewart’s communications nor to this reporter’s queries.</p>
<p>Speaking on Fox News, Jordan had this to say about the Nunes memo: “It shocked me!” He went on to say that “…what I read today in that classified briefing room is as bad as I thought it was. And every single American citizen should have the ability to see that information to know exactly what our FBI was up to.”</p>
<p>I can only imagine that the air up there on Mt. Olympus has gone to Jordan’s head. But as is repeatedly being brought home to us, we mere mortals don’t factor into gods’ wars.</p>

<p><b>Louis James:</b> Doug, a lot of our readers have asked  about getting a second passport. I realize this is a large and complex  issue – several issues, actually – but would you care to go over the  basics of where to go and what to do? And for those not already thinking  about this, why?</p>
<p><b>Doug Casey:</b> Sure. We’ve talked  quite a bit about the increasing urgency of getting some of your assets  out of your home country, especially if it’s the United States. We’ve  talked about having stores of precious metals in safe places abroad, and  setting up bank and brokerage accounts abroad as well. I’ve said that  safest way to store wealth abroad is to buy property, which can’t be  seized by your home country without an act of war. The purchase of real  estate solves several issues all at once.</p>
<p>But that’s all about protecting assets; to protect yourself, getting a second passport is unfortunately very important.</p>
<p><b>LJ: </b>Why unfortunately?</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><b>DC:</b>  Because you shouldn’t have to need government papers to live as you  please. It used to be that a passport was a document that a ruler of one  country would give to a traveler to ask the rulers of other countries  to assist him in his travels. Now, instead of a convenience, it’s become  a required permit for travel. It’s degrading and actually runs counter  to the whole idea of the thing. The original purpose of a passport has  been turned upside down.</p>
<p><b>LJ:</b> Passports are becoming a world ID card – and they will be, once the governments all link up their databases.</p>
<p><b>DC:</b>  That’s exactly what they are, and I’m sure it’s going to get worse.  It’s funny the way people treat these things like some sort of holy  relic, or magical object – they are nothing but another government ID.  But since they are necessary in today’s world, you ought to have several  of them, for your own convenience. If nothing else, it prevents any one  government from basically placing you under house arrest by taking your  passport away from you.</p>

<b>LJ: </b>Do you really think  of it mostly in terms of convenience? Or do you sometimes think about  the potential for physical danger, should you find yourself in an <a href="http://www.caseyresearch.com/go/bwFLe/ATP" target="_blank"><i>Achille Lauro</i>-type situation</a> in which violent people who hate Americans select US passport holders for abuse?</p>
<p><b>DC: </b>That’s  definitely a good reason for Americans to have a second passport, and  increasingly for others, now that the war with Islam is under way. If  you ever get caught in harm’s way, it helps that nobody starts by  shooting all the people from countries they’ve never heard of.</p>
<p><b>LJ: </b>Round up all the Uruguayans!</p>
<p><b>DC:</b> Right – that just doesn’t happen. Another reason – certainly if you’re an American – is that <i>nobody</i> anywhere  in the world wants to open a bank account or a brokerage account for  you. It ranges from impossible to hard and inconvenient. It’s a subtle  and indirect form of exchange control that the US has already imposed. I  have no doubt controls will become much more formal and serious in the  near future.</p>
<p><b>LJ: </b>Are you saying that if I go to  Switzerland, and I look and sound like an American, but have a Mexican  passport, they’ll open a bank account for me?</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/noblemint.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-9DT5B1Ri41E/UVt54cFEZtI/AAAAAAAAUqg/3tSTxPLyGW0/s240/120x240.gif"></a><b>DC:</b> It depends. Here  in Uruguay, where I’m still hanging out on the beach, I went with a  friend from South Africa to open a bank account, using her South African  passport. I didn’t say a word, so I could have been a South African  too, for all they knew. Still, the bank officer asked her: “Are you also  a US citizen?” and “Are you resident in the US?”</p>
<p><b>LJ: The long arm of Uncle Sam keeps getting longer.</b></p>
<p><b>DC: </b>It  really is getting harder and harder. Banks really don’t want the  aggravations that come with dealing with “US persons” and their bullying  government. Of course, it’s all going to eventually backfire on the US,  but in the meantime it’s going to get worse.</p>
<p><b>LJ: </b>Yes – I don’t like it when they ask for my passport at hotels, and I hate it when they say they have to keep it.</p>
<p><b>DC: </b>As  well you should, for all kinds of reasons. You never know how good the  security at the hotel is, and the inconvenience of a lost or stolen  passport is substantial. I’d say a second one is a good thing to have,  just on principle. An alternative would be to get documents from some of  those people trying to set up new countries, like <a href="http://www.caseyresearch.com/go/bwFEx/ATP" target="_blank">Sealand</a>,  the WWII gun platform off the coast of England taken over by Roy Bates.  I spent an afternoon with him once, but foolishly never signed up as a  citizen. Oh well… Other outfits sell reproduction passports of defunct  or renamed countries like Rhodesia and British Honduras.</p>
<p><b>LJ: </b>I  shudder to think of what “inconvenience” means to a man who finds it  amusing to argue with immigration officials in back rooms in flyspeck  countries … But at any rate, mentioning purveyors of passports from  defunct countries underscores the importance of telling our readers that  there are a lot of scams out there, and that it pays to be very  skeptical of websites that claim to be able to set you up with  documents, corporations, and bank accounts overseas. There are freelance  thieves to worry about, and worse – governments trying to entrap  so-called tax evaders and money launderers. There’s no need to take such  risks when you can go to any of the many countries that encourage  immigration and permanent residency, and acquire government-issued  documents legally.</p>
<p><b>DC</b>: Yes, these are indeed  shark-infested waters. You really have to do things in a totally correct  and proper way. For instance, there always seem to be people running  around who have passports stolen from the issuing agency, and some fools  buy them, not realizing they’ll not only lose their money, but might  wind up in jail besides. But, even among perfectly legitimate documents,  not all passports are created equal.</p>
<p><b>LJ: </b>Why would that be?</p>
<p><b>DC:</b>  The defining characteristic of a “good” passport is how much visa-free  travel it allows. And by that I really mean visas that have to be  applied for, and approved, before the trip begins, as opposed to those  issued at the border. Avoiding those is the real key value.</p>
<p>In  spite of its reputation, a US passport is by no means the best one to  have. First, if you have one, you’re a US taxpayer, which is <i>very </i>inconvenient,  but it also means you need visas for a lot more countries than you  would with some other passport. Argentina, Chile, and Brazil, for  instance, all charge Americans about $150 to issue a visa. It’s a  perverse form of reciprocity, as that’s what the US government charges  their citizens. It’s the same kind of thinking that starts trade wars,  and I expect more of it in the years to come – but that’s another  subject.</p>
<p>Speaking of South America, two passports that are  relatively quick and easy to get are those from Uruguay and Paraguay.  Both countries are members of the Mercosur group of South American  countries, which offers some additional advantages to their nationals.</p>
<p>One  of the best, I’m given to understand – and this is constantly changing –  is a Singapore passport. I also understand that Singapore has a number  of ways to become a citizen in a relatively short period of time.</p>
<p><b>LJ: </b>What are some of the shortcuts to second citizenship?</p>
<p><b>DC:</b>  One of the best is if you have parents or grandparents from a country  that will give you citizenship on that basis. Ireland and Italy are  known for this. It’s true, under some circumstances, for the UK as well.  Saint Kitts is a relatively easy place to get a passport quite quickly,  but it involves a significant investment that adds up to a couple  hundred thousand dollars. Selling IDs is a significant source of income  for the island.</p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>And of course, in a number of countries you can  obtain citizenship, and hence documents, relatively easily by marrying a  national. Brazil is one, and a Brazilian passport is not a bad one to  have.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/expatguide.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/_qLAIskTQXUc/TZ9QqThBpRI/AAAAAAAAIG0/1ea27Wk9TKA/USam200.jpg"></a>There’s information on this out there, but there have been  scam reports done on this subject and many other sources that are simply  unreliable, so watch out. I don’t think there’s ever been a truly  definitive study done on all the ways, in all the 200 or so countries in  the world. I believe my book <i>The International Man</i> was the  first to really explore the ground – but it’s long out of date. Even if  there were a current book, it would have to be updated monthly to be of  real value – governments are always changing their rules. And when it  comes down to the particulars of a given situation, you’ll want to hire a  tax attorney and maybe an immigration one as well, to make sure  everything is done correctly.</p>
<p>It’s generally better not to try for  shortcuts, but to move to a place you like living in, at least part of  the year. Operating through the established, legally recognized  channels, you can get a passport in two to five years.</p>
<p><b>LJ: </b>Okay. And, to be clear, the US allows second citizenships?</p>
<p><b>DC: </b>Yes.  Many countries don’t, and are strict about it. Others don’t, but look  the other way. You may feel you want to keep your US documents for  various practical reasons, but remember that keeping your US citizenship  means remaining a US taxpayer, which is most undesirable.</p>

</div>
<p><b>LJ: </b>I  read that if your income is less than $100,000 per year and you live  abroad, it’s not taxed, so maybe the tax issue is less important to  people who earn less than you?</p>
<p><b>DC:</b> That’s true,  but that exemption only applies on income earned outside the United States. You  still pay capital gains taxes, and taxes on US-sourced income. I also  understand that under current law, until 2013, there’s a $5 million  exemption on appreciated expatriated assets. That means there’s a window  closing soon on some of the benefits of getting rid of your US  citizenship.</p>
<p><b>LJ: </b>Any reasons other than taxes  you’d want to get rid of your US citizenship? If I were young enough,  I’d worry about conscription, for example.</p>
<p><b>DC:</b>  That’s a very good reason. More generally, as long as you’re a citizen  of a country, that country’s government is going to treat you like its  property. So, if you are going to be a citizen of any place, which is  unfortunately necessary, it’s better to be a citizen of a small and  backward country, or one that just doesn’t have the ability or interest  to monitor all of its citizens like prison inmates, as the US does.</p>
<p><b>LJ: </b>I  hear that. It’s such a pity that America the beautiful has turned into  the United State and is rapidly marching down the road to serfdom … I  really loved America.</p>
<p><b>DC:</b> Nothing lasts forever,  Lobo. It’s suicidal to let sentimentality blind you to reality. But,  eternal optimist that I am, it’s always good to look at one of the major  bright sides of the ongoing financial and economic collapse. Namely  that the governments of most advanced nation-states are bankrupt.  There’s a chance that some of them will be forced to cut back on their  most noisome activities. There’s even a chance that one or two will be  completely hollowed out and will exist mostly in theory, like Rome in  the late 5th century.</p>
<p>It’s very hard to predict what  will happen, so it’s best to have a Plan B. And a Plan C. Unfortunately,  most people have a medieval serf mentality – although they don’t know  it, and probably wouldn’t admit it even if they did – and have no plan  at all, because they think everything is fine.</p>
<p><b>LJ: </b>I agree. And you know I’m diversifying out of the US as well. Any other essential points?</p>
<p><b>DC: </b>Yes,  remember that getting a second passport is just part of a larger  “permanent traveler” strategy. The ideal is to live in one place, have  your citizenship in another, your banks and brokers in other  jurisdictions, and your business dealings in yet others. That makes it  very inconvenient for any one government to control you. You don’t want  all your eggs in one basket – that just makes it easier for them to grab  them all. I understand it may not be easy for most people to structure  their affairs that way. That’s exactly why most serfs stayed serfs; it  was hard and scary to think of anything other than what they were told  they should do.</p>
<p><b>LJ: </b>Understood. Thanks for the guidance.</p>

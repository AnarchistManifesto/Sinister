<p><i><b>From Chemtrails to Directed Energy Weapons, the System is Set on Total Control</b></i></p>
<p>There has been much speculation in the last few years as to the authenticity of the claims of “chemtrail” spraying of the ionosphere by secretive groups for unknown reasons, with such claims generally receiving the scorn of tinfoil hat insanity. Distinguished from “contrails,” the normal water and ice crystal formations that result from aircraft exhaust vapor, “chemtrails” is the popular name for aerosol spraying by planes in different layers of the atmosphere under the cover of numerous global geoengineering programs.</p>
<p><i>(Image: HAARP and the aurora borealis. Image: redicecreations.com)</i></p>
<p>Is this possible? Could there be widespread global aerosol spraying programs? Not only is this possible, it’s already being done, and has been going on for decades. With origins in World War II<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_seeding"> cloud-seeding</a>, the development of weather modification and mass geoengineering programs is no longer even covert, with numerous papers, programs and examples now made public.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>With this in mind, it is somewhat shocking the number of trolls and deniers that exist, telling us daily these are fictions of paranoid conspiracists, while any of the above notions can be easily verified with Google and a few minutes of research. Of course, this is not likely to happen, as the public has never heard of the Royal Society, much less “<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/feb/06/bill-gates-climate-scientists-geoengineering">geoengineering</a>,” since Kim Kardashian’s butt is a much more accurate weathervane of the tides of public interest (a very big weathervane).</p>

<p>In this article, I will document several papers from officialdom, including scientific journals and white papers that demonstrate the programs are real. Not only will we see they are real, we will in fact see these programs integrate with one another and provide the establishment the potential for tremendously disastrous social engineering effects, as well as environmental dangers that result from such dark pragmatic <i>scientistic</i> ends.</p>

<p>Our first document under survey is the <a href="https://royalsociety.org/%7E/media/Royal_Society_Content/policy/publications/2009/8693.pdf">Royal Society report “Geoengineering the Climate: Science, Governance and Uncertainty,” a 2009 paper</a> that details the various potentialities for numerous approaches to curbing CO2 emissions, naturally tied in with population reduction and a return to neo-feudalistic model of global economic realignment.</p>
<p>Given that the United Nations was established by Royal Society backing, the <a href="http://21stcenturywire.com/2014/04/21/chinese-takeaway-globalist-gangsters-use-agenda-21-sustainability-for-nevada-land-grabs/">“Agenda 21” implementation</a> we have heard much about in the last few decades is part of a much larger strategy foisted upon the global community by these very shadow players. I have detailed previously the connection between mass depopulation, economic overhauls and realignment and the so-called dangers of resource-based economies being directed into a staged crisis by the corporate elite.</p>

<p>In perfect establishment orthodoxy, the Royal Society paper promotes all the classic fear-based canards of melting ice caps, Malthusian disasters, etc., that have been the harpy screech for some 40 years, not the least of which has manifested. However, for our purposes here, we see the Royal Society is very much a proponent of atmospheric aerosol spraying:</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>Mimicking the effects of volcanic eruptions by injecting sulphate aerosols into the lower stratosphere. (pg. XII)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>Of the Solar Radiation Management methods considered, stratospheric aerosols are currently the most promising because their effects would be more uniformly distributed than for localised Solar Radiation Management methods, they could be much more readily implemented than space-based methods, and would take effect rapidly (within a year or two of deployment). (pg. XIII)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em" href="http://activistpost.net/empsurvival.html" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-OXdpVcfytfk/UCq-RMfyLsI/AAAAAAAARZ0/ysoPUGqDNE4/s200/200x200_1.jpg" alt=""></a>This is an interesting claim, as <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/martin-rees-we-shouldnt-attach-any-weight-to-what-hawking-says-about-god-2090421.html">Lord Rees</a>, an important member and contributor to this report <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFaPo2Z0KNc">authored a book, <i>Just Six Numbers</i>, on the mathematical tuning of the universe, expounding how it demonstrates an amazing balance of symmetry creating the conditions for life.</a> Yet here, we are threatened with humans tipping the perfect balance because humans exist as carbon-based beings, drive cars and fart – cows, too! Like an inside joke from the kleptocryptocracy, the double-talk of promoting a universe with telos and order, and at the same time requiring a mass genocide and reorganization by the scientific priest-class smacks more of a con job than a legitimate scientific endeavor. Rees would have us believe the universe perfectly balances itself to “create” life, and then the IPCC and U.N. will step in to save us from a conversely chaotic, meaningless universe. Which is it? The following quote is highly revealing:</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>The greatest challenges to the successful deployment of geoengineering may be the social, ethical, legal and political issues associated with governance, rather than scientific and technical issues. For some methods, like ambient air capture, pre-existing national mechanisms are likely to be sufficient, for others, such as ocean iron fertilisation, existing international mechanisms may be relevant but require some modification. There will however be some methods, particularly those that require transboundary activity or which have transboundary effects, for example stratospheric aerosols or space-based mirrors, which may require new international mechanisms. Appropriate governance mechanisms for deployment should be established before Carbon Dioxide Removal or Solar Radiation Management methods are actually needed in practice. (pg. 13)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Translation: The pesky humans (carbon) and their morals will get in the way of our program, so we will need to do it covertly under the guise of science and global crises. Space-based mirrors will be needed to aid in the reflecting process, we are told, yet if my analysis is correct, and the invention of the climate threat is a scam, the real reason for “space-based” technology of this sort would likely be weaponized. Modern science itself is not based on altruism – on the contrary, most modern technological advancements are based around militarization and global population management (and destruction).</p>
<p>Have we seen any examples of some space-based weapon with similar features?  In fact we have, as I have written numerous times about the Skynet grid that will incorporate the Internet, global tracking, micro chipped humans and directed energy weapons. A “mirror” in space to reflect “radiation,” or a space-based directed energy weapon named Skynet – which do you think is more likely?  <a href="http://www.fas.org/spp/military/docops/usaf/2025/v3c2/v3c2-4.htm#Implanted%20Microscopic%20Chip">The 1996 fas.org paper from the Air Force has Skynet described as “</a><b><a href="http://www.fas.org/spp/military/docops/usaf/2025/v3c2/v3c2-4.htm#Implanted%20Microscopic%20Chip">Figure 4-1. Cyber Situation Vision: “Eye” See Everything.”</a>   </b>I believe this “eye” is the real “mirror,” as the geoengineering programs are intimately connected to weaponized weather control programs and psychological warfare, as we will see.</p>

<p>A wide range of types of particles could be released into the stratosphere with the objective of scattering sunlight back to space. Important factors that differentiate the effects of different types of particles include their size, and whether or not they conduct electricity (Teller et al. 1997,2002). For non-conducting particles, the optimal size for scattering sunlight is a few tenths of a micron. Particles much larger than this become effective at scattering outgoing long wave (heat) radiation and thus have potential to cause a warming influence. (pg. 29)</p>

<p>The Teller mentioned is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Teller">Dr. Edward Teller</a>, the maker of they Hydrogen bomb and physicist who is a big name in pioneering atmospheric spraying and weather modification.  <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/geoengineering-and-climate-change/">Teller is cited often in on these reports and papers, and his high pedigree as a bomb manufacturer should immediately raise eyebrows concerning his weather and climate modification designs. </a> Is the bomb creator now suddenly a humanitarian who wants to save earth from the “climate” and “carbon”?  Or are they part of the shadow military industrial subversion complex that seeks full spectrum dominance over all life?  Let’s be realistic here.  The manipulation and control envisioned here is the <b>weaponization of the entirety of man’s environment</b>, ultimately for the purpose of control and depopulation: <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jul/11/the-ultimate-goal-of-the-nsa-is-total-population-control">The same establishment behind the NSA and its eye in the sky is behind the climate façade</a>.</p>

<p>Various other types of stratospheric aerosol particles have also been suggested (Teller et al. 1997; Blackstock et al. 2009; Keith in press (b); Submission: Katz). Engineered aerosols might enable scattering that did not produce so much diffuse illumination, potentially circumventing a significant side-effect of sulphate aerosols. Alternative materials might also avoid the coagulation and vaporisation problems that will be significant for sulphate aerosols. Finally, it is possible that advanced engineered particles could be designed that had longer lifetimes, or that were lofted out of the lower stratosphere, so reducing the impact of the aerosol on ozone chemistry, or enabling radiative forcing to be concentrated in special locations such as the polar regions.

<p>Is this a hint at nanotech or RFID “dust” that might be sprayed for the purpose of creating <a href="http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/Internet-of-Things">the “Internet of Things,”</a> a Google-associated project that aims to coat the surface of the globe with a form of nanotech? While there has been much speculation regarding this in alternative media, we do know plans for an Internet of Things are real, <a href="http://www.wired.com/2012/03/petraeus-tv-remote/">even to the extent of your dishwasher spying on you as former CIA head David Petraeus stated</a>, as well as further designs for nano “dust.” The report states, back in 2009, engineered particles would have a longer lifespan, and presumably this means nanotechnology. The report does cite two papers dealing with <a href="http://nanotech.lawbc.com/tags/royal-commission-on-environmen/">nanotechnology</a> and <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/documents/lords-committees/science-technology/st124royalsociety.pdf">food</a>, so we can assume this notion is not far-fetched. In analyzing these documents, it is important to remember <a href="http://www.infowars.com/enviro-eugenicists-announce-mass-die-off/">this establishment is operating under a worldview of eugenics and biotech that has long dropped the Hitlerian racial component for the pragmatic Fabian approach where the entire globe is a test lab</a>.</p>

<p><b>NRL Scientists Produce Densest Artificial Ionospheric Plasma Clouds Using HAARP</b></p>
<p>Our next piece of evidence concerns the US Naval use of HAARP, the infamous Alaskan facility that pioneered weather modification and weaponization.  Some have speculated that HAARP is now outdated and purely a research facility nowadays, yet recent papers such as the Navy’s work with plasma as well as the Stanford documents I will cite below speak otherwise.  Newer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foBqPwmwQqQ">models of manipulation do appear to be connected with Nexrad and Doppler towers</a>, particularly in regard to harnessing lightning as DARPA’s budget shows (<a href="http://sincedutch.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/darpa_fy14pb.pdf">see here, page 55</a>).  However, HAARP is still an important part of that research, if we are to believe these reports.  It is also important to keep in mind the Navy is a defense and wartime institution, not a humanitarian one.  This supports my above thesis that weather and geoengineering strategies are for militaristic purposes, not the “common good.”  <a href="http://21stcenturywire.com/2014/02/18/weather-control-climate-change-deception-other-global-concerns/">21stCenturyWire writer Shawn Helton explains of HAARP</a>:</p>

<p>DARPA and the Navy working together on plasma manipulation in the atmosphere – it sounds like a nightmare from Nikola Tesla following a bad case of indigestion.  DARPA is the establishment’s crypto weaponized tech arm of the military industrial complex, giving us the Internet itself, and <a href="http://jaysanalysis.com/2014/09/28/tron-1982-the-ultimate-predictive-programming/">here we see they are very much interested in directed energy weapons and weather modification</a>.  Given that the Anglo-American establishment has the same ruling elite, my connection between the Royal Society’s paper on geoengineering and the US military’s testing of directed plasma energy logically converge.  This doesn’t sound like your garden variety, mass consumption physics we are fed in establishment academia, but something akin to the energetic-based<i> hidden metaphysics</i> I have been speaking of, more along the lines of Tesla and Platonic <i>aether</i>.  Did you learn about directed energy weapons and plasma balls in your college physics course?  On the contrary, <a href="http://jaysanalysis.com/2014/06/17/the-cult-of-scientism-and-nikola-teslas-aether/">the cult of scientism purposefully feeds bunk science to the masses, as I have expounded here</a>.</p>

<p>Next in our series of documentation is the Stanford University’s database dedicated to very low and extremely low-frequency programs.  The radio waves mentioned above are merely one piece of the massive programs based at universities and government institutions globally focused on environmental dominance.  Stanford stands out as a major hub of such programs, and blasting the atmosphere with such frequencies reveals much deeper designs than mere “weather experiments.”  HAARP has long utilized VLF/ELF waves to cause different effects in weather patterns, but what we see in the VLF group is the synthesis of all the above.

<p>Skeptics and deniers refuse to make the integrated connections I am because they cannot grasp the concept of compartmentalization, wherein various scientific enclaves are working for some very specific ends. These ends, however, are ultimately for the goals of an establishment with a manifesto of global genocide, from the Georgia Guidestones, to Ted Turner to Al Gore to the Royal Society.</p>
<p>Globalist technocrats from Brzezinski to Toeffler to Bill Gates have also long been vocal on Geoengineering and ELF/VLF manipulation and their military uses, which brings me to my concluding example. Col. Michael Aquino, founder of the Temple of Set, and military psy op commander co-authored a famous 2003 paper on psychological warfare titled: <a href="https://archive.org/stream/pdfy-Mv-q4qGq8_TBPcwL/Michael%20Aquino%20%28US%20Satanist%29%20-%20From%20PSYOP%20to%20MindWar%20-%20The%20Psychology%20of%20Victory%20%281980%29_djvu.txt">“From PSYOP to MindWar: The Psychology of Victory,”</a> in which the footnotes at the end describe just the nefarious scenario Cohen warned of and are best cited in their entirety. Aquino and Vallely write:</p>

Atmospheric EM activity is regularly altered by such phenomena as sunspot eruptions and gravitational stresses which distort the  Earth’s magnetic field.

<p>There you go – a master of psychological warfare admits all the connections I made above.  Humans are walking, energetic beings that vibrate at a cellular level at various frequencies.  Through mass manipulation of ELF waves, the frequencies can be manipulated through the atmosphere (geoengineering), as well as through mediums such as television and media broadcasts.  We know the monkey lab in <a href="http://www2.gsu.edu/%7Ewwwcbs/pdf/Hopper%20et%20al%20%282012%29%20AJP.pdf">Bastrop, Texas focuses on tuning flicker rates to specific speeds to cause hypnotic effects</a>, so we can deduce similar programs are at work involving frequency manipulation with the entire environment, which is key.</p>
<p>It is not merely an attack on some single aspect of organisms, but a dominance of all aspects of organic life.  The technocratic dream of transhumanist transcendence is the reason for all this, the assumption being that to go to the next level, the existing order must be utilized for mass experimentation to determine which genetic strands can best adapt and conversely which means are the best appropriation to attaining singularity in a Skynet-ruled, RFID dust-covered nanotech planet.  In the wake of the destruction, the forced Darwinian evolution will cause a “leap” in those able to adapt, pure order out of designed chaos.  “Chemtrails” and geoengineering are clearly a part of this mass engineering.  When we step outside the compartmentalized framework, we can clearly see the pattern I have elucidated emerge.</p>

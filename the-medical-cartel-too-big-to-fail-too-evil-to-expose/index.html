<b><a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2013/05/the-medical-cartel-too-big-to-fail-too.html">Activist Post</a></b></p>
<p>There are several reasons why the medical cartel is too big to fail: the enormous amount of money at stake; its aim to control populations.</p>
<p>In this article, I want to examine a related reason.</p>
<p>Suppose it was discovered that thousands of bridges around the US were in imminent danger of collapsing?  Not because maintenance and repair were lacking, not because the materials used to build them were cheap and shoddy.  But because the original designs were inadequate and broke basic rules of engineering.</p>
<p>Suppose five or six major manufacturers built their automobiles so the vast majority of power derived from the engines was transferred to one wheel?</p>
<p>Suppose the US Dept. of Agriculture recommended that all farmers spray their crops with heavy chlorine instead of water?</p>
<p>In other words, the science itself is fraudulent.</p>
<p>This revelation, above all, is what the medical cartel tries to guard against.  Their profession has shoved in all its chips on the propaganda proposition that it does impeccable science.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>Science sells.  The appearance of it sells.  It’s the foundation stone of many industries.</p>
<p>Were that stone to crack and shatter, all bets would be off.  A titanic fraud would come to light.  The kind of fraud that would both freeze people’s minds and blow them away.</p>
<p>Science is the most powerful rationalization in the modern world.  Consensus reality would fail and disperse without it.</p>
<p>As I’ve covered before, the most conservative mainstream estimate of medically caused death in America is 225,000 people per year.  Every credential behind that figure is immaculate.</p>

<p>
The author of the paper that presented the statistics was the late Dr. Barbara Starfield, a revered public health expert who worked for many years at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health.</p>
<p>Her review, “Is US health the best in the world?”, was published on July 26th, 2000, in the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i>.</p>
<p>Starfield’s breakdown was as follows: the medical system kills 119,000 people a year in the US as a result of maltreatment in hospitals.  The other 106,000 people are killed by FDA-approved medicines.</p>
<p>The FDA must approve every drug as safe and effective before it is released for public use.</p>
<p>It’s the medicines I want to focus on in this article.  106,000 deaths a year translates to an astonishing 1,060,000 deaths per decade.</p>

<p>Clinical trials are conducted.  Reports of those trials are written.  The reports, the studies, are published in peer-reviewed medical journals.  The studies ARE the science.</p>
<p>If a million people per decade are being killed by the drugs, then a huge number of published studies proclaiming the drugs are safe are sheer fraud.  There is no other way to put it.</p>
<p>This statement from Marcia Angell, former editor of the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>, echoes the fact:</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>It is simply no longer possible to believe much of the clinical research that is published, or to rely on the judgment of trusted physicians or authoritative medical guidelines. I take no pleasure in this conclusion, which I reached slowly and reluctantly over my two decades as an editor of <i>The New England Journal of Medicine</i>. (Marcia Angell, MD, The New York Review of Books, January 15, 2009)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The medical cartel rests on cataclysmic fraud, scientific fraud.</p>
<p>Imagine what would happen if just one major media outlet decided to take on this story and push it for all it’s worth.  Not merely an article or two—an ongoing campaign of relentless exposure.</p>
<p>The silence from that quarter speaks volumes about the controlled press and what it stands for.</p>
<p>Over the years, I’ve written much about the FDA.  I thought I’d assemble a small fraction of it in one place, to reveal what this federal agency is really all about and why it should be dismantled, amid a blizzard of prosecutions and convictions for negligent homicide and, yes, murder.</p>
<p>The discovery of a page, on the FDA’s own website, proves the FDA is fully aware that:</p>
<p>the drugs it certifies as safe have been killing Americans, at the rate of 100,000 per year.</p>
<p>The FDA website page is available under the heading, “Why Learn About Adverse Drug Reactions.”  You can google it.</p>
<p>The FDA takes no blame, no responsibility for its own actions, and yet it admits the death statistics are accurate.</p>
<p>Understand this very clearly. No medical drug in America can be released for public use until and unless the FDA states it is safe. The FDA is the agency that makes every such decision on every drug. The buck stops there.</p>
<p>Yes, the FDA has a “special relationship” with the pharmaceutical industry. Yes, the FDA utilizes doctors on their drug-approval panels that have ties to the pharmaceutical industry. But, in the end, it is the FDA official seal that opens the gate and permits a drug to be prescribed by doctors and sold in the US.</p>
<p>In all my research on this medical-drug holocaust, I have never found a case in which any FDA employee was censured, fired, or criminally prosecuted for the killing effects of these drugs.</p>
<p>That is a track record Organized Crime would be proud of, and the comparison is not frivolous.</p>
<p>On this FDA website page, the FDA also readily admits that medical drugs are the fourth leading cause of death in America, ahead of pulmonary disease, diabetes, AIDS, pneumonia, accidents, and automobile fatalities.</p>
<p>The FDA website page also states there are 2 million serious adverse reactions (ADRs) from the ingestion of medical drugs, annually, in the US.  That would be 20 million ADRs per decade.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/stepoutsidethebox.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-kADbI3spO2M/TwILKt_It9I/AAAAAAAANvU/F0N-dw_gGR4/s261/cancer.png"></a>When the FDA says “serious,” they aren’t talking about headaches or slight dizziness or temporary nausea. “Serious” means stroke, heart attack, neurological damage; destruction of that magnitude.</p>
<p>Examining these figures for death and debilitation, can you find any comparable documented crime in the American landscape?  This is the kind of story that would make Watergate look like a Sunday-school picnic.</p>
<p>If a paper like the <i>New York Times</i> let loose their hounds to relentlessly explore the horror, I assure you that, in time, doctors and medical bureaucrats and even drug-company employees would come out of the woodwork with confessions, and the resultant explosions and outcries would shake the medical/pharmaceutical foundations of America and the planet.</p>
<p>It would shake and destroy the SCIENCE.</p>
<p>But these major media outlets are an intrinsic part of the Matrix that protects and sustains the crimes and the criminals. It isn’t just drug-advertising profits that keep the leading newspapers and television networks silent. It’s collusion to protect “a revered institution”—the medical system.</p>
<p>Also at stake is Obamacare. The connection is vivid and unmistakable. Millions more Americans, previously uninsured, will be drawn into the system and subjected to the very drugs are killing and maiming people at such a horrific rate.</p>
<p>Where has the US Department of Justice been all these years? Is there any way, under the sun, that a million deaths per decade can be excused? Is there any way the FDA and the drug companies can float safely in the upper atmosphere of privilege, while the concept of justice retains any meaning? Where are criminal prosecutions?</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the FDA pursues an agenda of attacking nutritional supplements, and the latest federal regulations classify these supplements as “potentially dangerous”—despite the fact that supplements have a record of safety that is astonishing.</p>
<p>It is time for the public to realize that 100,000 people dying every year in the US, because they take medical drugs, is the equivalent of 33 airliner crashes into the Twin Towers, every year, year after year.</p>
<p>If you were a medical reporter for a major media outlet in the US, and you knew the above fact, wouldn’t you make it a priority to say something, write something, do something?</p>
<p>I’m talking about people like Sanjay Gupta (CNN, CBS), Gina Kolata (NY Times), Tim Johnson (ABC News), and Thomas Maugh II (LA Times).</p>
<p>And with that, let’s get to another smoking gun.  The citation is: BMJ June 7, 2012 (BMJ 2012:344:e3989).  Author, Jeanne Lenzer.</p>
<p>Lenzer refers to a report by the Institute for Safe Medication Practices: “It calculated that in 2011 prescription drugs were associated with two to four million people in the US experiencing ‘serious, disabling, or fatal injuries, including 128,000 deaths.’”</p>
<p>The report called this “one of the most significant perils to humans resulting from human activity.”</p>
<p>And here is the final dagger.  The report was compiled by outside researchers who went into the FDA’s own database of “serious adverse [medical-drug] events.”</p>
<p>Therefore, to say the FDA isn’t aware of this finding would be absurd.  The FDA knows.</p>
<p>Since the Department of Homeland Security is working its way into every nook and corner of American life, hyper-extending its mandate to protect all of us from everything, maybe DHS should stop tracking every move we make and simply raid and arrest all employees of the FDA as terrorists.  The details could be sorted out later.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/superfoods.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 0em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" class="noshadow" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-N2GOFRKd8Vs/UF4PWWZ5dsI/AAAAAAAARz4/tuwcrewmlWA/s316/herbalcures.png" style="background: none;border: none" width="160"></a>How many smoking guns do we need before a sitting president shuts down the FDA buildings, fumigates them, and builds a monument to dead Americans the FDA has driven into their graves?</p>
<p>Do we need 100,000 smoking guns?  Do we need relatives of the people who’ve all died, in the span of, say, merely a year, from the poisonous effects of FDA-approved medical drugs, to bring their corpses and coffins to the doors of FDA headquarters?</p>
<p>And let me ask another question.  If instead of drugs like warfarin, dabigatran, levofloxacin, carboplatin, and lisinopril (the five leading killers in the FDA database), the 100,000 deaths per year were led by gingko, ginseng, vitamin D, niacin, and raw milk, what do you think would happen?</p>
<p>I’ll tell you what would happen.  SEALS, Delta Force, SWAT teams, snipers, predator drones, tanks, and infantry would be attacking every health-food store in America.  The resulting fatalities would be written off as necessary collateral damage in the fight to keep America safe and healthy.</p>
<p>But you see, the routine deaths of 100,000 Americans a year, after the FDA has certified the drugs are SAFE, isn’t a “recognized political issue.”</p>
<p>Such is the power of the medical cartel.  All those phony stories in the press, reported dutifully by so-called medical reporters?  The stories about maybe-could-be-possible-miracle breakthroughs just over the horizon of state-of-the-art research?  Those stories are there to obscure the very, very hard facts of medically-caused death on the ground.</p>
<p>The buck stops at the FDA.</p>
<p>Imagine this.  You go to an FBI web page and read the following: “Killings committed by FBI agents are the third leading cause of death in America every year.”</p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>Yet somehow, the FDA gets away with its crimes, its homicides.  There are no alarm bells, no arrests, no hearings, no public statements, no press reactions, no shakeups at the Agency.</p>
<p>The power of the medical cartel is gigantic.</p>
<p>When I was running for a Congressional seat from the 29th District of California, in 1994, and during my participation in the Health Freedom movement of that period, I insisted we had to take the attack to the FDA.  We had to make their crimes public.</p>
<p>I was told by the people who were leading the charge for Health Freedom that priority had to be given to passing a law that would protect us all from attacks on nutritional supplements.  Then, when we had that law, we could think about going after the FDA.</p>
<p>Well, we got the law, which only gave us temporary protection, and afterward there was no “going after the FDA.”  It was suddenly a dead issue.</p>
<p>I remember the people who said, “Don’t attack the FDA.”  I remember their attitudes, their faces, their words.  They were not my friends, and they weren’t your friends.  Some of them were yuppies selling “let’s be nice” New Age sentiment.  A few were most likely plants who had infiltrated the Health Freedom movement to water it down.</p>
<p>Various liars sell their lies through various strategies.</p>
<p>I assure you, there are doctors out there who know the statistics on medically caused death in the US.  They know about the drugs that kill.  They know what’s going on.  They know the FDA is accountable.  They remain silent.  They feel no pressure to make a public statement.  They’re living under the umbrella of protection provided by the government and the press and the medical system.</p>
<p>These doctors are silent witnesses to ongoing mass murder.  Just as the FDA is a silent witness to its own mass-murdering practices.  And of course, the doctors write the prescriptions for the drugs.</p>
<p>Obama, Bush, Clinton; none of these men have indicated the slightest awareness of the “problem.”  Did they know?  Do they know?  Just as I predicted, correctly, that the FDA knows, I say these men do know.  They prefer to remain silent as well.  They don’t want to touch this genocidal crime.  They don’t have the character or the courage.</p>
<p>Presidents and deans of medical schools know.  Teachers at these schools know.  Pharmaceutical executives know.  Medical researchers know.  The CDC knows.  The World Health Organization knows.  Editors and reporters at major press outlets know.  The DEA knows.  The US Dept. of Justice knows.</p>
<p>As far as the public is concerned, a matrix of hypnotic effect and cognitive dissonance is the obstacle.  People find it extremely difficult to believe that a federal agency, in broad daylight, year after year, countenances and sustains the unnecessary deaths of 100,000 people.</p>

<p>People want to believe that a crime of this boggling magnitude would already have been prosecuted to the full extent of the law.</p>
<p>People want to believe the secular religion known as Medicine is devoted to healing in all its forms.</p>

<p>People want to believe that, since doctors can put accident victims back together in one piece and can set broken bones and temporarily reduce inflammation, the practice of medicine must be uniformly successful across the board.</p>
<p>People want to believe in SCIENCE.</p>
<p>In a stunning 2012 interview with Truthout’s Martha Rosenberg, former FDA drug reviewer, Ronald Cavanagh, exposed the FDA as a relentless criminal mafia protecting its client, Big Pharma, with a host of mob strategies.</p>
<p>Cavanagh: “…widespread [FDA] racketeering, including witness tampering and witness retaliation.”</p>
<p>“I was threatened with prison.”</p>
<p>“One [FDA] manager threatened my children…I was afraid that I could be killed for talking to Congress and criminal investigators.”</p>
<p>Cavanagh reviewed new drug applications made to the FDA by pharmaceutical companies.  He was one of the holdouts at the Agency who insisted the drugs had to be safe and effective before being released to the public.</p>
<p>But honest appraisal wasn’t part of the FDA culture, and Cavanagh  swam against the tide, until he realized his life and the life of his children was on the line.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/noglasses.html" style="float: right;margin-left: 1em;margin-bottom: 0em" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-9NVXYpcxdr8/UHMzaY7R2OI/AAAAAAAAAPU/enRFdAsV4co/s300/ad5%25285%2529.jpg" alt=""></a>What was his covert task at the FDA?  “Drug reviewers were clearly told not to question drug companies and that our job was to approve drugs.”  In other words, rubber stamp them.  Say the drugs were safe and effective when they were not.</p>
<p>Cavanagh’s recalls a meeting where a drug-company representative flat-out stated that his company had paid the FDA for a new-drug approval.  Paid for it.  As in bribe.</p>
<p>He remarks that the drug pyridostigmine, given to US troops to prevent the effects of nerve gas, “actually increased the lethality” of certain nerve agents.</p>
<p>Cavanagh recalls being given records of safety data on a drug—and then his bosses told him which sections not to read.  Obviously, they knew the drug was dangerous and they knew exactly where, in the reports, that fact would be revealed.</p>
<p>As I mentioned above, the original study-review on medically caused death in America was written by Dr. Barbara Starfield and published in the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association.</i></p>
<p>Three years ago, shortly before her death, I interviewed Dr. Starfield.  I asked her whether any government agency had ever contacted her about her findings, in the nine years since publication</p>
<p>“No,” she said.</p>
<p>I asked her whether she was aware of any federal agency undertaking action to remedy the horrific killing effects of the US medical system.</p>
<p>“No,” she said.</p>
<p>Try this image: you are a gatekeeper. Your job, on the first day of every year, is to unlock the gate and leave it open, so people can pass through. But you know that, when you open the gate, 100,000 people who pass through will die in the following year. Yet, every January 1, you keep opening the gate.</p>
<p>That’s what the FDA is. That particular gatekeeper.</p>
<p>But of course, the people at the FDA are just like us.  They wouldn’t do THAT, they wouldn’t do THAT, they wouldn’t do that…</p>
<p>But they did.  They do.  They continue to do it.</p>

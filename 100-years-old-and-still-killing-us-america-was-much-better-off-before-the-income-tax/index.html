<p>Did you know that the greatest period of economic growth in American  history was during a time when there was absolutely no federal income  tax?  Between the end of the Civil War and 1913, there was an explosion  of economic activity in the United States unlike anything ever seen  before or since.  Unfortunately, a federal income tax was instituted in  1913, and this year it turned 100 years old.  But there was no fanfare,  was there?  There was no celebration because the federal income tax is  universally hated.  Sadly, most Americans just assume that there is no  other option to an income tax.  Most Americans just assume that it has  always been with us and that it will always be with us.</p>
<p>This year, the  American people will shell out approximately <a href="http://cnsnews.com/news/article/tax-freedom-day-2013-april-18-five-days-later-last-year" target="_blank" title="$4.22 trillion">$4.22 trillion</a>  in state and federal income taxes.  That amount is equivalent to  approximately 29.4 percent of all income that Americans will bring in  this year, and that does not even take into account the dozens of other  taxes that Americans pay each year.  At this point, the U.S. tax code is  about <a href="http://www.cnsnews.com/blog/gregory-gwyn-williams-jr/obama-proposes-more-taxes-tax-code-already-13-miles-long" target="_blank" title="13 miles long">13 miles long</a>,  and those that are honest and pay their taxes every year are being  absolutely shredded by this system.  But wouldn’t the federal government  go broke if we didn’t have a federal income tax?  No, actually the  truth is that the federal government did just fine before there was an  income tax.  In fact, the U.S. national debt has gotten <b>more than 5000 times larger</b> since the federal income tax and the Federal Reserve were created by Congress back in 1913.</p>
<p>As I have written about <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/10-things-that-every-american-should-know-about-the-federal-reserve" title="previously">previously</a>,  the Federal Reserve system was actually designed to trap the United  States in a debt spiral from which it could never possibly escape, and  the federal income tax was needed to greatly expand the size of the  federal government and to soak the American people of the funds  necessary to service that debt.  But it doesn’t have to be this way.   America was once much better off before the income tax and the Federal  Reserve were created, and we could easily go to such a system again.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>What we desperately need to do is to teach the American people a  little history lesson.  The truth is that the greatest period of  economic growth in U.S. history was between the Civil War and 1913 when  there was no federal income tax at all.</p>

The following is from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_history_of_the_United_States#The_Gilded_Age:_1865.E2.80.931900" target="_blank" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Gilded Age saw the greatest period of economic growth  in American history. After the short-lived panic of 1873, the economy  recovered with the advent of hard money policies and industrialization.  From 1869 to 1879, the US economy grew at a rate of 6.8% for real GDP  and 4.5% for real GDP per capita, despite the panic of 1873.  The  economy repeated this period of growth in the 1880s, in which the wealth  of the nation grew at an annual rate of 3.8%, while the GDP was also  doubled.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sadly, most Americans cannot even conceive of an economy like that.   Most Americans cannot even imagine having a nation without a massively  bloated federal government and without an unelected central bank  centrally planning our financial system.</p>
<p>But you know what?</p>
<p>It worked.  In fact, it worked fantastically well.</p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>The period between the Civil War and 1913 propelled the United States to greatness.  Just check out all of the good things that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_history_of_the_United_States#The_Gilded_Age:_1865.E2.80.931900" target="_blank" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> says happened for the U.S. economy during those years…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The rapid economic development following the Civil War  laid the groundwork for the modern U.S. industrial economy. By 1890, the  USA leaped ahead of Britain for first place in manufacturing output. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>An explosion of new discoveries and inventions took place, a process  called the “Second Industrial Revolution.” Railroads greatly expanded  the mileage and built stronger tracks and bridges that handled heavier  cars and locomotives, carrying far more goods and people at lower rates.  Refrigeration railroad cars came into use. The telephone, phonograph,  typewriter and electric light were invented. By the dawn of the 20th  century, cars had begun to replace horse-drawn carriages. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Parallel to these achievements was the development of the nation’s  industrial infrastructure. Coal was found in abundance in the  Appalachian Mountains from Pennsylvania south to Kentucky. Oil was  discovered in western Pennsylvania; it was mainly used for lubricants  and for kerosene for lamps. Large iron ore mines opened in the Lake  Superior region of the upper Midwest. Steel mills thrived in places  where these coal and iron ore could be brought together to produce  steel. Large copper and silver mines opened, followed by lead mines and  cement factories. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1913 Henry Ford introduced the assembly line, a step in the process that became known as mass-production.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But if we didn’t have an income tax, how did we fund the government?   Well, we mostly did it with tariffs and excise taxes.  The following is  from a recent article <a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/culture/history/item/14268-before-the-income-tax" target="_blank" title="by Thomas R. Eddlem">by Thomas R. Eddlem</a>…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Prior to ratification of the 16th (income tax) Amendment  in February 1913, the federal government managed its few constitutional  responsibilities without an income tax, except during the Civil War  period. During peacetime, it did so largely — or even entirely — on  import taxes called “tariffs.” Congress could afford to run the federal  government on tariffs alone because federal responsibilities did not  include welfare programs, agricultural subsidies, or social insurance  programs like Social Security or Medicare. After the Civil War, tariff  revenues sometimes suffered under a protectionist policy ushered in by  the Republican Party that supplemented federal income via excises on  alcohol, tobacco, and inheritances. But before the war, the need for  tariff revenue to finance the federal government generally kept the  tariff at reasonable levels. During wartime throughout early American  history, the Founding Fathers were able to raise additional revenue  employing a different method of direct taxation authorized by the U.S.  Constitution prior to the 16th Amendment. These alternative taxing  methods gave the young American nation embarrassing peacetime budget  surpluses that several times came close to paying off the national debt.</p>

<p>Well, early in the 20th century the “progressives” and the social planners started to take control in Washington.</p>
<p>And one of the things that “progressives” and social planners love is an income tax.  In fact, the <a href="http://www.criminalgovernment.com/docs/planks.html" target="_blank" title="second plank">second plank</a> of the Communist Manifesto is a “heavy progressive or graduated income tax”.</p>
<p>Of course they promised us that income tax rates would always remain  low. And at first they were quite low.</p>
<p>The following is from an  article <a href="http://mises.org/daily/1597" target="_blank" title="by Adam Young">by Adam Young</a>…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The presidential election of 1912 was contested between  three advocates of an income tax. The winner, Woodrow Wilson, after the  ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment, called a special session of  Congress in April 1913, which proceeded to pass an income tax of 1% on  incomes above $3,000 and applied surcharges between 2% and 7% on income  from $20,000 to $500,000.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But once the “progressives” and the social planners get their feet in the door, they always want more.</p>
<p>And we have seen how things have worked out.  Today, the American people <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/show-this-to-anyone-that-believes-that-taxes-are-too-low" title="are being taxed into oblivion">are being taxed into oblivion</a>.</p>
<p>In a previous article entitled “<a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/show-this-to-anyone-that-believes-that-taxes-are-too-low" title="Show This To Anyone That Believes That Taxes Are Too Low">Show This To Anyone That Believes That Taxes Are Too Low</a>“, I listed dozens of other taxes that the American people pay each year in addition to federal and state income taxes…</p>

<p>Yet even with all of these taxes, our local governments, our state  governments and our federal government are all absolutely drowning in  debt.</p>
<p>In another previous article entitled “<a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/24-outrageous-facts-about-taxes-in-the-united-states-that-will-blow-your-mind" title="24 Outrageous Facts About Taxes In The United States That Will Blow Your Mind">24 Outrageous Facts About Taxes In The United States That Will Blow Your Mind</a>“,  I listed a number of reasons why our federal income tax system has  become a complete and utter abomination that can never be fixed…</p>
<p><b>1</b> – The U.S. tax code is now <a href="http://www.taxfoundation.org/press/show/28121.html" target="_blank" title="3.8 million">3.8 million</a>  words long.  If you took all of William Shakespeare’s works and  collected them together, the entire collection would only be about  900,000 words long.</p>
<p><b>2</b> – According to the National Taxpayers Union, U.S. taxpayers spend <a href="http://www.ntu.org/news-and-issues/taxes/tax-reform/complexity.html" target="_blank" title="more than 7.6 billion hours">more than 7.6 billion hours</a>  complying with federal tax requirements.  Imagine what our society  would look like if all that time was spent on more economically  profitable activities.</p>
<p><b>3</b> – 75 years ago, the instructions for Form 1040 were two pages long.  Today, they are <a href="http://www.smartmoney.com/taxes/income/10-things-i-hate-about-tax-day-1334094821191/#printMode" target="_blank" title="189 pages">189 pages</a> long.</p>
<p><b>4</b> – There have been <a href="http://www.taxfoundation.org/press/show/28121.html" target="_blank" title="4,428 changes">4,428 changes</a>  to the tax code over the last decade.  It is incredibly costly to  change tax software, tax manuals and tax instruction booklets for all of  those changes.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/expatguide.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 0em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" src="https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/USam150.jpg"></a><b>5</b> – According to the National Taxpayers Union, the IRS currently has <a href="http://www.ntu.org/news-and-issues/taxes/tax-reform/complexity.html" target="_blank" title="1,999">1,999</a> different publications, forms, and instruction sheets that you can download from the IRS website.</p>
<p><b>6</b> – Our tax system has become so complicated that it  is almost impossible to file your taxes correctly.  For example, back  in 1998 Money Magazine had <a href="http://www.ntu.org/news-and-issues/taxes/tax-reform/complexity.html" target="_blank" title="46 different tax professionals">46 different tax professionals</a> complete a tax return for a hypothetical household.  All 46 of them came up with a different result.</p>
<p><b>7</b> – In 2009, PC World had five of the most popular  tax preparation software websites prepare a tax return for a  hypothetical household.  All five of them came up <a href="http://www.ntu.org/news-and-issues/taxes/tax-reform/complexity.html" target="_blank" title="with a different result">with a different result</a>.</p>
<p><b>8</b> – The IRS spends <a href="http://www.9news.com/money/taxes/29093/301/Random-facts-about-taxes-to-ease-what-may-be-a-painful-day" target="_blank" title="$2.45">$2.45</a> for every $100 that it collects in taxes.</p>
<p><b>9</b> – According to The Tax Foundation, the average American has to work <a href="http://www.taxfoundation.org/taxfreedomday/" target="_blank" title="until April 17th">until April 17th</a> just to pay federal, state, and local taxes.  Back in 1900, “Tax Freedom Day” came <a href="http://www.taxfoundation.org/taxfreedomday/" target="_blank" title="on January 22nd">on January 22nd</a>.</p>
<p><b>10</b> – When the U.S. government first implemented a  personal income tax back in 1913, the vast majority of the population  paid a rate of just <a href="http://www.taxfoundation.org/publications/show/151.html" target="_blank" title="1 percent">1 percent</a>, and the highest marginal tax rate was just <a href="http://www.taxfoundation.org/publications/show/151.html" target="_blank" title="7 percent">7 percent</a>.</p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p><b>13</b> – According to Forbes, the 400 highest earning Americans pay an average federal income tax rate <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/robertlenzner/2011/07/25/the-400-richest-americans-pay-an-18-tax-rate/" target="_blank" title="of just 18%">of just 18 percent</a>.</p>
<p><b>14</b> – Warren Buffett had an effective tax rate of just <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/18/us/politics/obama-tax-plan-would-ask-more-of-millionaires.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=1&amp;hp#&amp;wtoeid=growl1_r1_v3" target="_blank" title="17.4 percent">17.4 percent</a> for 2010.</p>
<p><b>15</b> – The top 20 percent of all income earners in the United States pay <a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/apr/18/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-says-top-1-percent-pay-40-percent/" target="_blank" title="approximately 86 percent">approximately 86 percent</a> of all federal income taxes.</p>

<p><b>17</b> – The United States has the highest corporate tax rate in the world (35 percent).  In Ireland, the corporate tax rate <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/03/25/60minutes/main20046867_page3.shtml?tag=contentMain;contentBody" target="_blank" title="is only 12.5 percent">is only 12.5 percent</a>.  This is causing thousands of corporations to move operations out of the United States and into other countries.</p>
<p><b>18</b> – Some tax havens are doing a booming business in  setting up sham headquarters for U.S. corporations.  For example, the  city of Zug, Switzerland only has a population of 26,000 people but it  is the headquarters for <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/03/25/60minutes/main20046867.shtml?tag=currentVideoInfo;segmentTitle" target="_blank" title="30,000 companies">30,000 companies</a>.</p>

<p>The wealthy have become absolute masters at avoiding taxes, and the poor are not able to pay much.<br />
So who always gets squeezed?</p>
<p>The middle class does.</p>
<p>No matter what our politicians promise us, the hammer is always brought down on the middle class.</p>
<p>And now, according to <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/10/irs-email-warrant_n_3055988.html" target="_blank" title="The Huffington Post">The Huffington Post</a>,  the IRS says that it can even read our old emails without a warrant to  make sure that we are paying all of the taxes that we should be…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The IRS apparently interprets that authority very  broadly, the documents show: as long as you’ve stored your email in a  cloud service like Google Mail, and as long as those emails haven’t been  deleted after a few months, the agency thinks it doesn’t need a warrant  to read them. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The idea of IRS agents poking through your email account might sound  at the very least creepy, and maybe unconstitutional. But the IRS does  have a legal leg to stand on: the Electronic Communications Privacy Act  of 1986 allows government agencies to in many cases obtain emails older  than 180 days without a warrant. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That’s why an internal 2009 IRS document <a href="http://www.aclu.org/national-security/manual-transmittal-re-irm-946" target="_hplink" title="claimed">claimed</a>  that “the government may obtain the contents of electronic  communication that has been in storage for more than 180 days” without a  warrant.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It should be noted that the IRS <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/04/12/irs-is-refuting-claims-it-is-snooping-on-americans-by-reading-emails-without/" target="_blank" title="is claiming">is claiming</a>  that it does not use emails “to target” specific taxpayers, but notice  that they are not promising not to use old emails against taxpayers once  they are officially being audited or investigated…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Contrary to some suggestions, the IRS does not use emails to target taxpayers. Any suggestion to the contrary is wrong.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In any event, the truth is that we have one of the most complicated  and one of the most intrusive tax systems in the history of the world.</p>
<p>Don’t the American people deserve better?</p>

<p>Should America go back to a system where there is no income tax and no Federal Reserve?</p>

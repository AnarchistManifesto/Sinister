<p>The BBC has recently surprised everyone with a rare act of journalism, exposing the UK government for funding terrorists in Syria through a foreign aid programme that has dished out millions of pounds of taxpayer money over the years. The money has been awarded to groups like Adam Smith International which is then funneled to the extremists. At the focus of the BBC article is the fact that taxpayer money has been provided to the Free Syrian Police, a police force operated by “rebel” councils.</p>
<p>While ASI argues that the FSP is an unarmed security force, an abundance of evidence demonstrates to the contrary as anyone who pays even a shred of attention to the Syrian crisis would already know. FSP is heavily armed, heavily sectarian, units of terror employed by units of terrorists. They are, in reality, simply more terrorists employed to control and oppress the people of Syria. Of this there is no doubt.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-42217132">As BBC reports</a>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The government has suspended a foreign aid project after a BBC Panorama investigation found taxpayers’ cash was being diverted to extremists in Syria.</p>
<p>Officers from a UK-backed police force in Syria have also been working with courts carrying out brutal sentences.</p>
<p>A UK government spokesman said it takes allegations of co-operation with terrorist groups “extremely seriously”.</p>
<p>Adam Smith International, the British company running the project, said it strongly denies the allegations.</p>
<p>The Free Syrian Police (FSP) was set up following the uprising in Syria, to bring law and order to parts of the country that were controlled by opposition forces.</p>
<p>Adam Smith International (ASI) has been running the project since October 2014.</p>
<p>Britain was one of six donor countries paying for the project, which provides community policing to the rebel-held areas of Aleppo, Idlib and Daraa provinces.</p>
<p>It is intended to be an unarmed civilian police force, and not co-operate with extremist groups, but Panorama has found examples where that was not the case. Some of Panorama’s allegations against the project include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Police cooperating with courts that carry out summary executions – including a case where two women were stoned to death</li>
<li>Police being paid in cash and then being forced to hand over funds to an extremist group controlling the area</li>
<li>Police officers being handpicked by an extremist group</li>
<li>Dead and fictitious people are on the police payroll</li>
</ul>
<p>Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson announced in April that the UK would commit a further £4 million to the UK-funded Access to Justice and Community Security (AJACS) scheme that supports the FSP.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>BBC continues by pointing out the connections between the money provided to FSP as well as the connections between FSP and other terrorist groups like Nour al-Din al-Zinki. The report states,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Panorama has obtained ASI documents that show dead and fictitious people were on the police payroll.</p>
<p>One police station in Koknaya in Idlib province was supposed to be the base for 57 police officers. But the documents show that when ASI’s staff visited in September 2016, they couldn’t find a single officer.</p>
<p>ASI said officers were accounted for on subsequent visits. The company has now suspended the payment of all salaries at the Koknaya police station.</p>
<p>It said it had identified very few examples across Syria where deceased officers had remained on the salary list.</p>
<p>The documents also show how some police officers in Aleppo province were forced to hand over cash to the extremist group – Nour al-Din al-Zinki – in control of the area.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-36843990">The Nour al-Din al-Zinki Movement has been linked to atrocities including the beheading of a young prisoner in 2016.</a></p>
<p>An ASI report from July 2016 warned that 20% of all police salaries were being handed over “to pay for the military and security support that Zinki provides to the five FSP stations located areas under its control”.</p>
<p>As well as handing over a cut of British aid money to Zinki, the police had also worked with a Zinki court “by writing up warrants, delivering notices, and turning criminals over to the court”.<br />
. . . . .</p>
<p>The police cooperation has continued despite allegations of torture and summary executions involving the court at al-Qasimiyeh.</p>
<p>Tory MP Crispin Blunt, former chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee, said the FSP should not be supporting extremist courts.</p>
<p>He said: “You’ve got people being sentenced to death for homosexuality.</p>
<p>“Clearly that is completely and utterly unacceptable by any standard and the idea that British taxpayers’ money was associated with that would of course be wholly abhorrent.”<br />
. . . . .</p>
<p>Panorama also discovered that the Free Syrian Police provided support for courts run by the Syrian branch of al-Qaeda – Jabhat al-Nusra – which handed out extreme punishments.</p>
<p>Police officers were present when two women were stoned to death near Sarmin in December 2014. Sources have told Panorama the officers closed the road so that the execution could take place.</p>
<p>ASI says the police officers who attended the stoning were not formally under FSP control and have since been removed.</p>
<p>Panorama has also seen evidence that al-Nusra handpicked police officers in two stations in Idlib province.</p>
<p>ASI says that the officers imposed by al-Nusra were detected in under two months and that payments to the station were then stopped.</p>

<p>To be clear, the report of the UK funding of the terrorist Free Syrian Police was work that was already done in January of 2017 by Vanessa Beeley of 21st Century Wire. Her article, “<a href="http://21stcenturywire.com/2017/01/30/the-free-syrian-police-made-in-the-uk-vanessa-beeley-on-uk-column/">The ‘Free Syrian Police’ Made In The UK – Vanessa Beeley Exposes West’s Shadow State Project,</a>” contained an interview with Mike Robinson and Brian Gerrish of UK Column regarding the FSP founders and the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-turkey-police-idUSKBN1582MF">media moves</a> to highlight the role of the FSP in the Nusra Front, ISIS, and other terrorist-occupied, region of Idlib. Still, better late than never, BBC.</p>
<p>However, there is much more to the story than what is being covered by the BBC. Nowhere in the BBC Panorama report is there anything incriminating the White Helmets and their own connections to the Free Syrian Police, the blatant connections of these groups to terrorists (i.e. terrorist leaders of White Helmets, FSP, etc.), recent or current atrocities committed by FSP and White Helmets, or the muddied waters of terrorist groups’ name changes so that it is more difficult to pinpoint in general terms Western support for terrorism in Syria. Thus, what BBC is doing cannot be called investigative journalism (since the investigation and the journalism was already done nearly a year ago), it is a whitewash designed to conceal the nature of the UK’s true involvement in the war on Syria, it’s funding and support of terrorism, and the reality that the White Helmets themselves are nothing more than terrorists.</p>
<div class="alignright">

</div>
</div>
<p>Although the United States has been the most upfront supporter of terrorism over the last six years, the UK has followed suit, albeit quietly. The UK’s financial involvement in the war against Syria centers itself in the Conflict Stability and Security Fund (CSSF), formerly known as the Conflict Pool. According the organization, “The Conflict, Stability and Security Fund (CSSF) provides development and security support to countries which are at risk of conflict or instability. It’s the only government fund which uses both Defence spend and Official Development Assistance (ODA) to deliver and support security, defence, peacekeeping, peace-building and stability activity.”</p>
<p>In reality, the CSSF is a slush fund that is used as an ever-ready pool of resources to be dumped into conflict zones or areas that are to be turned into conflict zones by Western destabilization tactics.</p>
<p>The CSSF’s own website states that it has been allocated 1.163 billion British pounds for 2017-2018 alone by the British government. That is 1.163 billion pounds of British taxpayer money allocated for terrorists in Syria while Britain sinks even further into economic depression, third world living standards, and cultural collapse. Still, despite the public admission of CSSF regarding the amount of money it has been allocated by the government, the organization has been rather secretive when it comes to Syria. A recent Parliamentary Question from Baroness Caroline Cox has revealed that the UK FCO has financed terrorists in Syria for at least three years through the CSSF.</p>
<p>Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon, FCO stated, “The value of the CSSF for Syria is £69 million in the current financial year, was £64 million in 2016-17, and £66 million in 2015-16.”</p>
<p>The UK government has placed almost 200 million pounds into the terrorists proxies in Syria but, despite this knowledge being public, the government will not release the names of the recipients of those funds.</p>
<p>This fund, through ASI and Integrity Global, provided money directly and indirectly to terrorists operating in Syria, particularly in places like East Aleppo via the FSP, White Helmets, and “local councils,” themselves all different faces of the terrorist apparatus known as al-Nusra Front. Vanessa Beeley has detailed in her article, “<a href="http://21stcenturywire.com/2017/12/02/white-helmets-local-councils-uk-fco-financing-terrorism-syria-taxpayer-funds/">White Helmets and ‘Local Councils’ – Is The UK FCO Financing Terrorism In Syria With Taxpayer Funds,”</a> the trail of money coming from the UK government via ASI and Integrity Global and finding its way to the terrorists of al-Nusra. I highly encourage the reader to access and read the article in its entirety.</p>
<p>During the questioning of Lord Bates, British officials admitted clearly that the British government was indeed funding the Local Councils, not just the police forces. As Vanessa Beeley writes in her article,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With reference to the UK FCO funding of what are clearly terrorist controlled “opposition” groups, the most recent questions, tabled by Baroness Cox in October 2017, have asked whether the UK Govt can be sure that funds are not going to proscribed organisations with past or present links to Al Qaeda or associated extremist groups in East Aleppo and Idlib, via Tamkeen:</p>
<p>1. With reference to Lord Ahmed’s answer of 20 September (HL 1252) will the government clarify the role of Tamkeen in delivering UK support for moderates in Syria; in particular will the government make clear which local councils are receiving UK assistance through Tamkeen, and will they state whether individuals associated with proscribed organisations, notably those with links past or present to Al Qaida, are members of those councils or have been members during the periods in which the councils have received assistance?</p>
<p>Answer: “The “Support to Emerging Local Governance in Syria (Tamkeen)” programme, which ended in 2016, and its successor, the “Strengthening Governance Structures (Tatweer)” programme, support Provincial and Local Councils in Syria by helping them to provide open and accountable local governance and services. Tatweer operates in 16 Syrian Local Councils identified as needing immediate basic services support across Idlib, Aleppo, Daraa and Rif Damascus governorates. DFID has extensive controls in place to ensure that UK aid reaches those who need it and that it does not benefit extremists or terror groups, including vetting processes to ensure such groups are not part of the Councils with which we work. We actively manage the risks of operating in Syria. We stop funding to any project or sub-project where we have any concern that it could benefit proscribed groups.” ~ <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/lords/lord-bates/1091">Lord Bates</a></p>
<p>2. With reference to Lord Ahmad’s answer of 20 September (HL1252) will the government clarify whether the assistance they have channelled through Tamkeen has been spent in areas of Northern Syria presently under the control of Hayat Tahrir Al Sham (the jihadi coalition led by the organisation which changed its name from Al Nusra), and the jihadi group Ahrar Al Sham, and whether that assistance continues to be made available to those areas?</p>
<p>Answer: “Tamkeen and Tatweer, its successor programme, provide support to improve the capacity and processes of Provincial and Local Councils in northern Syria. DFID has extensive controls in place to ensure that UK aid reaches those who need it and that it does not benefit extremists or terror groups, such as Hayat Tahrir Al Sham, including vetting processes to ensure such groups are not part of the councils with which we work. We actively manage the risks of operating in Syria. We stop funding to any project or sub-project where we have any concern that it could benefit proscribed groups.” ~<a href="http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/lords/lord-bates/1091"> Lord Bates</a></p>

<p>Beeley, who traveled to Syria and East Aleppo specifically during 2016 and 2017, recounts what she found alongside Syrian journalist Khaled Iskef, demonstrating a clear link between the British organizations and the terrorist “opposition” in Syria . She writes,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>During my time in East Aleppo in 2016/17 with Syrian journalist, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/khalediskef">Khaled Iskef</a>, we translated documents (in Arabic) found by Iskef, that referred to two UK organisations, <a href="https://www.adamsmithinternational.com/">Adam Smith International</a> (ASI) and <a href="https://www.integrityglobal.com/">Integrity Global</a> in connection with the funding of Syrian “opposition” structures in East Aleppo. Translation of one document reveals that, in May 2014, the DFID (Department for International Development) was involved in the funding of a Local Council initiative via ASI and Integrity:</p>
<p>“The program, which is funded by the Department for International Development (DFID) will be aimed at local structures that indicate responsibility, transparency, and respect for human rights and strengthens their capacity to provide local services to communities. Adam Smith and Integrity will provide technical assistance through local consultancy teams, as well as technical and financial resources to meet the most urgent needs. This program is currently working in 10 excellent communities and is expected to increase the assistance to 40 communities.” ~ Taken from the document.</p>

<p>These documents [photos of the documents <a href="http://21stcenturywire.com/2017/12/02/white-helmets-local-councils-uk-fco-financing-terrorism-syria-taxpayer-funds/">included in Beeley’s article</a>] were found among the debris of the various Nusra Front (Al Qaeda in Syria) centres, East Aleppo Council buildings and <a href="http://www.mintpressnews.com/investigation-white-helmets-committing-acts-terror-across-syria/231597/">White Helmet</a> centres. It is noteworthy that these three entities operating in what was terrorist occupied East Aleppo until December 2016, always worked alongside one another, either sharing facilities and buildings or next door to one another in the various districts of East Aleppo where they centered their activities.</p>
<p>The CSSF came into being on the 1st April 2015 and both Adam Smith International and Integrity Global were added to the “<a href="http://ted.europa.eu/TED/notice/udl?uri=TED:NOTICE:436193-2015:TEXT:EN:HTML">list of suppliers awarded a place</a> on the conflict, stability and security fund framework“. ASI and Integrity are <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/648656/Spend_Over_25k_July_2017.csv/preview">funded by the UK FCO via the CSSF</a> to offer “assistance” to the Syrian “opposition” and this has been achieved via a variety of outreach agents, one of which is the <a href="http://www.project-tamkeen.org/">Tamkeen Project,</a> which claims to “build resilience in Syrian communities” and which establishes, funds and supports the “local councils” in terrorist held areas such as East Aleppo and Idlib. Appropriately, <a href="https://www.adamsmithinternational.com/explore-our-work/middle-east-north-africa/syria/building-the-capacity-for-governance-in-communities-across-opposition-contr/">Tamkeen</a> means “empowerment” in Arabic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Beeley then cites a video which was filmed in the al Sha’ar district of East Aleppo in July, 2017, showing a Tamkeen-funded East Aleppo Council building standing across from a former garage that was commandeered by Nusra Front (aka al-Qaeda) for use as a bomb factory.</p>
<p>The video <a href="http://21stcenturywire.com/2017/12/02/white-helmets-local-councils-uk-fco-financing-terrorism-syria-taxpayer-funds/">can be seen here</a></p>
<p>[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ43WyAOaJ0?feature=oembed&#038;w=777&#038;h=437]</p>
<p>Beeley then continues,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This image (<a href="http://21stcenturywire.com/2017/12/02/white-helmets-local-councils-uk-fco-financing-terrorism-syria-taxpayer-funds/">found in Beeley’s article</a>) shows the black powder that Nusra Front used to pack inside shells &amp; gas canisters, similar to what is used inside <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/tungsten-bombs-leave-israels-victims-with-mystery-wounds-1418910.html">DIME or “Tungsten” bombs</a> deployed against Gaza by Israel in 2012 and 2014. These missiles would release the metal nano-particles on explosion and the particles are transferred from the wounds to the internal organs of the victims, causing inoperable damage and eventual septicemia from which there is usually no recovery.</p>
<p>These deadly missiles were used on a regular basis against the 1.5 million Syrian civilians in the Syrian Government-protected West Aleppo during the terrorist &amp; extremist occupation of East Aleppo. According to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SAJm4VRaXA&amp;t=81s">civilian testimony</a>, after the liberation of East Aleppo, these missiles were also used against civilians in the occupied districts by the terrorist factions who then blamed such attacks on the advancing Syrian Arab Army.</p>
<p>The Tamkeen Project birthed and then nurtured the “Local Councils,” operating in what was terrorist-occupied East Aleppo. According to Brita Haji Hassan, the self-proclaimed “mayor of Aleppo” 2016, in an interview with the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/may/08/gazientep-turkey-tamkeen-quest-to-rebuild-syria">Guardian</a>, the programme provided (East) Aleppo city council with £ 820,000 (May 2016).</p>
<p>While Hassan took great pains to describe his assumed “municipality” as “liberated Aleppo”, he naturally avoided mentioning the Nusra Front dominated terrorist presence that was committing atrocities against the Syrian civilians who dared to resist their occupiers’ extremist ideology or brutal oppression. Hassan tried to reinforce the myth that very few Nusra Front fighters remained in East Aleppo in December 2016 and that they were outnumbered by the “moderates” who had elected Hassan to his post as their representative. A representative of the associated “<a href="https://fr.sputniknews.com/points_de_vue/201612071029060259-alep-paris-syrie-france/">democratic institutions</a>“.</p>
<p>Democratic institutions… such as the Sharia court in the Qadi Alasker district Eye &amp; Childrens Hospital compound that had been occupied by ISIS until January 2014, then by Nusra Front in coordination with the Al Shameya Front &amp; other extremist brigades. The following interview with Ahmad Aldayh was conducted in May 2017. Aldayh had been imprisoned in this particular “democratic institution”.</p>
<p>“The terrorists arrested a guy, the only child of his family. They arrested him because they found a picture of one of his friends carrying the Syrian flag, on his mobile phone. The terrorists tortured him for three hours, then they executed him.”</p>

<p><a href="http://21stcenturywire.com/2016/06/15/syria-aleppo-doctor-demolishes-imperialist-propaganda-and-media-warmongering/">Dr Nabil Antaki</a>, an eminent gastroenterologist from Aleppo <a href="http://arretsurinfo.ch/nabil-antaki-le-maire-dalep-est-sorti-du-chapeau-des-magiciens/">had this to say</a> about Hassan’s delusions of grandeur:</p>
<p>“Returning to the subject of this pseudo-mayor, Brita Hagi Hassan, I can assure you, he is mayor of nothing. Nobody in Aleppo had ever heard of him before he was magicked out of nowhere by the West. […] I ask all my friends in the West, please don’t believe your media &amp; government lies and I have one message for the media: Enough! Stop lying!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Moving back to the question of Adam Smith International, it is important to note that BBC reports the latest scandal as if it were the only one ASI has been involved in. However, in March, 2017, ASI’s founders were forced out when the UK government allegedly froze future contracts over questions about the ethical integrity of the company. The integrity questions surrounded evidence that ASI was profiteering off by exploiting leaked department DfID documents. The company was also criticized for attempting to “unduly influence” a parliamentary inquiry by manufacturing “letters of appreciation” from “beneficiaries” of ASI’s projects.</p>
<p>After all the press and furor had died down, it became clear enough that the freezing of assets and complaints of the UK government was merely theatre. At least by August, 2017 UK FCO was issuing payments to ASI yet again.</p>
<p><a href="http://21stcenturywire.com/2017/12/02/white-helmets-local-councils-uk-fco-financing-terrorism-syria-taxpayer-funds/">Beeley writes</a>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Perhaps rather naively, one might assume that the scandal that had affected DFID would be transferred over to the UK FCO CSSF managers. A quick look at the UK FCO spend ‘over £25,000’ for 2017 certainly shows continued payments being made to ASI, including in the updated entry on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-office-spend-over-25000-for-2017">29th September 2017</a>.</p>
<p>In fact, in the month of August 2017 alone, ASI received £ 3.79m from the UK FCO. It appears that the FCO is happy to be using a questionable &amp; corrupt conduit to transfer funds that will almost certainly make their way into the hands of internationally proclaimed terrorist groups and their affiliates, this time in Syria.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>The “Local Councils”</b></p>
<p>Beeley then turns to the nature of the “local councils” operating in Syria and funding by the UK, particularly one known as the Command Council in terrorist-held East Aleppo. She writes,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Aleppo Command Council, a unification of all eastern district “councils,” was set up in mid-November, as the fierce battles for the liberation of East Aleppo from western backed terrorist factions were drawing to a close. The Syrian Arab Army (SAA) allied advance was tightening the noose around the final terrorist enclaves that included the Old City of Aleppo and the Omayyed Mosque, where these photos were taken. So the last stand by the Tamkeen established, UK FCO financed, Local Council was reaching its finale.</p>
<p>A study of the photo &amp; the nature of its subjects might give a few clues as to the terrorist affiliations of these Council members but one individual in particular stands out, Omar Salkho. Salkho (image linked in article) was a member of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/20/syrian-opposition-group-which-killed-child-was-in-us-vetted-alliance">US backed</a> “moderate” extremist group, Harakat Nour al Din Zenki &amp; is seated in the centre of the photograph. This group’s notoriety rose to prominence after they publicly tortured and beheaded Palestinian child, <a href="http://21stcenturywire.com/2017/01/28/child-beheading-terrorist-supporter-wins-getty-and-sunday-times-defining-images-award-2016/">Abdullah Issa</a> in July 2016.</p>
<p>Did the UK FCO ‘overlook’ the terrorist activities and affiliations of the Local Councils they were financing by proxy just as they had overlooked the criminal fraud and seedy double-dealing conducted by ASI?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But Omar Salkho was not simply an exception or, as former State Department Spokesman Mark Toner put it, “one incident here and there.” Local Council affiliation with terrorists and terrorists holding positions within those councils were quite common. As Beeley writes,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In December 2013 a militant fighter, Abdulaziz Maghrabi (seen above) was <a href="http://en.etilaf.org/daily-newsletter/daily-newsletter-16-12-2013.html">elected President of the East Aleppo Council.</a> At that time, aforementioned Hagi Hassan was his deputy. In an <a href="https://www.alaraby.co.uk/society/2014/9/8/%D9%87%D9%83%D8%B0%D8%A7-%D8%A3%D8%B3%D8%B3-%D8%A3%D8%A8%D9%88-%D8%B3%D9%84%D9%85%D9%89-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%B9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%AF%D9%86%D9%8A-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%AD%D9%84%D8%A8">Al Araby article</a> that focused on Maghrabi, he informed them that he had been with the Muslim Brotherhood-Qatari-backed <a href="https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/security/2013/10/syria-opposition-islamists-tawhid-brigade.html">Al Tawhid Islamist </a>brigades when East Aleppo was first invaded in 2012. He was then elected to the presidency of the East Aleppo Council AND he formed the “civil defence” aka the <a href="http://www.mintpressnews.com/investigation-white-helmets-committing-acts-terror-across-syria/231597/">White Helmets</a> in East Aleppo in 2013, with the backing of the international sponsors &amp; creators of this hybrid, pseudo first-responder organisation.</p>
<p>In the second photo [<a href="http://21stcenturywire.com/2017/12/02/white-helmets-local-councils-uk-fco-financing-terrorism-syria-taxpayer-funds/">available here</a>] (November 2016) we see Maghrabi with hardline extremist group <a href="https://yallasouriya.wordpress.com/2016/11/20/syriaaleppoabu-amara-battalions-torture-technics-against-fastqem-union-members-a-reminder-of-the-regime-torture-chamber/">Abu Amara.</a> Abu Amara acted as the most brutal security agency in East Aleppo, even outdoing Nusra Front in the atrocities committed against Syrian civilians under their occuptation. In the first photo with Ahrar Al Sham, Maghrabi is wearing a shirt with the Abu Amara logo, demonstrating the close working relationship between these two terrorist organisations. According to civilian testimony in East Aleppo – Nusra Front, Abu Amara, Ahrar Al Sham &amp; other factions formed a tightly integrated group of terrorist brigades.</p>
<p>According to a report in <a href="https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/security/2013/10/syria-opposition-islamists-tawhid-brigade.html">Al Monitor</a>, al-Tawhid Brigade’s military commander, Abdul Qadir al-Saleh, made the following statement in 2013:</p>
<p>“Saleh recently praised <a href="http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/security/2013/10/syria-damascus-mujahideen-jihadists.html">Jabhat al-Nusra</a> and “the high coordination between them and the rest of the factions fighting on the ground. … [There is] great coordination with them on the military side.” That was not the first time he made such a statement. In April, he expressed his “complete rejection to include Jabhat al-Nusra on the US terrorism list,” adding that the group didn’t engage in terrorism.”</p>
<p>When I spoke to crew members of the former East Aleppo <a href="http://21stcenturywire.com/2016/09/23/exclusive-the-real-syria-civil-defence-expose-natos-white-helmets-as-terrorist-linked-imposters/">REAL Syria Civil Defence</a> who had been expelled from East Aleppo by the militant groups, they told me these groups had taken over the East Aleppo centres in 2012-2013, killing many crew members, kidnapping others and stealing their equipment. One crew member told me they had tried to force him to stay and work with them, but he succeeded in escaping to the secure, terrorist-free West Aleppo which remained under Syrian government protection throughout the Nusra Front-led occupation of East Aleppo until December 2016. In his haste, he had been forced to leave his teenage sons behind in East Aleppo.</p>
<p>White Helmets and terrorist factions had marked him for assassination should he try to re-enter East Aleppo via any of the terrorist checkpoints. Other crew members told me how they &amp; their families now working &amp; living in West Aleppo had been deliberately targeted by militant factions in East Aleppo, even during rescue missions.</p>
<p>Maghrabi (better known as Abu Salma) did not relinquish his terrorist connections at any point. He remained an active member of Abu Amara &amp; Nusra Front according to testimony from Syrian civilians &amp; ex-fighters in East Aleppo who resumed normal life in Aleppo after the final evacuation of terrorist factions in December 2016. Maghrabi has regularly been photographed with Ahrar Al Sham, Abu Amara and at demonstrations with Nusra Front militants.</p>
<p>In this photo, Maghrabi is seen being interviewed by Halab Today TV, during an East Aleppo, Nusra Front demonstration in September 2014 (Nusra Front black flag can be seen in the background):</p>
<p>Maghrabi posted the following video to his <a href="https://www.facebook.com/abo.salmaaaaa/videos/vb.100009838638884/491137091224241/?type=2&amp;video_source=user_video_tab">Facebook page</a> in August 2017, paying tribute to the Abu Amara militants in the video – “A year ago, with one of the good guys before the launch of the Ramousie battle”. Abu Amara were preparing the campaign to prevent the SAA and allies retaking the Castello Road, an arterial humanitarian supply line for Aleppo civilians and an essential weapons entry point for the terrorist groups occupying East Aleppo:</p>
<p>While the US and UK have steadfastly refused to designate Ahar Al Sham a terrorist organisation, it is worth noting that in <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/361866-germany-convicted-aiding-ahrar-terrorists/">October 2016</a>, “a German court convicted four supporters of hardline Islamist group Ahrar Al-Sham, who supplied munitions and equipment worth thousands of dollars to Syria, of aiding terrorism. It may serve a precedent for further trials.” This landmark decision marked Ahrar Al Sham as an atrocity-committing, international terrorist group operating in Syria:</p>
<p>“Describing the radical group as “a foreign terrorist organization” that seeks to portray itself as a member of the so-called moderate opposition in Syria, the court cited the group’s public acknowledgments of mounting suicide attacks and preparing assaults on Alawite villages.” ~ <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/361866-germany-convicted-aiding-ahrar-terrorists/">Aiding Terrorist Groups</a></p>
<p>Ahrar Al Sham are also included in the Jaish al Fatah (Army of Conquest) alongside Nusra Front. This terrorist “Army” is led by child-suicide-bomber-trainer, Riyadh educated <a href="http://www.joshualandis.com/blog/abdallah-al-muhaysini-a-pivotal-figure-in-the-islamist-insurgency-in-syria-by-%EF%BB%BFwaleed-rikab/">Sheikh Abdullah Muhaysini</a>. The following excerpt is taken from a <a href="https://vimeo.com/239554172">video filmed</a> in the Hama countryside earlier this year, featuring Fatah Al Sham fighters, White Helmets and Muhaysini welcoming terrorists from Daraya. Watch:</p>
<p>[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fJbMWhkTAw?feature=oembed&#038;w=777&#038;h=437]</p>
<p>Maghrabi was therefore, undeniably, a terrorist at the same time as he was both president of the UK FCO financed East Aleppo Council &amp; the founder of the White Helmets in East Aleppo who are also financed by the UK FCO, via the infamous CSSF, among a number of other international sponsors which include the US, via USAID &amp; Chemonics, Qatar, Holland, France, Germany, Japan, Denmark, Canada. Those offering logistics support or training to the White Helmets include New Zealand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>The White Helmets – East Aleppo Council Connection</b></p>
<p>Beeley then turns to another aspect which the BBC report conveniently remained silent on – the connection between the terrorist East Aleppo Council (which BBC attempted to portray as unfortunately corrupted by some jihadists who had slipped into its midst) and the White Helmets. She writes,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The close connection between East Aleppo Council and the White Helmets are demonstrated by:</p>
<p>1. They are both funded by the UK FCO CSSF (among other sponsors) via various intermediaries. For the White Helmets, it is <a href="http://www.mintpressnews.com/investigation-white-helmets-committing-acts-terror-across-syria/231597/">Mayday Rescue</a> that acts as the primary laundering agent for UK FCO funds.</p>
<p>2. Their operating centres in East Aleppo were always next door to each other and alongside Nusra Front military centres – and also alongside UK FCO funded “Free Syrian Police.”</p>

</div>
<p>3. The White Helmet group in East Aleppo was established by the president of the East Aleppo Council (EAC), Maghrabi, who has clear affiliations to terrorist groups inside Syria. Maghrabi is also an active militant member of those groups, by his own admission.</p>
<p>4. White Helmets in East Aleppo, Idlib and other terrorist occupied areas of Syria have consistently and unreservedly proclaimed allegiance to terrorists groups such as Ahrar Al Sham and Nusra Front on their social media accounts. A recent survey carried out by the <a href="http://syrianwar1.blogspot.fr/2017/11/white-helmets-exposed-as-extremists-65.html">Syrian War Blog </a>has identified 65 White Helmet operatives who have professed their membership of, or alliance with, extremist groups. This survey analysed more than 200 digital media accounts belonging to individual White Helmets and the investigation is ongoing. The 65 accounts that have been highlighted are the most extreme, but all other accounts also displayed extremist tendencies.</p>
<p>5. The East Aleppo Council logo was seen on the sleeve of White Helmet jackets left behind in the abandoned White Helmet centres in various districts of East Aleppo. The White Helmets were evacuated from East Aleppo in December 2016 alongside the Nusra Front-led militant and extremist factions. Photo below shows White Helmet, Ismail Alabdullah, wearing the White Helmet uniform with the East Aleppo Council logo on the left sleeve of the jacket. (Photo: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=895113020512197&amp;set=ecnf.100000405234798&amp;type=3&amp;theater">Alabdullah’s Facebook page</a>)</p>
<p>6: In the following infograph (linked in Beeley’s article) you will see that Hagi Hassan had replaced Maghrabi as president of the EAC by 2016. Hassan accompanied overall leader of the White Helmets, <a href="http://21stcenturywire.com/2016/12/10/exclusive-president-raed-salehs-terrorist-connections-within-white-helmet-leadership/">Raed Saleh</a> (upper left-hand corner of infograph), to Paris in October 2016, where they were both welcomed by former French president, Francois Hollande and <a href="http://www.gettyimages.fr/detail/photo-d">given access to the Assemblee Nationale</a>. The East Aleppo “Local Council” working hand in hand with the White Helmets and terrorist groups in Syria, while lobbying for military escalation or faux-humanitarian intervention from the US coaliton, in this case, France.</p>
<p>A little further evidence of the UK FCO close working relationship with the Tamkeen Project can be demonstrated by UK FCO’s Special Representative for Syria (based in Turkey) Gareth Bayley and his letter to the Tamkeen team, regarding the loss of their leader, Ayman Sheikha during battles for East Aleppo in November 2016.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Bayley never expressed such personal concern or condolences for the 11,000 plus civilians murdered in West Aleppo by the hell cannon gas canister missiles, mortars, grad rockets, explosive bullets, chemical weapon attacks, snipers, suicide bombers emanating from terrorist controlled East Aleppo during the 5 year siege by the very organisations the UK FCO had been financing during that time. The majority of Syrian civilians maimed or killed in West Aleppo were children.</p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p>While the UK government continues to claim that it does not fund extremists in Syria, the fact is that all “rebel” groups are nothing more than different presentations of the same terrorist proxy force funded and directed by the West, GCC, and Israel for the purpose of overthrowing the secular government of Bashar al-Assad. As this article, the <a href="http://21stcenturywire.com/2017/12/02/white-helmets-local-councils-uk-fco-financing-terrorism-syria-taxpayer-funds/">work of Vanessa Beeley</a>, and even the whitewash of the BCC demonstrates, the UK government is clearly funding terrorists to the hilt in Syria, despite the fact that the United States is the most vocal supporter of terrorism today. The UK government, via its FCO and FCO subsidiaries have documented their own support for terrorists via the money provided to the White Helmets, Free Syrian Police, and Local Councils of terrorist-held areas. These latest revelations only serve to confirm what independent journalists like Iskef and Beeley confirmed nearly a year prior. However, there is much more money and much deeper connections between the British government and terrorism in Syria than the BBC whitewash report was allowed to produce. Aside from funding, the UK has deployed intelligence agents and <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2013/08/western-special-forces-working-with.html">SAS forces inside</a> Syria <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2016/08/photos-confirm-u-k-special-forces-protecting-terrorists-in-syria.html">for the purpose</a> of backing up and protecting terrorists against the Syrian government.</p>

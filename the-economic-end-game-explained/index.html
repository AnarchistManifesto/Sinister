<a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2014/11/the-economic-end-game-explained.html"><b>Activist Post </b></a></p>
<p>Throughout history, in most cases of economic collapse the societies   in question believed they were financially invincible just before their   disastrous fall. Rarely does anyone see the edge of the cliff or even   the bottom of the abyss before it has swallowed a nation whole. This   lack of foresight, however, is not entirely the fault of the public. It   is, rather, a consequence caused by the manipulation of the fundamental   information available to the public by governments and social   gatekeepers.</p>
<p>In the years leading up to the Great Depression,  numerous mainstream  “experts” and politicians were quick to discount the  idea of economic  collapse, and most people were more than ready to  believe them.  Equities markets were, of course, the primary tool used to  falsely  elicit popular optimism. When markets rose, even in spite of  other very  negative fiscal indicators, the masses were satisfied.</p>
<p>In  this way,  stock markets have become a kind of dopamine switch financial  elites  can push at any given time to juice the citizenry and distract  them  from the greater perils of their economic future. During every  upswing  of stocks, the elites argued that the “corner had been turned,”  when in  reality the crisis had just begun. Nothing has changed since the  crash  of 1929. Just look at some of these quotes and decide if the  rhetoric  sounds familiar today:</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>John Maynard Keynes in 1927: <b>“We will not have any more crashes in our time.”</b></p>
<p>H.H. Simmons, president of the New York Stock Exchange, Jan. 12, 1928: <b>“I  cannot help but raise a dissenting voice to statements that we are  living in a fool’s paradise, and that prosperity in this country must  necessarily diminish and recede in the near future.” </b></p>
<div align="left">
<ins class="adsbygoogle" style="height: 60px;margin-bottom: 1.5em;width: 468px"></ins></p>
<p>    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || ).push({});
</p></div>
<p>Irving Fisher, leading U.S. economist, The New York Times, Sept. 5, 1929: <b>“There may be a recession in stock prices, but not anything in the nature of a crash.” </b>And on 17, 1929:<b>  “Stock prices have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau. I  do not feel there will be soon if ever a 50 or 60 point break from  present levels, such as (bears) have predicted. I expect to see the  stock market a good deal higher within a few months.”</b></p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>W. McNeel, market analyst, as quoted in the New York Herald Tribune, Oct. 30, 1929: <b>“This  is the time to buy stocks. This is the time to recall the words of the  late J. P. Morgan… that any man who is bearish on America will go broke.  Within a few days there is likely to be a bear panic rather than a bull  panic. Many of the low prices as a result of this hysterical selling  are not likely to be reached again in many years.”</b></p>
<p>Harvard Economic Society, Nov. 10, 1929: <b>“… a serious depression seems improbable; [we expect] recovery of business next spring, with further improvement in the fall.” </b></p>
<p>I hear nearly identical statements from pro-mainstream, pro-dollar   skeptics all the time. And all of their assertions rest solely on the   illusion of the Dow and the dollar index, not to mention statistics that   are sourced from the very government that has much to gain by fooling   the public into believing all is well.</p>
<p>In 2009, Paul Krugman,  perhaps the worst and most famous economist of our age, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/06/magazine/06Economic-t.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0">lamented on the  fact</a>  that no one in mainstream finance saw the derivatives and credit  crash  coming. Yet it is the same kinds of manipulative policies that  Krugman  champions that caused this collective ignorance in mainstream  circles  to begin with.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/bitcoinalliance.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 0em;margin-left: 1em"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-R-BW9d-Hz18/VCCMcfUMGfI/AAAAAAAAAyk/3ghKQnodTiU/s180/180x1502c203fd2-f422-49cb-8fc5-f7717bd5975a.jpg"></a>What the past proves, time and time again, is that establishment  trained and educated economists are perhaps the most useless  of all  analysts. They are perpetually wrong. Only independent analysts  have  ever been able to predict anything of value as far as our economic   future — not because they are psychic, but because they have the   advantage of standing outside the foggy propaganda of brainwashed  financial  academia.</p>
<p>It also proves that the appearance of prosperity means  nothing if  the fundamentals do not support the optimism. That is to say,  a bullish  stock market, a high dollar index and a low unemployment  percentage  mean nothing if such stats are generated by false methods and fiat.  The  fundamentals ALWAYS matter.  As we saw during the Great Depression, the  markets cannot hide from reality forever.</p>
<p>I  relate these points because the future I am about to suggest here  might  sound outlandish to some, because it is so contrary to the   “official” accounting of our current financial world. It is important to  remember  that the mainstream, the majority, is almost always wrong and  that the truth is very rarely accepted broadly until calamity has  already fallen.</p>
<p>I outlined the hard facts behind the reality of economic downturn in my article <a href="http://www.alt-market.com/articles/2394-we-have-just-witnessed-the-last-gasp-of-the-global-economy">“We Have Just Witnessed The Last Gasp Of The Global Economy.” </a></p>
<p>The  bottom line is that the stock market, the greatest false  indicator of  all time, is on the verge of implosion; and the banking  elites are  positioning themselves to avoid blame for this implosion  while the rest  of us are being sold on the most elaborate recovery  con-game ever  conceived. But what is the purpose behind this con-game?  Lies are  generally only told by those who hope to gain something  through  deception. What do the elites hope to gain by creating a facade  of  recovery?</p>
<p>They have openly admitted to the public on numerous occasions EXACTLY   what they want — namely, the institution of a truly global and   centralized economic system revolving around a highly controlled world   currency framework and dominated by a select cult of banking oligarchs.   Anyone who claims that this is not the goal is either a liar or an   uneducated fool.</p>
<p>I have covered the evidence supporting this program many times in   the past, but it would seem with the precariously surreal nature of our  world  today that much needs repeating. In 1988, the financial magazine <i>The  Economist</i> published an article titled <a href="http://socioecohistory.wordpress.com/2014/07/26/flashback-1988-get-ready-for-a-world-currency-by-2018%E2%80%B3-the-economist-magazine/">“Get ready for a world currency by  2018,”</a>  in which it outlined the framework for a global currency system  called  the “Phoenix” (a hypothetical title), administered by the   International Monetary Fund by the year 2018, which would erase all   national economic sovereignty and require governments to borrow from the   world central banking authority, rather than print, in order to  finance their  infrastructure programs. This would mean total control by  the IMF over  member nations as they beg and plead for more capital  under the global  currency umbrella.</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both;text-align: center"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OdMr1gJzTgo/VGNnxhcaZOI/AAAAAAAAhxY/IGpNyrjFMpc/s1600/ecocover.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em;margin-right: 1em"><img border="0" height="640" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OdMr1gJzTgo/VGNnxhcaZOI/AAAAAAAAhxY/IGpNyrjFMpc/s640/ecocover.jpg" width="466"></a></div>
<p>
If this sounds familiar, it is because I have  been warning about the  IMF takeover of the global monetary system for at  least six years. <i>The  Economist</i> actually admits that the Phoenix system  would start out in  the format of the Special Drawing Rights basket  currency:<b> </b></p>
<p><b>The phoenix would probably start as a  cocktail of  national currencies, just as the Special Drawing Right is  today. In  time, though, its value against national currencies would  cease to  matter, because people would choose it for its convenience and  the  stability of its purchasing power…</b></p>
<p>The plan is to introduce a basket currency system as an alternative  to the dollar as world reserve, then slowly but surly phase out all  sovereign currencies until the basket becomes a currency itself – the  ONLY currency.  Former World Bank Chief Economist Justin Yifu Lin <a href="http://africa.chinadaily.com.cn/weekly/2014-01/31/content_17266594.htm">seems to agree</a>  with this ideology, arguing that national currencies must be replaced  with a supranational currency, and pointing out that no single currency  has the strength to stand alone as world reserve:</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>I think the dominance of the greenback is the root cause  of global financial and economic crises…The solution to this is to  replace the national currency with a global currency…”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i><b></b></i> I would mention that a “Phoenix” rises from the ashes of calamity  reborn.  What ashes are the elites expecting the new global currency to  rise from?</p>
<p>It is  important to note that <i>The Economist</i> is not just any random  financial  publication; it is in large part owned by the Rothschild  banking family  and is based out of the London financial center,  meaning, <i>The Economist</i>  does not have to “guess” on the economic  developments of the future; it  has an inside track on exactly what is  planned to occur.</p>
<p>You can see my more recent analysis on the IMF global currency scheme <a href="http://www.alt-market.com/articles/2126-false-eastwest-paradigm-hides-the-rise-of-global-currency">here</a>.</p>
<p>A plan for global governance has also been touted by international  elites  over the years, the roots of which would supposedly begin around  2015.  The Gorbachev Foundation, which boasts many American elites as  members,  has long predicted the rise of a global governance. In 1995,  the  executive director of the foundation, Jim Garrison, had this to say  to  the <i>San Francisco Weekly</i>:</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>Over the next 20 to 30  years, we are going to end up  with world government. … It’s inevitable.  It will happen and become  just as normal to have a relationship with the  rest of the world as we  now have, say, if you are a Californian and you  go to Vermont.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i><b></b></i> At the  Gorbachev-led State of the World Forum in 1995, Council On   Foreign  Relations member Zbigniew Brzezinski had this to say:</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>We do not  have a New World Order. … We cannot leap into  world  government in one  quick step. … In brief, the precondition for  eventual  globalization —  genuine globalization — is progressive   regionalization, because thereby  we move toward larger, more stable,   more cooperative units.</p>
</blockquote>

I have seen an incredible array  of analytic  interpretations of the macro-economy by multiple mainstream  and  independent financial writers, but very few of them recognize that  the  conflict between the West and the eastern BRICS is nothing more  than a  farce. I have compiled a considerable profile of evidence on the  reality  that governments like Russia and China are actually complicit  in the  formation of a global currency and global government controlled  by the  IMF. You can see that evidence <a href="http://www.alt-market.com/articles/2074-russia-is-dominated-by-global-banks-too" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="http://www.alt-market.com/articles/2168-the-new-world-order-and-the-rise-of-the-east" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://www.alt-market.com/articles/2126-false-eastwest-paradigm-hides-the-rise-of-global-currency" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>China in particular has loudly pronounced a need for a global  currency system to replace the dollar, and they have suggested that this  system be <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Business/story?id=7168919">controlled by the IMF</a>:</p>
<p><b>The world economic crisis shows the “inherent  vulnerabilities and  systemic risks in the existing international  monetary system,” Gov. Zhou  Xiaochuan said in an essay released Monday  by the bank. He recommended  creating a currency made up of a basket of  global currencies and  controlled by the International Monetary Fund and  said it would help “to  achieve the objective of safeguarding global  economic and financial  stability.”</b></p>
<p>China is NOT  anti-establishment or anti-new world order, nor is  Russia. Eastern  opposition to the NWO is a lie. Period. In fact, the  BRICS have argued  only for greater inclusion in the IMF system and have  no intention of  developing a legitimate alternative to “Western”  globalization. If you  do not understand that the BRICS are part of the  NWO, not opposed to it,  then you do not understand a thing.</p>
<p>With the BRICS on board with  the plan for global currency, what is  likely to happen over the course  of the next few years if the schedule  for an economic reset is on track  for 2018?</p>
<p>As I outlined in my last article, the U.S. in particular  has been  prepped like a sacrificial lamb, with the populace for the  most part  oblivious to the extent of the threat. Middle-class wealth is  being  driven into bonds and will be driven more so by market declines,  which  will progress over the next few months. This “herding” of capital  into  bonds is only in preparation for the death of the dollar’s world   reserve status, thus erasing what little savings were left among the   common citizenry.</p>

<p>The ceremony initiating our nation’s fiscal destruction  will likely  take place in the near term. To achieve global  centralization by 2018,  the elites would need a serious crisis soon in  order to provide the  proper collective panic required to generate public  consent for global  economic governance in four years’ time.</p>
<p>The  first, most important factor to consider is the fake conflict  between  the IMF and the U.S. Congress over the approval of IMF policy  changes  agreed upon in 2010. The U.S. has yet to officially sign off on  the IMF  policy measures that would bring more “inclusiveness” for  developing  nations like Russia and China, and this has led the IMF to  assert that a  move forward without the U.S. is necessary. IMF head  Christine Lagarde  is now demanding that Congress pass the reforms of  2010; but with the  election of a predominantly Republican government,  those reforms have <a href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2014/10/29/christine_lagarde_imf_diplomat_of_the_year"> little or no chance of being approved</a>.</p>
<p>Lagarde recently joked that she would be willing to “belly dance” to  get IMF reforms passed (I would pass them just to avoid the gut churning  image of that belly dance), but the joke will ultimately be on the U.S.  as IMF heads suggest that if the current Congress does not pass reforms  by the end of this year, they will be forced to apply a “Plan B”.  The  details of this Plan B are not public.</p>
<p>It is now highly likely that the IMF will set policy WITHOUT  the  input of the U.S., as they have warned they would, crippling the   assumptions by many that the IMF is somehow a “U.S.-owned institution.”   It is actually the reverse; the IMF is setting the stage for ownership   of the U.S. monetary structure, along with the Bank Of International   Settlements, which appears to be <a href="http://www.sharelynx.com/papers/BISRTWOM.php">the capstone</a> of the NWO system.</p>
<p>The  next IMF meeting on SDR inclusion is not set, but will probably  take  place in early 2015. It is expected that China and the Yuan will  be  officially added to the SDR basket. Gold should also be watched   carefully. There is a reason why the BRICS have been accumulating   thousands of tons of the precious metal. The IMF introduction of gold   into the SDR basket is inevitable, and a new Bretton Woods   style-agreement has already been called for by a number of elites.</p>
<p>The IMF has been <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2011/02/10/markets/dollar/">openly discussing</a> the ascension of the SDR to replace the dollar as the world reserve  currency since at least 2011.</p>
<p>With  developing nations already asking for help from the IMF due to   volatility caused by the Fed taper and the BRICS well into their own   programs to remove the dollar as the world reserve, the only question   left is: How will the banks be able to accomplish the currency reset   without taking blame for the resulting catastrophe that will no doubt   bury the majority of middle-class and poor?</p>
<p>There is no way  around it. The elites need a geopolitical disaster  so overwhelming that  all economic changes taking place in the  background go completely  unnoticed. They also need to set themselves up  as the prognosticators  and rescuing heroes in the midst of the coming  chaos, as outlined in my  last article.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/familysurvivalsystem.html" rel="nofollow" style="float: right;margin-left: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-FNX5buD7gFA/U2KovfyZRBI/AAAAAAAAAlk/oDTnmRV75Ng/s220/fsc-2.jpg" alt=""></a>I do not know what that disaster will specifically  look like,  because there are too many possibilities to consider. Think  about this  honestly, 10 years ago, would you or your friends and family  have ever  thought that the U.S. would be at war in Syria with a  terrorist  organization we created ourselves out of thin air? That we  would be  immersed in renewed tensions and the possibility of economic  warfare  with Russia? That our presidency would have attempted and failed  the  initiation of socialized healthcare? That our military would be  tapped  as a possible response force for domestic unrest? That an  outbreak of  Ebola would be suggested as a trigger for medical martial  law?</p>
<p>How many conspiracies have been exposed in just the past few  years?  How many government crimes have hit the headlines and then  disappeared?  Benghazi, Fast and Furious, IRS targeting of activists,   government-aided illegal immigration, etc. — a nonstop parade of   corruption that few would have thought possible a decade ago. We are   being boiled slowly, economically as well as politically. We are being   conditioned to accept imminent crisis as a way of daily life, to become   used to it and to blame these crises on hundreds of various scapegoats,   but never the international banks.</p>
<p>And while the Titanic sinks,  the band plays on, as mainstream  pundits and dupes accuse independent  analysts of “crying wolf.” The  economic endgame is not about collapse  alone. Collapse is nothing more  than a process that ends abruptly only  when public faith is finally  lost. The endgame is about acceptance — the  acceptance by the masses of  a “new normal” in which financial and  political terror become the  foundation of daily life. The endgame is,  first and foremost, about the  psyche of mankind and its mutation into  something unrecognizable. This  kind of pervasive conditioning requires  immeasurable fear. Our  economic philosophy of sovereign trade and  identity cannot be erased  without it. The elites have already given us  their timeline. The crash  of 2008 was only the beginning of the program,  and 2014-2015 looks to  be the next stage. I have written hundreds of  articles on how to  prepare and diffuse the dangers of the impending reset, but the most   important issue of all is that people understand the threat is at their   doorstep. It’s not a few years off or a decade away; it’s here now. We  are right in the middle of collapse, even if many cannot see it.  Watch  global developments carefully, as market volatility increases and   international conflicts escalate. Time is up.</p>

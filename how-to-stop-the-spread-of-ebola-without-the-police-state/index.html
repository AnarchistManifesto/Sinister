<a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2014/10/how-to-stop-spread-of-ebola-without.html"><b>Activist Post</b></a></p>
<p>Amidst the propaganda surrounding ebola and the specter of forced quarantine, mandatory vaccination, the police state, fear porn exposing ebola around every single corner and under every single bed, as well as credible suggestions that ebola is not actually infecting anyone in the cases presented by the government and media, it is hard to determine the seriousness of the threat posed by the disease to the United States.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, there are a number of outlets and researchers suggesting the possibility that ebola is a manufactured threat being used to terrify Americans into compliance with even greater violations of their civil rights, an increase of the police state, forced vaccination, and dislocation. This suggestion is indeed a distinct possibility and one that should not be ignored. However, for the purposes of this article, we will work on the assumption that ebola is indeed inside the United States and that the disease is posing a real threat to public health. </p>
<p><a name="more"></a>Assuming that the threat of ebola is real, there are a number of solutions to the festering pandemic that are acutely being ignored. Travel bans from affected areas, greater screening at airports and other national access points, particularly the U.S./Mexico  border have all been largely ignored until recently. A comprehensive policy of treatment and containment of the disease that does not entail the implementation of martial law and the violation of Constitutional rights also appears to be nonexistent. </p>
<p>Yet there is also a more long term set of solutions that must be implemented in order to prevent the disease from spreading and to prevent its appearance in the first place. The end of austerity, the rebuilding of economic opportunity, access to proper nutrition, and the progress and development of the American health system are all essential to treating and preventing ebola and disease like it.</p>

<p><b>Austerity begets disease</b></p>
<p>Throughout history, plagues and disease epidemic can be traced directly to austerity, low living standards, and/or poor sanitation conditions often coupled with inadequate nutrition and lack of available treatment.  War and periods of struggle are also precursors to epidemics. Any one of these conditions can themselves beget plague and disease. Yet, when taken together, they are a recipe for devastation and plague. </p>
<p>There are numerous examples of the connections between lower living standards and the decline of public health throughout history. To comment on all of them would be outside of the scope of this article. However, a few of these parallels must be drawn.</p>
<p>When discussing the emergence and ramifications of mass plague, one cannot avoid discussion of the Bubonic Plague or Black Plague/Black Death. Indeed, anytime there is the consideration of an epidemic that threatens to become massive in scale and even a pandemic, discussions of the Black Plague rise back to the surface.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/backyardliberty.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 0em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ONE8Lk_RzR8/UjeZnRyZRTI/AAAAAAAAVJw/TMNS4NzHKZo/s220/BL_158220.gif"></a>Although usually presented by mainstream outlets and medical propagandists as an example of what happened to a primitive people in a time before drugs and vaccines as well as the possible consequences of the lack of total fealty to the medical establishment today, the Black Plague had its roots in much more basic and wide-reaching sources than mere medical treatment options.</p>
<p>As economic historian Webster G. Tarpley stated, </p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>
We have a tradition to draw on that goes back in the Western World to the 1340s. And it was in the 1340s that this pandemic called the Black Plague began to come into southern Europe, the Mediterranean ports, coming from the Levant, coming from the eastern Mediterranean and coming from further in the far east. And you have to also bear in mind that, in order to have a pandemic, it really takes two ingredients as I see it anyway. One is you have to have the contagion. You have to have the virus or the bacterium or whatever it is. On the other hand, you’ve got to have conditions. And the conditions can be situations of bad sanitation, no water available, no sewage drainage, no adequate systems in that regard. And then you’ve also got to look at the nutrition. You’ve got to look at the physical state of the human subjects involved.</p>
<p>And I can say that, in the 1340s, the thing that we see in the 1300s as they go along is the effects of an austerity policy. It is the domination of the Mediterranean basin by Venetian and Genoese bankers and the kinds of usury that they imposed on the rulers – the kings or princes or other potentates – which requires then an increased pressure on sharecroppers on farmers and others leaving them with less and less of their food crops to devote to nutrition and more and more of it being sold off elsewhere as a cash crop. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://facstaff.bloomu.edu/hickey/late_middle_ages.htm">Certainly Europe met the requirements</a> Tarpley sets forth in terms of lack of adequate nutrition, poor sanitation standards, lack of available clean water, and persistent sewage issues. Austerity clearly was a factor as was the factor in the overall stress of the population struggling to survive under these conditions. What is also notable is the presence of war as a stressor and contributing factor to plague and disease. Shortly before and especially during the peak years of the Black Plague, Europe was embroiled in numerous wars. In fact, the state of Europe during this period was one of continual warfare. In addition, Europe as a whole and France in particular were bombarded by famine in the years leading up to the appearance of the Black Plague.</p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>Likewise, the 1918 Spanish Flu that killed millions of people worldwide came on the heels of World War 1 which left many places in the world ravaged with destruction, famine, and vastly reduced living standards. The high use of chemical weapons, particularly those which effect the human immune system,[1] also played a part in the virulent spread of the Spanish Flu. Although many theories have been proposed regarding the source of the pandemic (including the possibility that it was created on a military base in Kansas), it is without a doubt the living conditions of the world that provided a fertile ground for its spread and severity.</p>
<p>With this in mind, however, it is important to take a look at the conditions in which we find ourselves in the present day with respect to pandemics or, at the very least, the possibility of pandemics. </p>
<p>The United States and the world finds itself in an economic depression. For some countries, particularly the United States, living standards have been vastly reduced compared to those which previous generations have experienced. While technology may have advanced, the applications of that technology in most areas other than entertainment have been intentionally withheld from general society. </p>
<p>It is also an unfortunate fact that some parts of the world have never had high living standards to lose. Whenever the West catches a cold, Africa catches pneumonia. The Middle East is in the process of being destroyed and Asia remains a pit of slave labor, crowded living conditions, and inadequate infrastructure. </p>
<p>In terms of the possibility of a pandemic and susceptibility to disease, the world, after years of war and decades of “free trade” and globalization, the lowering of their living standards, increasing pollution, and deindustrialization as well as the prevalence of GM food, chemical toxicity, immune system destroying vaccines, chemtrails, processed foods, and other chemical poisonings and contributors to weakened immunity, the United States has left itself vulnerable to a number of potential pandemics and illnesses.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/ultimatesurvivalplan.html" rel="nofollow" style="float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-CTsdDqKcvhI/T7GjToaksaI/AAAAAAAAO2s/8vEb9HmqOhk/s316/160x316.gif"></a>As Webster Tarpley stated,</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>
So, generally speaking, I would say, after twenty years of globalization, which is a form of austerity, it’s a form of International Monetary Fund shock therapy for the world, the vulnerability of humanity to new pandemic disease is large. I don’t know how large. It’s very difficult to get statistics. We can simply estimate that, in the United States, we’ve had several years now of austerity. If you look at southern Europe, you certainly have to say that Portugal, Spain, Greece, Ireland, Italy, some other places – these places have undergone brutal austerity and their vulnerability to pandemics is increasing. And that certainly includes war zones. Imagine what Syria is like today. Imagine what Iraq is like. Imagine what Lebanon is like as a result of these austerity policies. So we’ve got I think a very very dangerous mix. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Improvements in sanitation and access to nutrition/good food reduces disease</b></p>
<p>The question of the relationship between austerity, low living standards, and disease is not merely a philosophical supposition, it is at the heart of the matter. In other words, the answer to disease prevention is not found in vaccines, drugs, or police states, it is found in greater standards of living, cleaner water, better sanitation, sewage treatment, clean air, non-poisonous foods, and adequate access to nutrition.</p>
<p>Indeed, the connection between the reduction in diseases and the improvements in public health over the last 150 years to the development of vaccines has been thoroughly debunked. Indeed, the idea that vaccines are even safe and/or effective has likewise been revealed as a tragic deception.</p>
<p>When looking at the <a href="http://childhealthsafety.wordpress.com/graphs/#Meas_ScarlFev_etc">historical data of vaccination</a> correlation to increase in public health and the decrease of incidents of disease, one finds that, in virtually every case, the diseases being targeted by the vaccines <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2014/02/vaccines-needle-and-damage-done.html">were already declining</a> before the introduction of the vaccines. While the CDC chooses to present deceptively edited charts and graphs of the rates of infection and death from Pertussis (Whooping Cough), Measles, Scarlet Fever, Pneumonia, Influenza, Typhoid, Diptheria, and Tuberculosis, among other diseases, had all declined sharply long before the vaccines for these diseases were introduced. The diseases declined with the increase of public sanitation standards, living conditions, and working conditions. In addition, the rates of many of these diseases were much higher during periods of war and famine than in times of peace and plenty.  </p>
<p><b>US health system currently inadequate</b></p>
<p>Unfortunately, while the United States finds itself in a precarious position with the lowering of living standards, growing austerity, toxic poisoning through food, pollution, pharmaceuticals, and geoengineering, it is also true that the U.S. health system in wholly inadequate and ill prepared to deal with a large scale pandemic, particularly with a disease such as ebola. </p>
<p>With this in mind, Tarpley assesses the U.S. health system by stating, </p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>
The US health care system strikes me as a very capable one but with no depth. In other words, it has excellent quality facilities but it does not have enough of them. It has no logistical depth. It is susceptible to being overwhelmed.</p>
<p>During this debate over Obamacare, we kept hearing “Oh, the US healthcare system is the best in the world.!” It’s true if you’ve got money. If you’ve got coverage. And as long as you don’t have too many people demanding it.</p>
<p>I would say it’s a high quality system but brittle. Once it’s broken through it’s going to be in big trouble. I can be overwhelmed and it might easily be overwhelmed and I think we should bear that in mind. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>
We have a situation where we can be overwhelmed by numbers and it’s a result of austerity policies. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tarpley’s assertions are borne out by the facts. When one takes a look at a study, <a href="http://www.oecd.org/els/health-systems/Health-at-a-Glance-2013.pdf">Health At A Glance 2013</a>, by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) which looked at the availability of hospital beds per person in a number of different countries across the world found that the number of hospital beds per person has declined radically over the last few decades particularly in the Western world. In fact, in these terms, the United States ranked near the bottom of the list, 27th on a list of 40 nations examined by the OECD study. Above the U.S. was Russia, Japan, Korea, and Austria as well as countries on the lower end of economic development and living standards such as Estonia, Hungary, and Slovenia. A comparison would be Japan’s 13.4 hospital beds per 1,000 people in the population to the United States’ 3.05 beds per thousand.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/alive.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-DngwEhvTp4M/U5S_N7rNHkI/AAAAAAAAAqc/9UL3kisfvVs/s220/300x25003906f96-de83-4af9-91e5-2a1d40b60fee.jpg"></a>The United States’ poor performance is, of course, a direct result of austerity policies and laissez-faire “free trade” ideology. It is also at odds with the true American system of development and maintenance of both “hard” and “soft” infrastructure. </p>
<p>For instance, consider the fact that, in 1946, the U.S. Congress passed a law that was signed by President Truman called the Hill-Burton Act. Hill-Burton was designed to address the inadequacy of the U.S. health care system by working toward the goal of <a href="http://igpa.uillinois.edu/system/files/HBCrowdOutpaper_AEAs.pdf">4.5 beds per 1,000 people</a>. The hospitals were to be built via grants and guaranteed loans. </p>
<p>Although the goal had nearly been reached in the early 1970s, free market fetishism, Wall Street vulturism, and government collusion succeeded in destroying about 1/3 of the hard-earned “soft” hospital infrastructure. Many of these hospitals were privatized, asset stripped, and sold off. Others were simply driven out of existence or defunded.</p>
<p>Sadly, in 2014, the United States has sunk below the standards set nearly 70 years ago. </p>
<p>This lack of hospital beds is only one aspect of how the United States health system is inadequate. There are many more such as a lack of emergency medical supplies and a lack of well-trained staff. Indeed, despite the cost of education and the alleged greater understanding of disease and treatment, it is clear enough that America’s nursing staff as a whole is vastly inferior to that of 60-70 years ago. Such is also the case with American doctors, trained as soldiers of pharmaceutical companies, niche specialities, and oftentimes their own massive egos. </p>
<p>A reliance solely on pharmaceuticals, unnecessary surgeries, a fundamental misunderstanding of many areas of nutrition, poorly educated staff and practitioners, as well as a system whose access is restricted to wealthy by either the “free market” or government mandated formulas, and a lack of available services leading to increased wait times all combine to spell out a disaster for the American health system. A pandemic of a deadly disease would only serve to fast track that disaster.</p>
<p><b>Solutions For Possible Pandemic of Ebola</b></p>
<p>So what are the solutions to a possible pandemic? The U.S. government has done everything in its power to bring ebola in to the country, spread it, and then provide a solution in the form of forced vaccination, police states, and forced quarantine. On the other hand, many activists are now finding out that “free market” hands off solutions are entirely inadequate and unappealing when faced with reality.</p>
<p>Thus, a comprehensive plan of response, treatment, and prevention must immediately be taken into consideration. </p>
<p>1.) Immediately halt flights coming from infected countries. Political correctness, funded and promoted in this instance by <a href="http://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/voices/looking-past-quarantine-community-health">George Soros’ Open Society Institute</a>, is not worth the risk of a pandemic. </p>
<p>2.) Secure America’s borders. Again, political correctness is not worth the risk of a pandemic. Open borders are, without a doubt, present a threat of the spread of disease.</p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>3.) Forget the police state. Putting aside the question of whether vaccines are safe or effective, the idea of mandatory vaccination or detention for the purposes of quarantine should be dismissed immediately. Violating the rights of an individual for the purposes of stopping a pandemic, handling a national emergency, or to protect the collective is entirely unacceptable. Such is the practice of a totalitarian state. Violating the rights of individuals is the sure sign that a society has ceased to exist as free and/or that it is a participatory/voluntary act working for the benefit of the individual as well as the societal whole. </p>
<p>Simply put, there should be no forced or coerced vaccination. There should be no forced or coerced removal and relocation of citizens from their homes for any purposes.</p>
<div class="code-block code-block-1" style="margin: 0px">
<div align="center" class="mrf-external">
<a href="https://amorain.com/?E=ikLQsSIi%2fgaXBh0SRK5s8g%3d%3d&amp;s1="><img src="https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/500.jpg"></a></p>

</div>
<p>4.) If the disease spreads to the point of serious danger of contamination of the general population, confinement to one’s own personal property is sufficient. Forced removal from one’s home is never an option. Neither is forced medication. If an individual chooses not to seek medical attention in a secure facility, then that person is well within their rights to refuse such treatment. If an individual is infected with a pandemic virus with a high kill rate, then the individual can shelter at home, with treatment and supplies being brought in from the outside at the expense of the U.S. government.</p>
<p>5.) An immediate launch of a Manhattan Project style effort to research causes, treatment, and cures for ebola. The United States scientific community – both private and government – combined with the requisite funding from the U.S. government, are quite capable of producing results that might, at one time, have seemed unattainable. Even today, when the best and the brightest minds of the scientific community have been recruited to develop greater methods of control, those minds can and should be turned loose against disease and other major problems of society. Clearly, science has progressed much further than that which the average person has access to. This science should be made available to all for the betterment of all.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/familysurvivalsystem.html" rel="nofollow" style="float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-FNX5buD7gFA/U2KovfyZRBI/AAAAAAAAAlk/oDTnmRV75Ng/s220/fsc-2.jpg"></a>Thus, this massive project should include scientific research into the medical options, pharmaceuticals, surgery, and other protocol of the medical industry, as well as the natural health field with homeopathy, herbal healing, nutrition, and other forms of treatment and prevention. No stone should be left unturned. As should be obvious, such a project and its research should be free from the influence and concerns of profits, patents, and career advancement.</p>
<p>This type of emergency project can easily be funded with 0% interest credit created by a nationalized (or at least partially nationalized) federal reserve. </p>
<p>6.) Medical Infrastructure. In order to cope with a pandemic or the possibility thereof, the United States can no longer maintain a healthcare system that is “a very capable one but with no depth.” An immediate start to a program of hospital building, Manhattan Project-style scientific research, and emergency treatment preparations must be undertaken. The goal of achieving the requisite number of hospital beds per person as set forth in 1946 must be achieved as quickly as possible. This type of emergency project can easily be funded with 0% interest credit created by a nationalized (or at least partially nationalized) federal reserve. This money can be augmented with a 1% Wall Street Sales Tax for any projects that requires on- budget spending.</p>
<p>7.) Access to Nutrition. Perhaps one of the most important aspects of prevention of disease is the nutritional content of a population’s food supply and that the population’s access to it. A food supply made up of a majority of processed, chemical laden, and genetically modified food is one that is destined to cause and facilitate the existence of mass disease. A blanket ban on Genetically Modified organisms (of any kind) for food purposes for humans or animals or any other commercial purposes (beyond a controlled scientific setting) must be imposed. Simultaneously, a program of parity agriculture must be initiated so that famers do not lose money to produce the food that feeds the country. Parity pricing should replace subsidies and “free market” ideology. Organic crops should be particularly rewarded by these policies so as to ensure that the food grown in America is the cleanest most nutritious and affordable food in the world.</p>
<p>8.) Environmental Contamination and National Infrastructure</p>
<p>As important as nutrition may be, sanitation infrastructure and clean water are probably the most important aspect of public health. While the United States once led the world in public sanitation, clean water, and other forms of high living standards, the worldwide economic depression and cuts have reduced this infrastructure to a shell of its former self. Thus, an immediate push to not only repair and maintain existing levels of waste water treatment, sewage disposal, sewage treatment, water treatment, trash disposal and recycling, and other relevant systems of public sanitation but also to improve and expand these systems must be initiated. This type of emergency project can easily be funded with 0% interest credit created by a nationalized (or at least partially nationalized) federal reserve. This money can be augmented with a 1% Wall Street Sales Tax for any projects that require on budget spending.</p>
<p>9.) Program for Africa</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/backyardliberty.html" rel="nofollow" style="float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-v1Ic7et7gfI/U5TCyAKfSdI/AAAAAAAAAsU/wQ1oCf5viR0/s220/bulletproofhome4.gif"></a>While all foreign aid must always take a back seat to the needs of the United States (from the standpoint of the American people and American leadership) there are benefits to foreign aid and foreign leadership in certain specific parameters. The attempt to cure and prevent disease is one of those parameters. The idea is that if you are able to prevent the disease from ever appearing or, at the very least, cure the disease and stop its spread from the original location, the United States will ultimately benefit from the eradication of the threat of that disease ever making it to America and causing death and social upheaval inside the country.</p>
<p>The investment of both the U.S. government and private industry in the development of the third world in an environmentally and culturally friendly way that benefits all of those concerned must eventually take place. Africa, Central and South America, the Middle East, and other places across the world that lack the public infrastructure to grapple with disease or the infrastructure and food supply to prevent sickness must be supplied and empowered with this technology and equipment. </p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p>Regardless of the source of the ebola pandemic – whether entirely manufactured by conspiracy or real and spread by incompetence – the truth is that it is being used to usher in a police state of forced vaccination, forced removal and relocation as well as the construction and habitation of what amounts to FEMA camps. This cannot be allowed and it must not be tolerated. </p>
<p>The above solutions are an absolute necessity to prevent pandemics in the future and to improve the living standards of all Americans. The important thing is that we do not allow fear to stampede us into accepting a totalitarian system that Americans can scarcely imagine.</p>

<p>Over the years, parents have more and more commonly been blamed of child abuse if their child is diagnosed with the “triad” of injuries associated with Shaken Baby Syndrome (SBS) after receiving a vaccine. The “triad” includes bleeding inside the brain, bleeding behind the eyes and swelling or inflammation of the brain.</p>
<p>When a medical professional suspects that a baby has been violently shaken, they will examine the baby for the “triad” of injuries associated with SBS. These are subdural haematoma (bleeds inside the brain), retinal haemorrhages (bleeds behind the eyes) and cerebral edema (swelling or inflammation inside the brain).</p>
<p><b>The Triad of Injuries…</b></p>
<p><a name="more"></a><i>Bleeding Inside the Brain</i></p>
<p>Norman Guthkelch, a retired neurosurgeon, wrote the first description of Shaken Baby Syndrome in 1971 in his paper “Infantile Subdural Haematoma and its Relationship to Whiplash Injuries,” in which he discussed 23 cases of strongly suspected parental assault on children under the age of three. He concluded that:</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>It has been shown that there is a discrepancy between the frequency of subdural hematoma occurring in battered children and of the same condition complicating head injuries of other origin, the incidence in the former being unexpectedly high, though in most of those in whom there was no actual skull fracture there was not even  clear evidence of the application of direct violence to the head. This suggests that when the head is not the main target of attack the likely mechanism of production of the hematoma is one in which repeated sheering strains of one sort or another are applied to the cranial contents. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>It follows that since all cases of infantile subdural hematoma are best assumed to be traumatic unless proved otherwise it would be unwise to disregard the possibility that one of these has been caused by serious violence, repetition of which may prove fatal, simply on the basis that there are no gross fractures or other radiological bone changes in the limbs, nor any fractures of the skull. [1]</p>
</blockquote>
<div align="center">
<p>    <ins class="adsbygoogle" style="height: 90px;width: 728px"></ins><br />
    <a href="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js">//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js</a><br />
    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || ).push({});</p>
</div>
<p>
However, the violent shaking of a young child is not the only cause of the triad of injuries. These injuries can also occur after short falls, illnesses such as encephalitis and meningitis, birth trauma, vitamin deficiencies and genetic illnesses such as brittle bone syndrome. These causes are identified on the <i>British Medical Journal</i>’s online guide “Best Practice: Abusive Head Trauma in Infants.” [2]</p>
<p><i>Bleeding Behind the Eyes</i></p>
<p>The paper written by attorney Dermot Garrett entitled “Overcoming Defense Expert Testimony in Abusive Head Trauma Cases” indicates this fact very strongly when the author discusses retinal bleeding on page 35. [3] Garrett writes that a presentation at the 2010 American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus Annual Meeting analyzed the results of 62 studies of pediatric retinal hemorrhages published since 1965.</p>
<p>Garrett says that all of the children studied were younger than 11 years of age, had undergone a detailed examination by an ophthalmologist and had been diagnosed with retinal hemorrhages due to confirmed accidental head trauma or non-accidental head trauma. The results of the analysis showed that seventy-eight percent of patients with confirmed accidental head trauma had retinal hemorrhages, in comparison to just 5.3 percent of the non-accidental head trauma patients, proving that not all cases of retinal bleeds are necessarily caused by child abuse.</p>
<p><i>Swelling Inside the Brain</i></p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/vaccinetruth.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" height="175" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-38G3VOJQToQ/TfAZ2bc-qRI/AAAAAAAAJQ8/LA-TGAvVeWk/250x250-b.jpg" width="200"></a>Another cause of the triad of injuries associated with SBS is vaccine-induced meningitis/encephalitis, a severe reaction to vaccinations.</p>
<p>Early in 2013, Marahendra K. Patel et al. published a paper in the <i>Journal of Pharmacology &amp; Pharmacotherapeutics</i>, which discusses the case of a five month-old baby boy diagnosed with suspected post-vaccination encephalopathy following the DPT vaccination. Tests concluded that a reaction to the DPT vaccination was probable and in their discussion, the authors discussed several other worrying cases of similar reactions from India.

<p>In 2010, Dr. Lucija Tomljenovic wrote an extensive paper exposing evidence that she uncovered surrounding many cases in which children developed encephalitis or meningitis after they received vaccinations from as early as 1983, which she says were deliberately covered up by the UK government’s JCVI (Joint Committee for Vaccination and Immunization). [5]</p>
<p>Dr. Viera Scheibner mentions vaccine-induced encephalomyelitis, characterized by brain swelling and hemorrhaging, in 1998 when she wrote a paper published in <i>Nexus</i> titled “Shaken Baby Syndrome: The Vaccination Link.” She had become so worried that parents were being falsely accused after their children had suffered a vaccine injury that she opened her paper by stating:</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>Some time ago I started getting requests from lawyers or the accused parents themselves for expert reports. A close study of the history of these cases revealed something distinctly sinister: in every single case, the symptoms appeared shortly after the baby’s vaccinations. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>While investigating the personal medical history of these babies based on the care-givers’ diaries and medical records, I quickly established that these babies were given one or more of the series of so-called routine shots-hepatitis B, DPT (diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus), polio and HiB (Haemophilus influenza type B) – shortly before they developed symptoms of illness resulting in serious brain damage or death. [6]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, Dr. Harold Buttram and F. Edward Yazbak wrote on the subject of false accusations of SBS and vaccine-induced encephalitis in their paper titled Shaken Baby Syndrome or Vaccine Induced Encephalitis: The Story of Baby Alan. [7]</p>
<p>Dr. Buttram opens his paper by stating:</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>In the following report Dr. Yazbak and myself have reviewed the case of an infant death which we believe to have been mistakenly diagnosed as shaken baby syndrome, the true cause of death in our opinions having been a vaccine-induced encephalitis. Having carefully followed the case and its developments for nearly a year, the report represents untold numbers of hours of study and investigation into the many technical parameters of the case. From this study we have come to realize that this case is representative of an emerging pattern of increasingly frequent vaccine reactions on the modern scene, which are being overlooked or misdiagnosed by our present health-care system. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>The Story of Baby Alan is a poignant one, all the more so because it is something that could happen to any young couple or parent. Although the story is necessarily technical, nevertheless we urge that you read it. If you are a young person contemplating having a family, it is something that could happen to you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite all of this evidence, however, parents continue to be blamed of shaking their babies before all other possible diagnoses have been fully explored.</p>
<p><b>The Reid Technique</b></p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/vaccineexempt.html" rel="nofollow" style="float: right;margin-left: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-WfI77BHRfFg/TpHdZMZJHeI/AAAAAAAALS4/KDabWFqA1jM/s200/AVGLE2.0-CD.jpg" alt=""></a>When SBS or non-accidental head injury is suspected, the police will interview the parents or caregiver who was caring for the child at the time the child became ill. According to parents who have undergone this interview, the interview process is extremely intimidating, and many succumb to the bullying tactics used, either by admitting that they injured their child or by accepting a plea bargain.</p>
<p>This may be due to the use of the ‘Reid Technique,’ a technique which is often used when interviewing a person suspected of shaking their child. [8, 9]</p>
<p>The Reid Technique is used in police departments around the world. It is basically made up of nine steps, and in my opinion, it is put in place to intimidate and force a confession out of innocent people. The nine steps are:</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>1. The police officer will present the suspect with evidence that they committed the crime. (This evidence can be real or fake.) </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>2. The officer comes up with a story as to why they believe the suspect committed the crime. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>3. If the suspect tries to deny that they committed the crime, the detective will immediately interrupt the suspect. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>4. If the suspect tries to give a logical explanation as to why it is not possible for them to have committed the crime, this explanation will be refuted. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The evidence that Sergeant Christopher Savage, a former police officer, gave to me in an interview last year discussing SBS demonstrates that this procedure is commonly used. [10]</p>
<p><b>Researchers Uncover The Truth</b></p>
<p>Early this year, Dr. Michael Innis published his latest peer-reviewed study in Clinical Medicine Research. His paper titled “Autoimmunity and Non-Accidental Injury in Children” discusses the cases of five children suffering from brain injuries and fractures after vaccinations. After studying each case in depth, he concluded that vaccination could be responsible for the triad of injuries commonly associated with SBS. [11]</p>
<p>In his paper, Dr. Innis outlines that the response to antigenic stimulation damaged the beta cells in the pancreas causing hypoinsulinaemia (unusually low levels of insulin in the blood), which inhibited the cellular uptake of vitamin C, resulting in liver dysfunction, failure of carboxylation of the vitamin K dependent proteins, resulting in hemorrhages and fractures associated with the triad. He concluded that fractures, retinal and subdural hemorrhages and encephalopathy in children are autoimmune responses to antigenic stimulation in a genetically susceptible individual.</p>
<p>He explains that common antigens are mandated vaccines, viral, bacterial and parasitic infections.</p>
<p>To understand exactly how cases of vaccine damage are frequently misdiagnosed as SBS, please read Dr. Innis’s paper in full.</p>
<p>I found his paper easy to read, interesting and revealing and I was particularly enlightened to see him open his paper by quoting the work of psychologist Lisa Blakemore-Brown, who in 1995-1996 became the first professional to identify that parents were being falsely accused of child abuse after their child had suffered a vaccine injury.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/vaccinetruth.html" rel="nofollow" style="float: right;margin-left: 1em;margin-bottom: 0em"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-MkKSFqq5-DE/TfAbRwTtoXI/AAAAAAAAJRE/itK2KofpgVU/VACCINE-BANNER.gif" alt=""></a><b>Do You Need More Proof?</b></p>
<p>Many other professionals support the fact that parents are being falsely accused of SBS. In 2008, Kent R. Holcomb published the paper “Shaken Baby Syndrome: Actual Innocence Petition,” in which he demonstrated that the Shaken Baby Syndrome theory was unstable by using a “hypothetical case.” [12]</p>
<p>In his paper, Holcomb states that the biomechanical branch of science is the one and only discipline with the expertise, experimental data, and responsibility to determine if a biomechanical event such as human shaking (SBS) or lethal minor falls (LMF) can or cannot cause potentially fatal injuries such as subdural hematoma (SDH).</p>
<p>For years, the triad of injuries has been the only evidence used in criminal procedures to convict parents of shaking their babies. According to a growing number of professionals, this misguided trust has resulted in many innocent parents being charged and convicted of murder.</p>
<p>However, times are changing, and as Holcomb explains, the history of medicine is full of examples of practices that, during their times, were generally accepted by a consensus of medical opinion, only to be later rejected as useless, potentially harmful, or sometimes even lethal.</p>
<p>Professionals are recognizing that Shaken Baby Syndrome is an unsafe diagnosis, due to the evidence being presented with the use of biomechanics. According to Holcomb, the study of biomechanics has proven that humans lack the physical strength needed to cause fatal brain injuries from manual shaking alone. He says that if a child were to be shaken as described in SBS cases, then this violence would result in a high incidence of spinal paralysis from neck injuries in infants, which has never been reported in association with SBS.</p>
<p>In 2009, Holcomb published a paper titled “Justification for a Federal Injunction to Suspend All Vaccine Licenses Based on Unreasonable Health Risks and Causal Links to Chronic Disease Pandemics.”</p>
<p>Holcomb states very clearly that vaccines are unsafe at all levels. He says that a hypothesis is not proven until all the data has been read. He says:</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>When evaluating vaccine-safety-hypotheses, like all other hypotheses, the SHHS (Secretary of Health and Human Services) cannot accept the hypothesis as proven nor upgrade it to scientific theory, until said hypothesis is submitted to vigorous scientific testing and until all attempts at falsification have failed. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>Assessing all the clinical trial and epidemiological studies that are available to support the “vaccines-are-safe” hypothesis, the SHHS would recognize that each one of these studies have flaws that would prevent them from earning QER I or QER II ratings. 21-day clinical trials that lack proper controls cannot support long-term safety claims. Every SHHS population study failed to either apply proper methodology/design or represent the proper population group. Other population studies, such as the secret VSD studies, though published, could not be classified as valid science since their methodologies and data sets were not disclosed. A hypothesis that cannot be examined or tested is not science but rather a faith-based belief system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Holcomb makes very clear throughout his paper that vaccinations have not been adequately tested or evaluated and states that when assessing the quality of data, the SHHS would know that “repeated opinions based on poor quality data cannot improve the quality of evidence.”</p>
<p>Holcomb states on page three of his paper, “a hypothesis that cannot be examined or tested is not science but rather a faith-based belief system.”</p>
<p>This statement is absolutely correct and I believe that the same could be said for the SBS hypothesis. The hypothesis that the “triad” of injuries can be caused by manually shaking a child has never been proven; therefore, it is a “faith-based belief system.” In fact, biomechanics have proven that it is not physically possible to manually shake a child with enough veracity to cause the “triad,” which is supported by the work of Dr. John D. Llyod and many others. [13]</p>

<p>Shaken Baby Syndrome is a hypothesis — a theory — as it has never been conclusively proven that a baby has been shaken to death. I have yet to find concrete evidence of someone physically shaking a baby so hard that the baby has later died solely from the “triad” of injuries. There are, however, a number of biomechanical studies stating that it is not physically possible to manually shake a baby to such a degree that it causes the triad of injuries associated with SBS.</p>
<p>Therefore, this leaves us with the question, Can vaccinations cause the “triad” of injuries associated with SBS?</p>

</div>
<p>There are no studies conclusively proving that vaccinations can cause the SBS triad, but since vaccinations have been never been proven to be conclusively safe, as it is classed as unethical to study equal numbers of vaccinated and unvaccinated children, this hypothesis cannot be examined or tested, therefore rendering it not as science,  but simply a faith-based belief system, as Holcomb suggested. Unfortunately, this belief syndrome has caused the incarceration of many innocent parents.</p>
<p>Not all parents who are accused of Shaken Baby Syndrome are child murderers, and as we have seen, there are many causes as to why children die from these horrendous brain injuries. The medical profession needs to examine the real causes of Shaken Baby Syndrome, especially vaccination, and stop using parents as their ‘get out of jail free card.’</p>

<p><i>Christina was born and educated in London, U.K. She left school to work in a children’s library, specializing in story telling and book buying. In 1978 Christina changed her career path to dedicate her time to caring for the elderly and was awarded the title of Care Giver of the Year for her work with the elderly in 1980. In1990 she adopted the first of two disabled boys, both with challenging behavior, complex disabilities and medical needs. In 1999 she was accused of Munchausen by Proxy after many failed attempts to get the boys’ complex needs met. Finally, she was cleared of all accusations after the independent psychologist Lisa Blakemore-Brown gave both boys the diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder and ADHD as part of what she described to be a complex tapestry of disorders. During the assessments Ms Blakemore-Brown discovered through the foster care diaries that the eldest boy had reacted adversely to the MMR vaccine. After taking an A Level in Psychology and a BTEC in Learning Disabilities Ms. England spent many years researching vaccines and adverse reactions. She went on to gain a Higher National Diploma  in journalism and media and currently writes for the American Chronicle, the Weekly Blitz, VacTruth and Namaste Publishing UK on immunization safety and efficacy whilst continuing to study for a BA Honors degree in English Literature and Humanities. England’s main areas of expertise are researching false allegations of child abuse and adverse reactions to vaccines. Her work is read internationally and has been translated into many languages. Ms England has been a guest on many radio shows and has spoken at seminars worldwide. She is the co author to the book </i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Syndrome-Vaccine-Induced-Encephalitis-ebook/dp/B004OEKDMS/ref=sr_1_fkmr1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1355752412&amp;sr=8-2-fkmr1&amp;keywords=%C2%91Shaken+Baby+Syndrome+or+Vaccine+Induced+Encephalitis+%C2%96+Are+Parents+Being+Falsely+Accused%3F%C2%92"><i>‘</i><b>Shaken Baby Syndrome or Vaccine Induced Encephalitis – Are Parents Being Falsely Accused?’</b></a><i> with Dr Harold Buttram.</i></p>

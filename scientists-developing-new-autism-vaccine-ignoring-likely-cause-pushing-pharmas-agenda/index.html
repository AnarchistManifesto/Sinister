<b><a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2013/05/scientists-developing-new-autism.html">Activist Post</a></b></p>
<p>For many years the medical establishment has denied that the MMR vaccine can cause autism, despite government papers stating that the MMR vaccine can cause an SSPE-like syndrome, which many professionals believe to be autism, the non-fatal form of SSPE. [1] Instead of researching this link further, as one would expect, scientists from the University of Guelph are developing a vaccine believed to alleviate specific symptoms found to be associated with autism.</p>
<p>(SSPE or subacute sclerosing panencephalitis is a degenerative neurological condition which affects a person’s behavior, memory and coordination, leading to fits, blindness and eventually death.)</p>
<p>For years, doctors have been bombarding the systems of autistic children with antibiotics to control the bacteria, clostridium bolteae, reported to be found in abundance in the guts of autistic children. This bacteria causes these children to suffer from constipation, diarrhea and other gastrointestinal related problems.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><b>Just Another Vaccine?</b></p>
<p>A paper written by Brittany Pequegnat, et al, states:</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>Individuals with autistic spectrum disorders (ASDs) are likely to experience chronic gastrointestinal (GI) irritations, such as constipation and diarrhea. GI disorders have a demonstrably high correlation with ASD and current literature suggests that it occurs with rates as high as 91.4% of patients. Of the ASD patients affected, 75.6% suffer from diarrhea. Diarrheal irritations can be extremely uncomfortable for a child and have been noted to have a loose association with regressive autism. [2]</p>

<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>In a small proof-of-principle intervention trial, vancomycin was orally administered to severely autistic children with chronic, persistent diarrhea, and short-term improvement of symptoms was seen in 8 out of 10 children. However, these improvements were not persistent, and once vancomycin was withdrawn, any behavioral gains in these children were lost; in turn suggesting that microbial dysbiosis was suppressed but not eliminated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, instead of studying existing papers and eliminating what is believed to be a possible cause of autism, scientists have developed yet another useless vaccine. Surely, it would have been more beneficial for scientists to research what is actually causing autistic children to have the overabundance of clostridium bolteae in their gut, rather than develop yet another vaccine, which by their own admittance does not work?</p>
<p><b>A Severely Flawed Study</b></p>
<p>Many parents believe that there are already too many vaccines, putting young children at the potential risk of autism and associated disorders. In a desperate bid to prove them wrong and to carry on the vaccination drive, researchers Dr. Frank DeStefano and his colleagues from the CDC (Centers for Disease Control) and Abt Associates published a fascinating paper in the <i>Journal of Pediatrics</i> in March of this year.</p>
<p>Their paper discussed whether or not a high number of vaccines administered at an early age caused autism. The researchers studied data from 256 children with autism and compared it to the data from 752 children without autism (born from 1994 –1999). All of the children studied came from three managed care facilities. The authors looked at each child’s cumulative exposure to antigens, the substances in vaccines that cause the body’s immune system to produce antibodies to fight disease, and the maximum number of antigens each child received in a single day of vaccination.</p>
<p>The paper states that researchers determined the total antigen numbers by adding the number of different antigens in all vaccines each child received in one day, as well as all vaccines each child received up to two years of age. They found that the total antigens from vaccines received by age two years and the maximum number received on a single day was the same between children with and without ASD (autism spectrum disorder).</p>
<p>The authors recognized that children receive more vaccines today then in the late 1990s and took this fact into consideration. However, they stated that vaccines in the late 1990s contained more antigens than they do today. The authors concluded that:</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>An infant’s immune system is capable of responding to a large amount of immunologic stimuli and, from time of birth, infants are exposed to hundreds of viruses and countless antigens outside of vaccination … The possibility that immunological stimulation from vaccines during the first 1 or 2 years of life could be related to the development of ASD is not well-supported by what is known about the neurobiology of ASDs. In 2004, a comprehensive review by the Institute of Medicine concluded that there is not a causal relationship between certain vaccine types and autism, and this study supports that conclusion. [3]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Why You Can’t Trust the CDC</b><br />
<a href="http://activistpost.net/vaccineexempt.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" class="noshadow" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-ndvYUapEn5A/TpHdZPRyqyI/AAAAAAAALS0/rUkfbJmy3o0/s240/vaccinexempt2.jpg" style="border: none"></a><br />
I found three major flaws with this study.</p>
<p><i>1. The number of children in each group is unbalanced.</i></p>
<p>How can a study of this caliber be fairly examined if the numbers of children taking part in each group are unequal?</p>
<p><i>2. There was no control group.</i></p>
<p>All reputable studies need a control group to compare the results with. For this study to be taken seriously researchers would need three groups of participants, the third group being a group of unvaccinated children.</p>
<p><i>3. There was no mention of genetics or whether any of the children suffered from an underlying condition that may have made them susceptible to adverse reactions.</i></p>
<p>In recent years researchers have determined that certain genetic disorders have the potential to cause children to react adversely to vaccines. An excellent example of how a genetic condition can affect a child receiving vaccines can be seen in the case of Hannah Polling. [4]</p>
<p>Hannah suffered from a mitochondrial disorder — a dysfunction in basic cell metabolism, which put her at increased risk of injury from vaccines, as determined by the vaccine court. The result of this condition combined with the vast amount of vaccines that Hannah received in one day was autism.</p>
<p><b>Experts Who Value Science More Than Profit</b></p>
<p>Professionals like Dr. Rebecca Carley, Dr. Viera Scheibner and psychologist Lisa Blakemore-Brown have been warning parents about the dangers of vaccines and their possible links to autism for many years.</p>
<p>Dr. Viera Scheibner, a retired principal research scientist with a doctorate in natural sciences, has been speaking on the dangers of vaccination since 1985. Dr. Scheibner has published three books and 90 scientific papers in prestigious scientific journals on the subject.</p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>Dr. Rebecca Carley was the first professional to recognize that there was a link between the MMR vaccination and the non-fatal form of SSPE, which she has been classifying as autism for the past fifteen years. Her professional opinions have been backed up scientifically as one hundred percent correct when government documents locked up for thirty years were recently uncovered, revealing that the government had discovered that the MMR vaccine was causing what they referred to as an SSPE like-syndrome.</p>
<p>Psychologist Lisa Blakemore-Brown has been speaking out since 1995 on the link among vaccines, autism and parents being falsely accused of Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy. She began to notice the link after she witnessed the parents of autistic children were being blamed for their children’s illnesses and disabilities as soon as they mentioned that their child/children became ill after they received a vaccine.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/vaccinetruth.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" height="175" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-38G3VOJQToQ/TfAZ2bc-qRI/AAAAAAAAJQ8/LA-TGAvVeWk/250x250-b.jpg" width="200"></a><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p>Governments are so determined to push vaccinations and reassure mothers that vaccines do not cause autism, they have come up with yet another flawed study to prove it. This effort is followed by a massive vaccination drive and media campaign to scare parents into accepting vaccines. Just to reassure parents further, the government is now encouraging the development of a vaccine to alleviate the symptoms of autism, just in case they are wrong. Really reassuring, isn’t it?</p>
<p>Here we have yet another example of just how desperate governments and the pharmaceutical industries are to protect the vaccination schedule. Instead of admitting that vaccinations are not only damaging the health of our children and that vaccines are totally ineffective at controlling diseases, governments get together with scientists to cash in on children’s suffering and develop yet another useless vaccine to cure the symptoms caused by the original vaccine.</p>
<p>Instead of wasting time developing more vaccinations, scientists, big pharma and governments would be better employed spending more time researching what professionals like Dr. Rebecca Carley, Dr. Viera Scheibner and psychologist Lisa Blakemore-Brown have been saying for years.</p>
<p><b>A Final Word From the Author</b></p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>As a mother of two autistic children, I would advise parents against using a vaccine to alleviate debilitating GI (gastrointestinal) disorders, which are often a symptom of autism. Paul Shattock, a leading expert from the Autism Research Unit, Sunderland University, and Dr. Ellowad, an expert in gastroenterology and child allergies, Great Ormond Street, both advise eliminating dairy and wheat from the diets of autistic children to help alleviate their problems. Their dietary advice not only helped me to manage my autistic son’s difficult behavior, but also completely cured the intense pain and chronic diarrhea he suffered as part of his disorder.</p>

<p><i>Christina was born and educated in London, U.K. She left school to work in a children’s library, specializing in story telling and book buying. In 1978 Christina changed her career path to dedicate her time to caring for the elderly and was awarded the title of Care Giver of the Year for her work with the elderly in 1980. In1990 she adopted the first of two disabled boys, both with challenging behavior, complex disabilities and medical needs. In 1999 she was accused of Munchausen by Proxy after many failed attempts to get the boys’ complex needs met. Finally, she was cleared of all accusations after the independent psychologist Lisa Blakemore-Brown gave both boys the diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder and ADHD as part of what she described to be a complex tapestry of disorders. During the assessments Ms Blakemore-Brown discovered through the foster care diaries that the eldest boy had reacted adversely to the MMR vaccine. After taking an A Level in Psychology and a BTEC in Learning Disabilities Ms. England spent many years researching vaccines and adverse reactions. She went on to gain a Higher National Diploma  in journalism and media and currently writes for the American Chronicle, the Weekly Blitz, VacTruth and Namaste Publishing UK on immunization safety and efficacy whilst continuing to study for a BA Honors degree in English Literature and Humanities. England’s main areas of expertise are researching false allegations of child abuse and adverse reactions to vaccines. Her work is read internationally and has been translated into many languages. Ms England has been a guest on many radio shows and has spoken at seminars worldwide. She is the co author to the book </i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Syndrome-Vaccine-Induced-Encephalitis-ebook/dp/B004OEKDMS/ref=sr_1_fkmr1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1355752412&amp;sr=8-2-fkmr1&amp;keywords=%C2%91Shaken+Baby+Syndrome+or+Vaccine+Induced+Encephalitis+%C2%96+Are+Parents+Being+Falsely+Accused%3F%C2%92"><i>‘</i><b>Shaken Baby Syndrome or Vaccine Induced Encephalitis – Are Parents Being Falsely Accused?’</b></a><i> with Dr Harold Buttram.</i></p>

<b><a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2013/11/8-life-changing-disasters.html">Activist Post</a></b></p>
<p>There are at least eight disasters that may soon change life as we know it, and seven of them are already underway. Most of these could cause an early death for millions.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, far too many people are unaware of how serious the situation is. They have the “normalcy bias,” the faulty assumption that normal will continue because it seems to have done so in the past. In actuality, “normal” has been changing throughout the entire life of each of us. </p>
<p>Sophisticated economic, political and social manipulation, the increased damage capabilities of war, widespread pollution and technologies from nukes to <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2013/08/the-dna-nanobots-have-arrived.html">nanobots</a> to death ray frequencies that raise the possibility for the end of all life on Earth. It all has made life very fragile and challenging in this era of humanity.</p>
<p>Beyond that, we must understand that there are elitist powers that control the finances, resources and technologies, and run the world’s institutions, that want the vast majority of us to be dead and gone. They think they don’t need us anymore. So they are not trying to prevent these disasters; they are causing or facilitating them.</p>
<p>There is little time to awaken as many people as possible to reality, so they can first protect themselves and their loved ones as much as possible, then work to prevent the worsening of these disasters that could yet unfold, and reverse the aspects in progress.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><b>1 – The Economic Disaster</b></p>
<p>The <a href="http://ticktricks.com/tick_econ.htm#The_Banking_System">international banksters</a> intended from the start of the United States of America to control the finances. It took them about a century to get their agents strategically planted. By fostering the Civil War and manipulating key officials in the aftermath, they got a strong foothold in Washington, D.C. that culminated in the implementation of the <a href="http://ticktricks.com/tick_econ.htm#The_Federal_Reserve_Bank">Federal Reserve</a> as a privately controlled central bank in 1913. </p>
<div align="center">

<p>
By allowing the bankers to freely issue our currency then lend it to the government at interest, as well as to businesses and individuals, coupled with the debasement of the dollar by divorcing it from gold and silver backing during the 20th Century, the “fiat” dollar has been reduced in value by 98% in 100 years. </p>
<p>The nation is so deep in debt that we are essentially owned by China, Japan and primarily the international banksters, headquartered in the City of London, Wall Street/D.C., The Vatican and Switzerland.</p>
<p>The mortgage fraud, the shaky derivatives market and the lessening status of the dollar as the world’s reserve currency and “petrodollar”, have the financial markets, big banks and even governments on the verge of collapse. If nothing worse, excessive <a href="http://ticktricks.com/tick_econ.htm#Inflation">inflation</a> in the U.S. is likely to ramp up very soon.</p>
<p>Warnings are being issued by a number of honest financial experts to minimize exposure in dollar-related assets, such as bank accounts, insurance, annuities, bonds and stocks. There could be a “haircut” tax in the U.S. on assets, as already done in some parts of Europe. In addition, pension funds of all types are vulnerable, including 401(k)s. Most recommend durable assets such as precious metals or land, or asset-backed  foreign currencies.</p>
<p>The Great Recession of the last five years could become what trends researcher and forecaster, <a href="http://trendsresearch.com/">Gerald Celente</a>, calls “the Greatest Depression”. Economic disaster is a major tool for the roll out of <a href="http://thenewworldorderempire.com/">The New World Order Empire</a>.</p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p><b>2 – The Food Disaster</b></p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/backyardliberty.html" rel="nofollow" style="float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-S6RfjP7Lvo8/USlEmRqWjJI/AAAAAAAAUgk/Zio_5z2T_gE/s200/prep.gif"></a>The health of a population is tied to the quality of their food and the richness of their agricultural soil. The Standard American Diet (SAD) has worsened even as understanding of <a href="http://reallywell.com/wellness.htm">natural health and nutrition</a> has grown over the last century.</p>
<p>Giant agribusiness and food product manufacturers control most of the food supply, with motives of high profit and poor health. The corporate interests guide the consumer to the medical establishment and early death with deteriorating health.</p>
<p>The introduction of heavy reliance on chemical farming methods after World War II, has caused further erosion of the mineral values of our soils and thus the quality of our crops. Weaker plants are more susceptible, so there has been increased use of toxic herbicides and pesticides, and more recently <a href="http://survivethechanges.com/earth_changes.htm#GMO">Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs)</a>, all of which are unhealthy for consumption by people and animals.</p>
<p>Further, the expansion of fast food and junk food as a share of the dietary intake, with all the chemical additives for flavor, color and preservation, has the public consuming a lot of chemicals with not enough good nutrients. The bogus replacement of natural nutritional elements with synthetic lab substitutes is also not good for health.</p>
<p>Meanwhile through techniques of weather control, extremes of drought and flooding, and through manipulation by officials around the world, food supplies are little available to many. Starvation and severe malnourishment diseases, combined with chemicals are being used in the Third World as a faster method of population reduction, than the more subtle method of shortening life with just poor nutrition and chemical toxins that has been employed by the power controllers in modern techno-industrial societies. They now seem to be getting ready to try increasing the death levels with a combination of disasters, including an expanded food availability crisis.</p>
<p><b>3 – The Health Disaster</b></p>
<p>The SAD diet in conjunction with purposeful <a href="http://publicpoisons.com/">public poisons</a>, including all the chemicals in foods, the chlorine and fluoride in water and the routine spraying of chemicals in the air as part of <a href="http://chemtrailer.com/">atmospheric aerosol geoengineering (“chemtrails”)</a>, all this has undermined good health for many people. <a href="http://reallywell.com/index.htm#Common_Health_Problems">Degenerative diseases</a> that few should have if educated, are very common.</p>
<p>The solutions offered by the pharmaceutically controlled medical establishment have made health much worse. From <a href="http://reallywell.com/no_vaccinations.htm">vaccinations</a> to daily drugs, the health of most of the population has been compromised by this industry.</p>
<p>As a result, people’s <a href="http://reallywell.com/immune.htm">immune strength</a> is weakened and far too many are susceptible to whatever <a href="http://survivethechanges.com/social_changes.htm#Pandemic">pandemic</a> might make the rounds. There are severe viruses and bacteria that have been developed as bio-weapons, and some of these may be used as another tool of massive population eradication by pandemic.</p>
<p><b>4 – The Mental Disaster</b></p>
<p>Ignorance, distraction, mass hypnosis, misinformation and staged events such as war, were the primary <a href="http://ticktricks.com/psyence.html">mind control</a> tools of the powers that be until technologies made it so much easier for them.</p>
<p>Several of the widespread chemical poisons, including fluoride, aluminum, mercury and psychotropic medicines, facilitate reduced intelligence, mass apathy and mind control.</p>
<p>Movies, radio and television have allowed the controllers to reach the masses with powerful manipulative messages, both apparent and hidden. Television itself is a means of hypnotic entrainment.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/teslasecret/" rel="nofollow" style="float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" class="noshadow" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/_qLAIskTQXUc/TaqAcrCPlhI/AAAAAAAAISQ/5uq527jnmDM/book-shape.jpg" style="border: none"></a>The educational system was taken over long ago. Public schools were set up for training compliant corporate workers. Only the basics of a few subjects are offered, with much disinformation. Simultaneously, the institutions of higher learning were reorganized influenced by outside funding to center research and emphases around global corporate interests.</p>
<p>After years of development stemming from Nikola Tesla’s insights, Nazi experiments and further secret research programs, psychotronic frequencies are now employed to manipulate minds. RFID chips, cell phone towers, <a href="http://www.haarp.net/">HAARP</a>, nanobots, ELF waves, psychotronic weapons, “silent sound”, “voice to skull”, etc., these terms are the vocabulary of not only today’s surveillance technologies, but also of controlling thoughts, feelings and behavior with <a href="http://ticktricks.com/psyence.html#Electromagnetic%20Control">electromagnetic methods</a>.</p>
<p><b>5 – The Social Disaster</b></p>
<p>Another of the “<a href="http://www.stopthecrime.net/docs/SILENT.pdf">Secret Weapons For Quiet Wars</a>” planned by the power elite has been the deterioration of the cities in Western societies. Trapping much of the poor and less educated in urban centers, then removing the job base to foreign lands, has created a vast dependency on government programs.</p>
<p>Distraction of the masses with fashion, celebrities, sports, personal technologies, mind warping games, drugs, crime, police actions, etc., keep people from paying much attention to the larger picture.</p>
<p>Big news false flag events are used to justify gradually increasing security measures, which many accept as necessary. Those who recognize and point out the hidden protocols such as <a href="http://ticktricks.com/Agenda_21.htm">Agenda 21</a> and other steps toward <a href="http://ticktricks.com/plans.htm">an emerging restrictive social system under global control</a>, are marginalized. </p>
<p>It appears that the <a href="http://ticktricks.com/tricks.htm">illegitimate fraudsters</a> running the show have prepared the agencies they run for imposition of <a href="http://survivethechanges.com/social_change.htm#Martial%20Law">martial law</a>, as the resistance they have fostered among those who are awakening has grown. Being restricted to your residence with limited if any travel, and possibly rationed food and water, would be very different from the accustomed lifestyle. Even worse would be everyone being transported to barracks at a camp.</p>
<p><b>6 – The Nuclear Disaster</b></p>
<p>The Fukushima <a href="http://survivethechanges.com/earth_changes.htm#Nuclear%20Disaster">nuclear catastrophe</a> is the worst one yet. Radioactivity continues to spill into the ocean and travel around the globe through the air. The Northern Hemisphere is being increasingly contaminated, especially the north Pacific and the west coast of North America.</p>
<p>Over 1,300 used fuel rods are stored at Fukushima in a facility that is breaking down. Shortly, they plan to start moving these rods one at a time. If one rod drops, breaks or touches another, a nuclear fire or explosion could be generated that could start a chain reaction through all of these rods, even possibly effecting the rest of the reported 11,000 total rods located at this multiple reactor site. </p>
<p>If the Fukushima disaster is multiplied, life in the Northern Hemisphere may not be possible any longer. There are leaking nuclear plants in the U.S., too. These aging facilities are also vulnerable to natural disaster or to various types of attack.</p>

A disaster could come by missiles from without, set explosions from within, or by cyber-attack.</p>
<p>We are already being radiated from <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2013/10/something-is-killing-life-all-over.html">Fukushima</a>. An additional nuclear event could make that much worse.

<p><b>7 – The Earth Changes Disaster</b></p>
<p>You may not know that the levels of <a href="http://survivethechanges.com/earth_changes.htm#Earthquakes%20&amp;%20Volcanoes">earthquakes, volcanic activities,</a> <a href="http://survivethechanges.com/earth_changes.htm#Sinkholes,%20Fireballs%20&amp;%20Booms">sinkholes and fire balls</a> are raising concerns among many observers. Some these have caused serious disruption of lives, but there has not been much news coverage since the earthquake and tsunami destroyed much of northern Japan in 2011.</p>
<p>A major volcanic eruption could affect most of the world with ash dust emissions. Protecting one’s respiratory system would be essential. It is possible for a global dust cloud to cause a year or more of winter, interrupting crop production and forcing starvation for many.</p>

</div>
<p>Many other natural disasters, including storms, high winds, tornadoes, floods, drought, wild fires, extreme temperatures, deep snow and ice have damaged crops and homes and caused people great difficulties.</p>
<p>The Earth’s poles have been moving in recent years. Some think that we are near a major <a href="http://survivethechanges.com/earth_changes.htm#Polar%20Shift">polar shift</a>. Several prognosticators warn of major geographic changes. </p>
<p>At the same time, the sun’s activity has been abnormal. This is supposed to be a solar maximum period, but the sun has been less active than expected, yet once in a while it generates a massive coronal mass ejection (CME). If one of these comes right at Earth, we could have a major problem.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="http://survivethechanges.com/planetx.htm#Comet%20Ison">Comet Ison</a> approaches, which may have significant electromagnetic effects on the sun and/or Earth as it travels near over the next couple of months and goes around the sun in January. Some are concerned about meteors falling from a debris field trailing the Comet, as Earth moves through its path in January.</p>
<p>Whatever the cause, a powerful geophysical event could suddenly make life very different on this planet. </p>
<p><b>8 – The Power Outage Disaster</b></p>
<p>A solar coronal mass ejection is one way an <a href="http://survivethechanges.com/earth_changes.htm#EMP%20Damage%20To%20The%20Power%20Grid">Electro-Magnetic Pulse (EMP)</a> could be generated that affects the power grid and communications on Earth. A nuclear explosion high in the atmosphere, or the use of a high tech weapon that can generate an EMP, are other ways the power could be shut down. It is known that enemies of the U.S. have developed such capabilities.</p>
<p>It is expected that an EMP would fry the power grid’s transformers as well as communications satellites. The power grid is so interconnected that an EMP could wipe out power for much or all of the continent. Another threat to this vulnerable system is a <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2013/10/report-massive-vulnerability-detected.html">cyber-attack</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/stirlinggenerator.html" rel="nofollow" style="float: left;margin-bottom: 0em;margin-right: 1em"><img alt="" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-SbIE0rIxRZ4/UI2UX68rH4I/AAAAAAAASRc/FdTl9uKm_Kk/s200/1267117.gif"></a>For some reason, legislation passed in the U.S. House of Representatives to strengthen our power grid was shelved in the Senate. Several government officials have warned that it is just a matter of time before a power shutdown occurs. Multiple agencies and companies across North America are planning a <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2013/10/you-should-have-expected-us-series-of.html">drill around a major power outage scenario</a> for November 13-14.</p>
<p>When the power is out, your lights and heating system are not the only things that will not be working; there will be no water or fuel being pumped, refrigerators and freezers will not work, ATMs will be off, and stores and restaurants will probably be closed. It is anticipated that the digital devices in modern vehicles might be wiped out by an EMP, such that cars would stop running. In a few days, society would be in serious disturbance. </p>
<p>A recent <a href="http://goingglobaleastmeetswest.blogspot.com/2013/10/american-blackout-2013-national.html">television movie</a> and <a href="http://www.survivetheblackout.com/">website depiction</a> of a just a 10-day power outage scenario by National Geographic suggests how problematic this would be.</p>
<p>Some are saying that the TV and website programs about this, together with the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/17/us/as-worries-over-the-power-grid-rise-a-drill-will-simulate-a-knockout-blow.html?ref=matthewlwald&amp;_r=0">power outage drill</a> and the warnings by public officials are “predictive programming” for a power down situation known to be coming.</p>
<p><b>Preparation Is Needed</b></p>
<p>There is little time left to <a href="http://survivethechanges.com/preparedness.htm">prepare</a> as well as possible. A power outage is the only one of these eight disasters that is not already in progress, but the possibility of is very real. I have suggested that people form a support community with nearby family, friends and neighbors. It is important to take immediate action to plan for provisions, security and survival, gather supplies and build any shelters deemed appropriate.</p>

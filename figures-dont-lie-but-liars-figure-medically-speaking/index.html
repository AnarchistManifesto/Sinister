<p>By <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/search/label/Catherine%20Frompovich">Catherine J. Frompovich</a></p>
<p>From very early on in life, everyone learns how important math is, especially that one and one equal two, not three or even two-and-a-half!  However, when it comes to statistics and other mathematical markers for business, industry, and even science, numbers sometimes belie the reality of the facts, depending upon who wants to prove what, and to whom. </p>
<p>Recently, I’ve been thinking about the cost of healthcare—or is it sickness care—in the United States, and how it’s been escalating despite the purported advances in medical science and even the outlandish contention that vaccines can help to reduce sickness and its costs by improving, what’s euphemistically called, ‘herd immunity’.  </p>
<p><a name="more"></a>Let’s get one thing accurate: I don’t consider myself—or any person—to be a member of any animal herd. I’m a human being with intelligence and unalienable rights granted by the very act of my being born with those implicit rights every person comes into life with: Life, which includes being able to breathe air, drink water, and eat food to maintain health and bodily functions; liberty—the very essence of freedom, i.e., to be free from control mechanisms by individuals, spouses, family or friends, and most of all, by governments, especially those referred to as dictatorial; and <i><b>happiness</b></i>, a state of being that depends upon many contributing factors, which some humans can control and others that we cannot, but definitely impact our very lives, often in ways we always can’t clearly understand or define. </p>
<p>One overarching mechanism affecting everyone in the United States, at least, is bureaucratic control and its dictates, along with an apparent belief that government owns our children, our wealth, and even our bodies!  What leads me to such a conclusion?  Nothing is more demonstrable than how healthcare with all its ancillary aspects operates with dogmatic and dictatorial force of law, regardless of an individual’s right to self-determination given to him or her as an inherent birthright. </p>

<p>The above is a prelude to juxtapose against just how U.S. citizens are manipulated into demographics that no one could have imagined, especially that <i><b>healthcare in the USA is now over Three Trillion Dollars a YEAR!</b></i>  And yet, the USA does not have the best healthcare statistics!  One would think with that kind of money spent, we’d be the healthiest people on the face of the earth.  Not so!  Guess who are? </p>
<p><i>Forbes Magazine</i> ranked Iceland as having the healthiest people in the world! [1]   Having visited Iceland for one glorious week in the mid-1980s, I can understand why.  Their food back then, at least, was pristine and restaurants were not put out when my late husband and I requested vegetarian meals.  They were only too happy to accommodate us with magnificently prepared vegetarian food. </p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>Japan ranked second as the healthiest country, primarily due to its ages-old-diet fashioned around fresh sea vegetables, seafood, rice and veggies.  That, no doubt, will change due to Fukushima radiation that has contaminated land and sea, plus the invasion of western culture ‘cuisine’. </p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/noglasses.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-XGeeizTmcTk/VQ2jJdxGGMI/AAAAAAAABYg/F1_oE38Oq0k/s220/8.jpg"></a>Sweden ranked third.  Okinawa, a prefecture of Japan, ranked fourth. New Zealand came in fifth, and Sardinia, an autonomous region of Italy, came in sixth.  Those were the rankings back in 2012 and reflected healthful living due to long-established eating patterns in those countries. [2]   </p>
<p>The USA, as a nation, has one of the most abominable dietary ‘styles’: greasy fast food fare, GMO and processed edibles, and too many unhealthful fats, sugars, and starches with very little fresh vegetables.</p>
<p>In June of 2014, <i>Forbes </i>published <i><b>“U.S. Healthcare Ranked Dead Last Compared to 10 Other Countries”</b></i> [3] wherein the following rankings for the top ten countries, according to the Commonwealth Fund, were: </p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>
1. United Kingdom<br />
2. Switzerland<br />
3. Sweden           <br />
4. Australia<br />
5. Germany &amp; Netherlands (tied)<br />
7. New Zealand &amp; Norway (tied)<br />
9. France<br />
10. Canada<br />
11. United States </p>

<p><b>The chart below illustrates the per capita costs in 2011 for each of the above 11 countries.</b></p>

<p>What really gets interesting, I think, is that U.S. healthcare expenditures average $8,508 per person compared with Australia’s $3,800 per person—and both are high-tech countries.  The UK spends $3,405 person, but ranks first in every category on the above chart except three!  The only ‘high marks’ the U.S. received were a “3 for effective care” and a “4 for patient-centered care”. Interestingly, the UK skunked just about every nation listed except in “Healthy Lives, where it ranked 10.”  France ranked No. 1 in Healthy Lives! Ooh-la-la!  Having spent some time in most of France, I can attest as to why that is:  Food there tastes like nothing back in the USA.  When we returned from having spent several weeks in most of France, our taste buds became paralyzed eating fresh-grown U.S. vegetables.  The French respect their food, at least when I was there.  As far as Healthy Lives, the U.S. ranked 11! </p>
<p><i>Forbes </i>was keen to point out that Starbucks spends more on healthcare benefits ($300 Million [5]) than it does on coffee beans—ouch!, and General Motors spent more on healthcare benefits [$1,525 per car produced [4]) than steel—unbelievable! </p>
<p>For healthcare costs and statistics for the years 2010 (WHO) and 2011 (OECD), I suggest readers check out <i>Wikipedia’s</i> charts at <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_total_health_expenditure_(PPP)_per_capita/">“List of countries by total healthcare expenditure (PPP) per capita”</a>.</b> </p>
<p>In 2010, U.S. healthcare costs represented 17.6% of the GDP (Gross Domestic Product) per WHO on the <i>Wikipedia </i>chart.  But take a look at the GDP figures in my next paragraph.  Something doesn’t seem to jive!  Did healthcare costs go down between 2010 and 2012?  I don’t think so!  So, what gives with the figures, anyway?  Are we being told the mathematical truth?  Do figures lie, or liars figure? </p>
<p>According to <i>The Washington Times</i>, </p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>
By 2023, health care spending will account for nearly a fifth of annual GDP, at 19.3 percent, up                 from 17.2 percent in 2012. [6] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, the apparent fact is that United States, with its Trillion Dollar healthcare scheme [7], came in at No. 11 when compared to other countries.  As a retired consulting nutritionist, I’m embarrassed to have to write that number.  But here’s where the figures start to muddy up more than we realize.  Study the chart below, which graphically illustrates the number of vaccines that were given to children under 5 years of age AND compares the <i><b>under-5-years-of-age-mortality-rate</b></i> from 2009 statistics.</p>

One ironic statistic that jumps off that chart is that of the countries with comparative vaccine schedules, <b>the U.S. had—<i>and probably still has</i>—the highest child mortality rate coinciding with the highest mandated vaccine rate: 36 vaccines that were given to children under 5 years of age in 2009!</b>  What’s SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome) all about?  That seemed to appear more frequently after the vaccine mandates of the 1980s. </p>
<p>Here’s the current CDC vaccine schedule for <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/parents/downloads/parent-ver-sch-0-6yrs.pdf">children up to 6 years of age</a>.  Count the number of vaccines given under current ‘recommendations’.</p>
<p>In the above chart, the countries with the lower number of vaccines given to children also had lower child mortality rates.  What does that indicate?  Was it coincidence?  No, I don’t think so. </p>
<p>Can higher child death rate along with highest per capita healthcare spending, plus exorbitant GDP, indicate that the U.S. is doing something terribly wrong with regard to healthcare, and that citizens are NOT benefiting? </p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>Are vaccines being ‘patient loaded’ on the front end of life [newborns, infants, and toddlers] with U.S. children whose autism rate went from one in 10,000 in the late 1970s to one in 68 or one in 50 [depending upon whose current stats one cites] to ‘patient loading’ the back end of life, senior citizens who had hardly any notable Alzheimer’s disease statistics in 1979 to over 5 million currently? </p>
<p>However, there is something to corroborate the above comment. It’s the statistics per the U.S. CDC for 1979 to 1991that were charted in Figure 2 on page 11 of <b>“Mortality Trends for Alzheimer’s Disease, 1979-91”</b> [9], which shows that <b>in 1979 for seniors aged 65 to 74 years old, there was  1.0 Alzheimer’s death per 100,000 population.</b> [7]  </p>
<p><b>Table B of that very same report states that in 1990—only 10 to 11 years later, 65 to 74 year old Alzheimer’s deaths were 10.2 per 100,000 population.  That’s over ten times an increase in Alzheimer’s disease in a decade. </b></p>
<p>If we look at the chart in Figure 2 for 1991 for 85 and older persons, there were under 200 deaths, if I interpreted the line graph correctly.  Table B states 176.5 deaths per 100,000.  For 95 years and older, it skyrockets to 319.6 Alzheimer deaths per 100,000 population.  </p>
<p>Now, here’s the most incriminating factor affecting those statistics: Senior citizens in those age categories most likely have been residing in assisted living or some other structured medical care or community living facility that requires, and routinely delivers, annual flu and pneumococcal vaccines that are loaded with toxins and/or aluminum!  It must be noted that aluminum is strongly implicated in numerous dementias [13] and Alzheimer’s disease, too. </p>
<p>Table B of the above CDC report confirms: </p>

<p>Now, to elucidate further, here are the unfortunate, explosive and financial-impacting Alzheimer’s statistics snowballing from 1979 at 1.0 per 100,000 population to these current disastrous statistics: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>1-in-9 Americans over 65</b> has Alzheimer’s disease. (Alzheimer’s Association)</li>
<li>When the first wave of baby boomers reaches age 85 (in 2031), it is projected that more than 3 million people age 85 and older will have Alzheimer’s. (Alzheimer’s Association)</li>
<li>
<b>One-third of Americans over age 85 </b>are afflicted with the illness. (Alzheimer’s Association)</li>
<li>
<b>5.3 million Americans</b> are living with Alzheimer’s disease. (Alzheimer’s Association)</li>
<li>Unless a cure is found, more than <b>16 million</b> Americans will have the disease by 2050. (Alzheimer’s Association)</li>
<li>Alzheimer’s disease is the <b>6th leading cause of death</b> in America. (Centers for Disease Control) [10] </li>
</ul>
<p>So, how much do figures lie or do liars figure?  That’s something each individual has to sort out for him- or herself because the numbers, in reality, are telling us important information, especially that there may be causation with correlation—something all of medicine—and especially federal health agencies—refuse to investigate, especially regarding vaccines.  Why? </p>
<p><b>Mathematical anomalies, I contend, have been demonstrated in the above statistics. </b></p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/vaccineexempt.html" rel="nofollow" style="float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" class="noshadow" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-ndvYUapEn5A/TpHdZPRyqyI/AAAAAAAALS0/rUkfbJmy3o0/s240/vaccinexempt2.jpg" style="border: none"></a>However, vaccine loading infants and children at the beginning of life and senior citizens during their sunset years of life probably plays a more ‘significant’ role in healthcare costs than we are led to believe, and maybe for more reasons than one.  Furthermore, could mandatory vaccine loading be the rationale for:  a) more than 300 vaccines in the developmental pipeline and, b) mandating that everyone in the USA receive all booster shots regardless of age? [15]   Tremendous sums of money are to be made by vaccine manufacturers from vaccine sales, plus—and this has to be understood for what it represents—excise taxes on all vaccines that go to the U.S. Treasury. </p>
<p><b>Vaccines are not without their adverse reactions, even long-term health effects, which negatively will impact the ever-rising costs of healthcare/sickness care in the USA. </b></p>
<p>As an example, let’s see what the <i><b>MMR-II vaccine</b></i> can cause, as per <a href="http://www.merck.com/product/usa/pi_circulars/m/mmr_ii/mmr_ii_pi.pdf">pages 6 and 7 of the vaccine package insert for MMR-II.</a>  </p>

<p>Arthralgia and/or arthritis (usually transient and rarely chronic), and polyneuritis are features of infection with wild-type rubella and vary in frequency and severity with age and sex, being         greatest in adult females and least in prepubertal children.

<p>Chronic arthritis has been associated with wild-type rubella infection and has been related to persistent virus and/or viral antigen isolated from body tissues. Only rarely have vaccine              recipients developed chronic joint symptoms. </p>
<p>Following vaccination in children, reactions in joints are uncommon and generally of brief             duration. In women, incidence rates for arthritis and arthralgia are generally higher than those           seen in children (children: 0-3%; women: 12-26%),{17,56,57} and the reactions tend to be more         marked and of longer duration. Symptoms may persist for a matter of months or on rare    occasions for years. In adolescent girls, the reactions appear to be intermediate in incidence            between those seen in children and in adult women.

Here are <a href="http://www.immunize.org/packageinserts/pi_measles.asp">the package inserts for vaccines</a> so readers can learn what possibly can happen to increase the costs of healthcare once vaccine adverse reactions occur.  But, obviously, no one is considering their impacts on healthcare costs, human suffering and, especially, how to prevent that from happening. </p>
<p>Regardless the reason(s) for vaccine dictates, there’s <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2015/02/forced-adult-vaccinations-at-federal.html">a new HHS/CDC mandate</a> coming that everyone—irrespective of age—must be vaccinated with children’s booster shots! [15]   How much do you think the cost of healthcare in the U.S. will increase as a result of that fiasco?  Healthcare costs, I predict, probably will skirt 30% to 40% GDP very soon.  We have to prevent that from happening.  Why? There probably will be very few efficient and healthy workers available who will be able to make the country function as a viable nation and trading partner in the global economy.  </p>

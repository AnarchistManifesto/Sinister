            <div style="text-align: justify;">Do Women Have The Right Of Free Choice (Pro Choice)? Do Women Control Their Own Bodies? Planned Parenthood Witch Hunt Around Birth Control And Abortion Rights, Survey For Birth Control/Abortion; Why Is God Pro Choice Around Abortion?&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">First of all, everyone is pro life. Everyone loves children. Everyone is pro family. Asking people if they are pro life does not answer any critical questions around legality or illegality of &nbsp;birth control or abortion. More precise survey questions might consist of:</p>
<h3>SURVEY QUESTIONS TO ASK AROUND BIRTH CONTROL AND ABORTION</h3>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">1. Should a child be FORCED to be brought into the world if a single child, teen or adult parent or even two parents are not ready either financially, emotionally or in other ways, for any number of very valid reasons?</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">2. Should girls, teens and/or adult single/married women be forced to have sex without birth control, and with no way to either prevent or end a pregnancy legally, due to extreme right wing religion believing that ANY AND ALL birth control methods are the equivalent of murder?</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<p>3. Should women have the right to have a choice and voice in matters that affect their bodies, such as birth control, and whether to have a child or not, or should they be forced into using&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsafe_abortion" target="_blank">back alley illegal abortions and illegal birth control method</a>s?</p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">4. Should a particular religion or religious leader such as an Imam or Pope be 100% in charge of women&#8217;s choices around their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_conversion#Christianity" target="_blank">choice of religion</a>, sex, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsafe_abortion" target="_blank">birth control and whether to have a baby or not</a>?</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">5. Should America go back to The Pope or a British King being in charge and declaring absolute power and authority, as a God on Earth and then <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsafe_abortion" target="_blank">prohibiting birth control and/or abortions</a>?</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">6. Assume birth control and abortion is made completely illegal and has been banned absolutely on a global basis. How long would it take to overpopulate the Earth, and cause mass starvation, environmental destruction plus wars over shrinking resources such as water and food, due to huge increases in birth rates from lack of access to birth control/abortion? 10 years or less, 20 years, 30 years, 50 or more years?</p>
<p>7. Should women who use birth control or abortion services, including the morning after pill be punished by prosecuting them and throwing them into jail for long periods of time?&nbsp;</p></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">David Suzuki And Ted Turner Warn About Global Overpopulation And Earth&#8217;s Carrying Capacity Being Exceeded by 300 Percent</div>
</div>
<div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://agreenroad.blogspot.com/2013/10/david-suzuki-and-ted-turner-warn-us.html">http://agreenroad.blogspot.com/2013/10/david-suzuki-and-ted-turner-warn-us.html</a></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">8. Assuming either abortion and/or birth control methods are made illegal and organizations such as Planned Parenthood are also abolished, what punishment would be appropriate for women who use birth control or have abortions illegally? Should they be charged and convicted of murder?</p>
<p>9. How should women be punished? Should women convicted under this new law banning both birth control and abortion, be put to death if they have been found guilty of attempting to use birth control or have an abortion?</p></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Fetal Murder, Fetal Homicide; Abortion Is Being Made Illegal And Punishable By Murder Charges, War On Women And Planned Parenthood Continues &#8211; Rain Without Thunder Movie</div>

</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">10. Are you in favor of teaching sex education to young teens who are becoming sexually active? Currently, there is no agreement in US schools whether to teach anything, something or even make it science based. Right now, many schools teach ONLY complete sexual abstinence until marriage, but provide no information on birth control methods.</p>
<p>11. Is God pro choice?&nbsp;</p></div>
<div></div>
<p>Sex Education; Last Week Tonight with John Oliver (HBO) Education Around Sex Is Chaotic, Governed By Religion, Censored In Schools</p></div>

<div></div>
<p>How would you answer these questions?</p>
<h3>GOD IS PRO CHOICE, AS THE MAJORITY OF FERTILIZED EGGS NEVER EVEN IMPLANT IN THE UTERUS</h3>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_abortion_in_humans">rationalwiki</a> &#8220;A common <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Fundamentalist">fundamentalist</a> argument against <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Abortion">abortion</a> is that each human being is granted a <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Soul">soul</a> at the moment of conception, and that destroying that &#8220;soul&#8221; is equivalent to murder. Taking this logic further, the argument is that most methods of <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Birth_control">birth control</a> are equivalent to mass murder with the exception of condoms or other barrier types.</div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-S-F5-DpsqZ4/WrWGnBNg2CI/AAAAAAABl8M/JqF0_Ksjn_wufv-Vf7HajgIwjEXxCeA6ACLcBGAs/s1600/god%2Bis%2Bpro%2Bchoice%2Bmiscarriage%2Babortion%2BRude%2Band%2BRotten%2BRepublicans.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="522" data-original-width="733" height="454" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-S-F5-DpsqZ4/WrWGnBNg2CI/AAAAAAABl8M/JqF0_Ksjn_wufv-Vf7HajgIwjEXxCeA6ACLcBGAs/s640/god%2Bis%2Bpro%2Bchoice%2Bmiscarriage%2Babortion%2BRude%2Band%2BRotten%2BRepublicans.png" width="640" /></a></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Few conceptions lead to a baby</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">However, there&#8217;s some serious problems with the logic of ensoulation at the point of conception. The CDC as well as the March of Dimes and several fertility experts have conducted studies to see exactly how hard it is to carry a pregnancy to term. In general, less than 70% of all fertilized eggs will even implant into the mother&#8217;s womb causing pregnancy to continue <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_abortion_in_humans#cite_note-1">[1]</a>. From there, there is a 25-50% chance of aborting before you even know you are pregnant. If, however, you make it to your first month, your odds go up to 75% chance of carrying to term. So if you look at it from the fundamentalist point of view, all those little souls are being given a home, only to be miscarried before they even know they are alive.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Scientific research has compiled the following information about the rates of naturally aborted pregnancies in human beings (or, if you believe everything happens for a reason, pregnancies aborted by God himself).</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">This chart assumes that 200 eggs are in an environment with sperm nearby.<a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_abortion_in_humans#cite_note-2">[2]</a></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_abortion_in_humans" target="_blank">https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_abortion_in_humans</a></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Bottom line, &#8216;abortions&#8217; and miscarriages are carried out &#8216;naturally&#8217; by God, without any human intervention. Should God be charged with murder and then punished?&nbsp;</div>
<p></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">THE HISTORY OF WOMEN&#8217;S RIGHTS FOR THOSE WHO DID NOT GET THIS IN SCHOOL OR COLLEGE; WHICH IS MANY TO MOST PEOPLE</h3>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Remember, it was not too many years ago, that women were considered the &#8216;property&#8217; of men and nothing more. Not too long ago, in America, women could not vote, own property and had no rights in court, just like African American slaves.</p>

<div style="text-align: justify;">Women got the right to be equal to men, and the right to vote. Women got the right to own property and women got the right to control their own bodies.</p>
<p>Will they give up these rights? If the above video is any hint, women will not give up even one of these rights without a fight..</p>
<p>Good luck to those trying to wage a war on women, you will most likely feel their wrath&#8230;&nbsp;</p></div>
<p></p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">If you are a woman and you want to ban abortion, by all means keep voting for the Republican party representatives, because they are all about that these days, even if they claim to be the opposite before they get elected.</p>
<p>Donald Trump has a position of putting in place Supreme Court justices that will overturn Roe Vs Wade, and institute a ban on all abortions, plus punish women if they try to have an abortion, via trials, convictions, and jail sentences.&nbsp;</p></div>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">HARRIS OPINION POLL INDICATES 56 PERCENT OF AMERICANS ARE IN FAVOR OF A WOMAN&#8217;S FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO FREEDOM OF CHOICE</h3>
<div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">It seems like a no brainer that women should be able to choose, but 40 percent believe that women should NOT have this right. Well, if women cannot choose for themselves, then who will choose for them? A religion? A government? Maybe a religious government controlled by a fundamentalist religious leader, such as the Pope, or an Islamic Imam will choose for women. Which way do you prefer it to be?</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">Should America go back to The Pope or a British King being in charge and declaring absolute power and authority, as a God on Earth? Maybe this is a better way to ask the question, to make the choice more clear. That is the fundamental choice, and it seems 40% of Americans want someone in charge with absolute power, and women should not have the right to choose.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Wikipedia; &#8220;In 1973, the U.S. Supreme Court decided that states laws which made it illegal for a woman to have an abortion up to three months of pregnancy were unconstitutional, and that the decision on whether a woman should have an abortion up to three months of pregnancy should be left to the woman and her doctor to decide. In general, do you favor or oppose this part of the U.S. Supreme Court decision making abortions up to three months of pregnancy legal?<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade#cite_note-Lowest-79">[79]</a>&nbsp;</b></div>

<h3>PREGNANCY STATISTICS IN US</h3>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">In the US, Almost 350,000 U.S. teenagers under the age of 18 become pregnant each year. Approximately 82% of these pregnancies are unintended. Fifty-five percent of pregnant teenagers give birth, 14% have miscarriages, and 31% have abortions. (The Alan Guttmacher Institute (AGI), Special Report: U.S. Teenage Pregnancy Statistics: With Comparative Statistics for Women Aged 20-24 (1999).) The House just passed a bill to rob a woman of her access to abortions by taking away insurance coverage – on the anniversary of Roe v. Wade.&nbsp;What a dark day for women’s rights in America.</div>

<h3>PRO LIFE ADVOCATES DON&#8217;T BELIEVE IN BIRTH CONTROL, OR FERTILITY TREATMENTS, AND &nbsp;BELIEVE BIBLE SHOULD BE APPLIED LITERALLY, EVEN IF THAT MEANS RAPING WOMEN AS PUNISHMENT</h3>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Pro life advocates such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_literalism" target="_blank">Literalists</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominion_Theology" target="_blank">Dominionists</a>&nbsp;and/or&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christofascism" target="_blank">Christofascists</a> feel strongly that no girl or woman should have the right to make choices about her own body, and that both birth control and abortion should be made illegal and immoral, as it was in the 1800&#8217;s and before..</p>
<p>These groups don&#8217;t believe in birth control, the morning after pill, nor fertility treatments to have a baby such as IVF. Some pro life advocates feel so strongly about this issue that they are willing to commit violence. including even murder, lying to pregnant women and/or committing arson or property destruction.</p>

Are they in favor of rape?</p>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Many if not most of these abortion foes also don&#8217;t believe in teaching birth control or having classes at school that teach anything about how the body works or how sex results in pregnancy.</p>
<p>The result of no sex education classes and no birth control ends up causing the huge teen pregnancy problem, which then results in an abortion issue, especially in predominantly fundamentalist Catholic countries where laws and policies against abortion, birth control and sex education are commonplace.</p>

<h3>IN VITRO FERTILIZATION IS LIKE KILLING CHILDREN, SO IT WAS BANNED IN COSTA RICA, DUE TO FUNDAMENTALIST CHURCHES PRESSURING GOVERNMENT TO PUT RELIGIOUS DOGMA INTO GOVERNMENT</h3>
</div>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">In Costa Rica, a Catholic lawyer convinced a court to ban IVF in 2000, because IVF was &#8216;killing children&#8217;. Never mind that the couples wanted children but could not have them without IVF. In the pro life country of Costa Rica, the ironic thing is that married couples who want to have children, and they can only accomplish this via IVF, are not allowed to do so. What happened to the rights of the couple who WANT a child, but are prevented from doing so, by church dogma, translated into law?&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">On the flip side, what happens to the rights of couples or singles, who DON&#8217;T want children, and thus use birth control methods such as condoms, foam, diaphram, or the morning after pill. If all of these things are made illegal, not only will the birth rate rise astronomically, the heavy weight and footprint plus consequences of over population will make the survival of the human race even more unlikely.&nbsp;</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">Electing extreme right wing fundamentalists like Santorum into office turns into public policy such things as abstinence and not talking about sex, instead of teaching sex education and providing birth control methods, which actually work, as opposed to just say no campaigns, while keeping teens ignorant, and staying with a policy that does not work at all.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Electing right wing fundamentalists will also result in overturning Roe vs Wade, by putting extreme right wing judges into the Supreme Court. Be careful who you vote for, because you will get what you ask for. And if you don&#8217;t vote, the passionate minority made up of extreme right wing fundamentalists, will get their candidate into office, because they ALL VOTE.</div>

<h3>ROE VS WADE GAVE WOMEN THE POWER OF CHOICE, AND MADE ABORTION LEGAL IN THE UNITED STATES</h3>
</div>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Limited abortion became legal in America, via a Supreme Court case called&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade" target="_blank">Roe Vs Wade</a>. Before that point, women used clothes hangers and dangerous non medical providers of abortion services. As a result of these unsafe non medical practices, thousands of women died in their botched attempts at abortion.</p>
<p>What was life like for single pregnant women or girls before abortion and birth control/contraception were options in the United States?</p></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">WHAT WAS LIFE LIKE FOR A PREGNANT SINGLE WOMAN IN THE 1800&#8217;S, WHEN ABORTION WAS IMMORAL, ILLEGAL AND WOMEN HAD ZERO RIGHTS?</h3>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><b>In the 1800s, unmarried pregnant girls like Maria were in deep trouble. Religious ideas about sin held that a woman&#8217;s &#8220;virtue&#8221; was ruined if she had sex outside of marriage. Thus disgraced, a woman had few options if her &#8220;seducer&#8221; refused to marry her. Often she was banished, forced to live apart from family and community. This was an era when birth control was not widely available or reliable. Women could not vote, own property, or control their own money. (They could also be committed to an insane asylum on the say-so of a man[1]). Countless &#8216;fallen&#8217; women—who&#8217;d been raped, or jilted by their lovers—had to resort to prostitution to make ends meet. Prostitutes lived an average of about four years, falling victim to violence and venereal disease. As for surrendering a child for adoption, in the mid-1800s, there were 30,000 homeless children[2] living on New York streets, and no reliable foster care or orphan asylums. Maria Bodine was in dire straits.&nbsp;</b></div>

Women had no rights, and were often just objects to be used and thrown away at will.</p>
<p>Is this what Trump means when he says he wants to make America great again, like back in this &#8216;good ol days&#8217; when women could be used like objects, and they had no rights, with no ability to go to court or own land, or vote?</p>
<p>Women are coming into their own, and establishing their feminine power. Some women think that operating like a man and doing it via corruption, stealing, fraud and top down 1 percent control is the way, but they are deluded and mistaken.</p>
<p>The power of women warriors is in facilitation, community, bottoms up rule, and true democracy, not top down, corporate controlled 1 percent pulling the strings behind the scenes, while children, women and the elderly are left homeless, suffering and are punished if they try to survive.&nbsp;</p></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">IF ABORTION AND/OR BIRTH CONTROL IS MADE ILLEGAL, THERE WILL BE MANY MORE GERALDINE SANTORO&#8217;S</h3>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Geraldine &#8220;Gerri&#8221; Santoro (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Married_and_maiden_names">née</a> Twerdy) (August 16, 1935 – June 8, 1964) was an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">American</a>&nbsp;woman who died because of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsafe_abortion">illegal abortion</a> in 1964. A photograph of her after death, published in 1973, became a symbol of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro-choice">pro-choice movement</a>.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerri_Santoro">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerri_Santoro</a></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Of course, anyone associated with illegal abortion is arrested and thrown into jail, so that would also be part of the price of making abortion and birth control; lots and lots of people being punished, having criminal records and not being able to work or find a job after that, due to discrimination. America already has more people in jail per capita, than any other civilized nation on Earth, by large margins, and prisons are suffering from overcrowding. This situation will only get worse with more moral punishments and laws.&nbsp;</div>

<a href="http://jme.bmj.com/search?author1=Barbara+Hewson&amp;sortspec=date&amp;submit=Submit">Barbara Hewson</a></p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Of course, many women will not accept the suffering which continuing with pregnancy would cause them (or their families), and take steps accordingly. <b>In countries where safe abortion is illegal or unavailable, this results in self-imposed or “back-street” abortions and all the ills that flow from that: injury, infection, infertility, and even death. It is striking that complications from unsafe abortion are estimated to result in 13 per cent of maternal deaths worldwide.<a href="http://jme.bmj.com/content/27/suppl_2/ii10.full#ref-3">3</a> It is hard to see how such wastage of female life could be condoned in ethical terms.</b> As Ann Furedi has said: “The issue is not so much whether or when the embryo/fetus is deserving of respect per se, but how much respect and value we accord to a life (that does not even know it is alive) relative to the respect and value we have for the life of the woman who carries it.”<a href="http://jme.bmj.com/content/27/suppl_2/ii10.full#ref-4">4</a></div>

<div style="text-align: justify;"><b style="background-color: yellow;">Rick Santorum: Contraception &#8216;A Grievous Moral Wrong&#8217;</b></div>
<div><b style="background-color: yellow;">VIDEO:</b>&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/MBl634yYxas" style="text-align: justify;">https://youtu.be/MBl634yYxas</a>&nbsp;3 min.</p>
</div>
<div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">99% of women, including Catholics, have used artificial birth control. This means that in the literalist world, they are all guilty of a grievous moral wrong.. What is Santorum pointing at? What does he really mean? &nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">The literalist world, any killing of an egg or sperm with birth control is murder, pure and simple. In other words, any man using a condom, and any woman using any form of birth control is a murderer. Let&#8217;s take that a step further and see if this makes any logical sense at all.</p>
<p>According to Bible literalists and dominionists, if you use birth control in the form of a condom or a birth control pill, you are guilty of murder and must be executed. Of course, this sounds shocking and ridiculous, but this is what many literalists and dominists believe and want to put into law.</p>
<p>How many other death penalties are there in the Bible that the literalists or dominionists believe in?&nbsp;</p></div>

<h3>WHY DO PEOPLE CHOOSE ABORTION?&nbsp;</h3>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Abortion is never an easy choice to make. But trying to make it illegal and ban it by law would be the same as making alcohol illegal. People would still do it, only now they are criminals. If a 10 year old girl or an 18 year old woman is raped, that 10 year old child, that girl, teen or even an adult woman should have the right to have an abortion.</p>
<p>Extremist literalists believe that even in case of incest or rape, if a girl, teen or woman becomes pregnant, they should be FORCED to have that baby and to be happy about it, seeing that child as a &#8216;gift&#8217;. Why do poor women seek out abortion services, and what happens, now that federal law no longer allows federal funds to be used for this purpose? Insurance no longer covers abortion either thanks to Republicans passing that law..</p>

<h3>RAPED 10 YEAR OLD GIRL DENIED ABORTION IN PARAGUAY</h3>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">In a country like Paraguay, where abortions are allowed only if the life of the mother is in danger, a 10 year old girl is being forced to have the baby of her stepfather. This situation is rather common in countries like this, and results in a huge homeless children population, as girls like this and their offspring are abandoned or thrown out on the street.&nbsp;</div>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">EVERY YEAR, 300,000 AMERICANS ARE VICTIMS OF RAPE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT; LARGE % ARE AGED YOUNGER THAN 18</h3>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Contains graphic information that may be upsetting.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Every year, 300,000 Americans are the victims of rape and sexual assault. Last year, three of them were my classmates. My name is Danielle, and I&#8217;m a 16-year-old student in Oklahoma. Last fall my high school got famous after three girls were sexually assaulted by the same popular classmate, and then bullied out of school by our peers when they reported the crimes. I was shocked, not just that my friends and classmates participated in the bullying, but that the school administration did nothing to stop it.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>

So far, we&#8217;ve successfully worked to ensure that the rapist was held accountable for his crimes, and lobbied our state government to pass a law requiring sexual assault prevention classes for all students and faculty in the state. But we can’t stop there.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.change.org/p/protect-our-kids-pass-the-teach-safe-relationships-act?" target="_blank">I started a petition asking Congress to pass the Teach Safe Relationships Act, which will require schools around the country to implement the same curriculum. Will you sign it?</a></p>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">In the U.S., girls my age are four times more likely than the general population to be victims of rape, attempted rape, or sexual assault, which is why educating kids about healthy relationships and the importance of consent is so crucial. The Teach Safe Relationships Act would teach kids my age how to spot abusive behavior, promote understanding of consent and sexual assault, and make sure we know where to turn for help if we need it.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">I wonder how things would have been different at my school if we had these programs, and if the tragedy that happened here could have been avoided. What I do know is that future tragedies can be prevented around the country if Congress passes this bill.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Girls ages 16-19 are four times more likely than the general population to be victims of rape, attempted rape, or sexual assault. Educating teens about issues of consent and healthy relationships is essential to reversing these horrifying statistics.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">This bill has already been introduced in Congress, but without our united voices calling on our elected representatives to act, it will be easy for them to brush this issue under the rug. Together, we can make a difference.&nbsp;</div>

Abortion In Kenya: The Battle Rages</p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">There is a raging debate regarding abortion after statistics from <b>a study by the Ministry of Health and African Population and Health Research Center (APHRC) revealed that over 465,000 abortions were procured in Kenya in 2012 through clandestine and unsafe medical procedures.</b><b>&nbsp;</b>&#8230;.Secondly, the rapid rate of urbanization and the attendant erosion of the moral fabric of our traditional values have resulted in numerous social problems. The aping of foreign ideologies and the adoption of an economically superior but morally inferior western culture by our youth has resulted in many cases of teenage pregnancies. The inevitable consequence has been the birth of many unwanted children all over the country. <b>Research has linked the presence of many neglected and homeless children in our urban centers to these problems. Moralists who are opposed to the legalization of abortion should demonstrate responsibility by establishing institutions to cater for these neglected and homeless children.</b></div>

<div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">How is a priest innocent of pedophilia and a sexual crime if the child he violates is between 12 and 17 years old? These literalists have some really strange beliefs.. like rape is ok if the boy or girl is between 12 and 17, as long as the perp is a priest.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Somehow, despite all of this rather &#8216;unique&#8217; belief system, anti choice advocates are ready, willing and able to commit violence, including murder, to further the literalist belief system..&nbsp;</div>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Definition and characteristics</h3>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Anti-abortion violence is a form of terrorism specifically visited upon people who or places which provide abortion. Incidents include vandalism, arson, and bombings of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_clinic">abortion clinics</a>, such as those committed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Rudolph">Eric Rudolph</a>, and murders or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_murder">attempted murders</a> of physicians and clinic staff, as committed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Charles_Kopp">James Kopp</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Jennings_Hill">Paul Jennings Hill</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Roeder">Scott Roeder</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_F._Griffin">Michael F.

<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Some of those opposed to abortion have sometimes resorted to very public demonstrations of violence in an effort to achieve their objective of curbing abortions.

<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">David C. Nice, of the University of Georgia, describes support for anti-abortion violence as a political weapon against women&#8217;s rights, one that is associated with tolerance for violence toward women.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_violence#cite_note-5">[5]</a></div>

Rogers told investigators that he was motivated to commit the crime by his opposition to abortion, and that what more directly prompted the act was seeing a patient enter the clinic during one of the frequent anti-abortion protests there. The clinic had previously been bombed at Christmas in 1984 and was the site of the murder of Dr. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Britton_(doctor)">John Britton</a> and James Barrett in 1994.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_violence#cite_note-49">[49]</a></div>

Faulty construction of the bombs limited damage to a single external burnt area, though if successful damage would have been severe. It is believed that the individuals who made the attack were responsible for graffiti &#8220;baby killers&#8221; on the site, indicating an anti-abortion reason for the attack. The site turned out to in fact not be an abortion clinic, though the attackers most likely were not aware of this.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_violence#cite_note-australia2-55">[55]</a></div>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Canada</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">
Attempted murder</h3>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Violence has also occurred in Canada, where three doctors have been attacked to date. There is speculation that the timing of the shootings is related to the Canadian observance of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_Day">Remembrance Day</a>. The physicians were part of a pattern of attacks, which targeted providers in Canada and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstate_New_York">upstate New York</a>, including Dr. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnett_Slepian">Barnett Slepian</a>. All victims were shot, or shot at, in their homes with a rifle, at dusk or in the morning, in late October or early November.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">A joint Canadian-F.B.I. task force investigating the shootings was not formed until December 1997—three years after the first attack. A task force coordinator, Inspector David Bowen of the Hamilton-Wentworth Regional Police, complained that the Canadian Government was not adequately financing the investigation.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Inspector Bowen said the task force, largely financed by the communities where the shootings occurred, has &#8220;operated on a shoestring&#8221; with a budget of $100,000. He said he requested more funds in July that would raise its budget to $250,000. Federal officials rejected the request on Oct 15, a week before Dr. Slepian was killed. Inspector Bowen said that there hadn&#8217;t been funding to follow up potential leads.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_violence#cite_note-snipers-12">[12]</a></div>

<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Dr. Romalis saved his own life by using his bathrobe belt as a tourniquet. Dr. Romalis still performs abortions and has become more outspoken about abortion rights since he was shot, citing the harm done to women by illegal abortion and the thousands of cases of septic abortion that came to his hospital in residency.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_violence#cite_note-snipers-12">[12]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_violence#cite_note-romalis-56">[56]</a></div>

<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">The next day, clinic management announced that the firebombing failed to prevent any abortions, since all scheduled abortions were carried out in alternative locations. A portion of the Toronto Women&#8217;s Bookstore, next door, was damaged. No one was hurt but the building had to be demolished.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">On the day after the firebombing, Morgentaler came to inspect the damage and a crowd of abortion-rights supporters appeared at the clinic with signs that read, &#8220;Just Say No to Bombs.&#8221; As a result of the arson, the Ontario government decided to spend $420,000 on improved security for abortion clinics.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">At the time, all four free-standing clinics in Ontario were in Toronto. The government wanted to gather information about activities by anti-abortion sympathizers; at the time, law enforcement agencies in Canada did not collect statistics about harassment and violence against abortion providers, their clinics, or their clients.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_violence#cite_note-bomb-59">[59]</a></div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_of_God_(United_States)">Army of God</a>, an underground terrorist organization active in the United States, has been responsible for a substantial amount of anti-abortion violence. In addition to numerous property crimes, the group has committed acts of kidnapping, attempted murder, and murder. In August 1982, three men identifying as the Army of God kidnapped Hector Zevallos (a doctor and clinic owner) and his wife, Rosalee Jean, holding them for eight days.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_violence#cite_note-baird-20">[20]</a>&nbsp;</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">In the late 1990s, an organization called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Coalition_of_Life_Activists">American Coalition of Life Activists</a> (ACLA) was accused of implicitly advocating violence by its publication on its &#8220;Nuremberg Files&#8221; website of wanted-style posters, which featured a photograph of a physician who performed abortions along with a monetary reward for any information that would lead to his &#8220;arrest, conviction, and revocation of license to practice medicine&#8221;.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_violence#cite_note-65">[65]</a>&nbsp;</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">While still rejecting anti-abortion violence, a few anti-abortion leaders have tempered their condemnation of anti-abortion violence by suggesting that the harm created by crimes against property is small in comparison to the harm of abortion. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Scheidler">Joseph Scheidler</a>observed that &#8220;for the sake of proper perspective&#8221; he wanted to note that &#8220;no amount of damage to real estate can equal the violence of taking a single human life&#8221; through abortion.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_violence#cite_note-prolifeaction.org-74">[74]</a> The Rev.

<div style="text-align: justify;">Anti-abortion all-stars. Federal lawmakers made news last year when an all-male House committee <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/04/20-week-abortion-bill_n_3385122.html">convened</a> a hearing on abortion (<a href="http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/01/09/3140711/taxpayer-funding-abortion-hearing/">twice</a>). <b>Male legislators dominate in proposing anti-abortion bills in the states, too. Of the 330 state lawmakers to sponsor such measures last year, 257—more than 75 percent—were men.&nbsp;</b></div>

The losers in this war against women are all of the millions of children who are homeless, and all of the aged out foster kids, who have no support.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">If abortion is outlawed, many more children will be homeless and many more foster kids will end up without support, homeless and without hope.&nbsp;</div>
<p>http://bit.ly/2pBOgqp</p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Overall, the focus in a Capitalistic society such as the US is on using women and children, who are either being used as commodities or objectified things, or they are attacked in a war.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">This lose lose battle and Capitalistic focus needs to change from fear and attack, into acceptance and love, while providing what women ask for and need in order to raise a healthy, just, empathic next generation. Leaving millions of kids without the basics of life just condemns them to a life of despair, suffering and prison.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">No society can survive for long by condemning millions of it&#8217;s own citizens to a life of hopelessness and prison.</div>

<h3>WHAT YOU CAN DO: SUPPORT NARAL AND THE REPRODUCTIVE FACT ACT</h3>
</div>
<div style="text-align: start;">
<div>Subject: Tell Your Assemblymember to Support the Reproductive FACT Act&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Even though we have resources and protections for women in California, critical help for millions of women is going unused. California women can get help paying for abortion, contraception, and prenatal care, but most just don’t know that it’s out there. Worse still, many women thinking about abortion are being lied to by fake doctors who tell them that abortion causes breast cancer or infertility. This is barbaric, and it has to stop.Today, NARAL Pro-Choice California released findings from an undercover investigation that reveals that crisis pregnancy centers (CPCs) in California pose a danger to public health. The findings from the investigation can be found at <a href="http://www.cpclies.com/">www.cpclies.com</a>.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Our lawmakers are the only ones that can make this right, and we have to send them a message. That’s why NARAL Pro-Choice California and Black Women for Wellness are sponsoring a bill, the Reproductive FACT Act (AB 775), that would help ensure every woman has the access and the care we’ve fought for decades to protect.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Join me and tell your assemblymember to pass AB 775 and give every woman the help they need?</div>

<h3>VOTE</h3>
<p>
The Dualopoly largely supports the war on women and the homeless. They may give cheap lip service and promise things, but as soon as either a Democrat or Republican gets in, they switch their tune, to sing the praise of corporate power and control, while cutting all of the things that the 99 percent need in terms of a social safety net and infrastructure.</p>
<p>Many people are being misled, hoodwinked and misinformed about who and what to vote for. Vote, but make your vote count, instead of wasting it on evil or more evil, via a fear based motivation. Anyone voting for a Republican these days is voting to ban abortion and overturn Roe vs Wade.</p>

<p>Trump has made it very clear that is goal is to overturn Roe vs Wade by getting in very extremely Conservative judges who will engineer and support making all women into criminals who attempt to do an abortion, whether in a back alley or with a doctor. In his view, women need to be punished who elect for ANY reason to have an abortion, with no exceptions.&nbsp;</p></div>

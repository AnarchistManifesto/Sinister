<p><b><a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2013/03/eu-raids-private-savings-accounts-to.html" target="_blank">Activist Post</a></b></p>
<p>It was anticipated that the weekend could bring finalized plans for how Cyprus would be dealt with by the Troika and parliament. The central problem that had revealed itself in the wake of the original indefinite bank holiday and subsequent ATM drain and protests, was how to stop capital flight when banks reopen, as well as a more widespread bank run across the Eurozone as trust in the banking system verges on collapse.</p>
<p>The two largest banks in Cyprus saw the imposition of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2013/03/24/business/24reuters-eurozone-cyprus-withdrawals.html">ATM withdrawal limits</a>, which declined from 260 Euros to 100 Euros ahead of projected bank openings <strike>tomorrow, Tuesday</strike> — <b><strike>Sorry, make that Wednesday</strike></b>. <b><a href="http://www.cybc.com.cy/en/index.php/cyprus-news/item/2704-1">Sorry, again, make that Thursday</a></b>. An <a href="http://www.cybc.com.cy/en/index.php/cyprus-news/item/2699-1">urgent statement was originally issued by the Central Bank</a> prior to yet another delay that, “For the smooth functioning of the entire banking system, the Finance Minister has decided upon the recommendation of the Governor of the CBC, that all banks remain closed until Wednesday, 27 March 2013 included.” The ongoing closure makes this the longest in history. See other closures <b><a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-03-25/cyprus-delays-reopening-banks-again-here-are-longest-bank-closures-ever">here</a></b>.</p>
<p>One key indicator for just how orchestrated this has been, and how dangerous the outcome, is that a final deal was supposedly reached at a dinner with Mario Draghi, Christine Lagarde, Herman Van Rompuy, and José Manuel Barroso — essentially the Four Horsemen of economic apocalypse.</p>
<p>The new decision has been made to honor those who were insured up to 100,000 Euros (as if it is some sort of gift), but to steal <a href="http://www.cybc.com.cy/en/index.php/cyprus-news/item/2697-1">around 30%</a> of the money of depositors at the Bank of Cyprus, and <i>all of the money</i> for the uninsured of Cyprus Popular bank…</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>Even worse is the fact that a final deal was thought to hinge upon a vote by parliament, but as ZeroHedge notes:</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>
There is talk that there may be no need for the government to vote for this – since it is not a ‘tax’ but a bank restructuring. It seems they have kept it in the bankers … the ECB (in its independent way) tells the Cypriot NCB what it should do, the Cypriot central bank then restructures its bank how it sees fit – good/bad bank and haircuts where it sees fit – this then gets around need for vote from government AND any possibility of a European Union law (on taxation) being broken … (<a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-03-24/rampapalooza-cyprus-troika-reach-deal">Source</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The deal is being welcomed by Eurozone finance ministers, naturally. On the surface it might seem that only a group of heavy investors will take the hit and that the common man has been saved, but even German Finance Minister, Wolfgang Schaeuble, had to admit that, “Cyprus faces a long, difficult path to rebuild its economy, but claimed that the deal reached in Brussels offers the country the best chance of getting back on its feet.” (<a href="http://www.cybc.com.cy/en/index.php/international-news/item/2692-1">Source</a>)</p>

Other finance ministers weighed in on the program:</p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

IMF chief Christine Lagarde said the agreement was a comprehensive and credible plan which provided the basis for restoring trust in the Cypriot banking system, which was key to supporting growth. </p>

<p>
IMF chief Christine Lagarde said she would recommend to the board of the IMF that they should take part in the programme, but did not specify the amount. </p>

French Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici rejected charges that the EU had brought Cypriots to their knees, saying it was the island’s offshore business model that had failed. </p>

He repeated his favourite catch phrase that Cyprus had a cazino (sic) economy that was on the brink of bankruptcy. (<a href="http://www.cybc.com.cy/en/index.php/international-news/item/2693-1">Source</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>German Chancellor <a href="http://www.cybc.com.cy/en/index.php/international-news/item/2698-1">Angela Merkel was thrilled as well</a> that “the deal was right for Cyprus because it ensured that those who contributed to the crisis were required to pay towards its resolution.”</p>
<p>These words should be anything but comforting coming from a system of centralized control. The IMF in particular has been responsible for freeing exactly <i>zero </i>countries from any type of economic turmoil, but <i>are </i>specialists at introducing and exacerbating systems of long-term economic enslavement . . . see <b><a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2013/02/argentina-in-shadow-of-imf.html">Argentina</a> </b>and <b><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoIJPwfsbqg">Jamaica</a></b>. The <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/?p=18744">IMF (a.k.a financial terrorists)</a> absolutely loves crisis and is always positioned to capitalize through <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2012/01/state-emergency-managers-usher-in-imf.html">austerity and Soviet-style governance</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Cyprus, bank employees and the general public alike <a href="http://www.cybc.com.cy/en/index.php/cyprus-news/item/2696-1">wait for banks to reopen</a> in order to assess the damage. Apparently <a href="http://www.cybc.com.cy/en/index.php/cyprus-news/item/2703-1"><b>no one knows how much money</b></a> might already have fled Cypriot banks, since branches in London and Russia did not close or impose financial restrictions.</p>

<p><i><b>Previous Update from 3-24</b>:</i></p>
<p>The Cyprus parliament and the Troika agreed today on a deal to steal billions to bailout the insolvent banks in Cyprus to prevent a feared bankruptcy, and details of yesterday’s 9 bills on capital controls also started to emerge. Both are even worse for financial freedom than previously thought.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of the populist outrage against the initial plan to raid everyone’s bank accounts to pay for private bank failures, the autocrats decided they would raid up to 20% from wealthy depositors with over €100,000 at the Bank of Cyprus and 4% at other banks. Simultaneously, the plan would nationalize pensions of average citizens which are, for the moment, safe from the heist.</p>
<p>Russia Today <a href="http://rt.com/news/cyprus-bailout-tax-troika-730/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reports</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>
Cyprus and the Troika have agreed to a 20 per cent tax on deposits over 100,000 euros at the Bank of Cyprus and 4 per cent on deposits held at other banks.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>
A senior Cypriot official told Reuters that a plan to tap nationalized pension funds would not be a part of a plan to raise billions of euros in return for a bailout from the European Union. Cyprus said earlier on Saturday that it was looking at seizing a quarter of the value of big deposits at its largest bank in order to raise such funds.</p>

<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>
“Unfortunately, the events of recent days have led to a situation where there are no longer any optimal solutions available. Today, there are only hard choices left,” European Union Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn said in a statement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All this because the Bank of Cyprus’ capital was supposedly wiped out by their forced investments of Greek debt during their bailout phase.  How are everyday citizens and foreign depositors to blame for this scenario? How can they call it a tax when the money goes directly to banks instead of helping the nation?</p>
<p>It seems the Troika is waging a successful class warfare propaganda battle against the Cypriot people and parliament. They have made robbing people’s private bank accounts acceptable as long as it only happens to the wealthy.</p>
<p>“If it was like this, I think it might be quite suitable because it means that the highest deposits will be taxed,” <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/23/us-cyprus-parliament-idUSBRE92G03I20130323" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">said</a> Finnish Prime Minister Jyrki Katainen.</p>
<p>But do average citizens and small depositors make out better in this deal? The Troika and the Cyprus parliament are no longer demanding a “fee” from average depositors, they’ll now take their financial freedom instead by implementing harsh capital controls to keep depositors from moving their money freely, and they took control of pensions.</p>

<p><i><b>Previous Update from 3-22</b>:</i><br />
The question has now been answered about how to do that even after a complete loss of trust from depositors who had been assured from president Anastasiades just weeks before that no such scheme would take place: Government force, naturally.</p>
<p>Parliament passed a package of 9 bills, including a restructure of the country’s second largest bank, plus <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/mar/21/eurozone-crisis-cyprus-bailout-plan-b">limitations on cash transactions</a>. While specific details are still yet to be released, capital controls are the final stage of looting implemented by the government-banking-oligarchy. It is yet another benchmark set in the forward march toward a complete banking takeover.</p>
<p>This weekend is expected to reveal much more about how the Eurozone is going to manage Cyprus, and set a precedent for handling other nations. (<a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-03-22/cyprus-officially-passes-capital-controls-law">Source</a>)</p>

<b>Update 3/22</b>: Local news in Cyprus is reporting an escalation in the protests that have begun in the wake of attempts by EU chiefs to confiscate the savings of depositors. The news of possible bank closures has enraged the public. It appears that in order to keep things under control, the Central Bank is discussing a possible bank merger rather than a full shut down.</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>
The Central Bank of Cyprus today intervened to quash frantic reports that Cyprus Popular Bank is to be closed down. </p>

<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>
The reports sent hundreds of Cyprus Popular Bank employees and holders of the bank’s bonds out into the streets. Police deployed a strong force outside the Bank’s headquarters in the capital Nicosia to prevent them smashing into the building.

<p>Here is a video showing police in riot gear on the scene:</p>
</p>
<p>Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation says the following:</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>
The European Central Bank today said it had decided to allow the Central Bank of Cyprus to keep providing banks with emergency funding until this coming Monday. </p>

<p>Recent photos of the protests were posted at <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/">ZeroHedge</a>, which you can see <b><a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-03-21/cyp-riots-begin">HERE</a>.</b> One protester can be seen holding a sign that says, “Where is the solidarity?”</p>

<p>ATMs in Cyprus have been all but drained, electronic transfers were halted, and riots ensued following a decision by European Union chiefs to raid private savings accounts to help pay for the country’s $13 billion bailout. It was believed that there were plans to stretch a bank holiday to at least one week, while the exact measures were decided upon. However, yesterday the Cypriot parliament rejected the scheme outright, leading many to speculate that this would be the start of something even worse.</p>
<p>Sure enough, much like the U.S. Federal Reserve threatened martial law and blood in the streets if Congress didn’t accept sweeping bailouts in 2008, now Germany is saying that Cypriot banks might never reopen after parliament’s decision:</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>
Germany’s finance minister, Wolfgang Schaeuble said major Cypriot banks were “insolvent if there are no emergency funds,” <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-21854353">according to a BBC report</a>, meaning savers might lose all their money if no deal was reached.

</blockquote>
<p>There is extreme worry that if the banks do reopen, capital flight is all but assured. Meanwhile, similar confiscation schemes are being proposed for <b>Italy and New Zealand (more on that below)</b>, spurring questions about which other nations are in line for a “haircut” . . . perhaps better called “the chopping block.”</p>
<p>Whether or not Cyprus gets its bailout in one form or another — perhaps from Russia — this is a precedent-setting crisis that is already leading to such a level of distrust in Cyprus that merchants are even <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-03-20/cyprus-atms-low-cash-credit-card-payments-refused-medvedev-compares-europe-ussr">refusing credit card payments</a>.

<div>
Cyprus president Nicos Anastasiades agreed to the deal, which completely reversed his previous assurances that it would not happen. It sets a very dangerous precedent for future bailouts. As if brutal austerity wasn’t enough, the EU is now demanding a bailout tax making citizens and expat depositors alike personally liable for government and private bank debts. Reuters also noted that according to a draft of the legislation, criminal penalties of up to 3 years in jail and 50,000 euros could be imposed upon anyone who doesn’t comply.</p>

<p>Cyprus is now the fifth country seeking a bailout, but the extraordinarily high depositor tax is unprecedented. Eurozone citizens and outside investors might not see the tax as the confidence-inspiring measure that government asserts it to be. Rather, citizens everywhere will view it as a clear signal that other governments are ready to follow suit and are extremely <i>unclear </i>about who will ultimately be affected, thus <i>destroying </i>confidence in the entire banking system. The “Russian billionaire” angle might be used to forestall more widespread outrage, but it is still new ground to go directly after depositors … and not all affected depositors will be Russian billionaires, especially at a starting point of 20,000 euros.</p>
<p>“This is theft, pure and simple,” one pensioner told Reuters. Yes it is.</p>
</p>
<p>And here’s some colorful commentary about this:</p>
</p>
<p>A final vote from Cyprus’ parliament has been postponed several times, and now appears to be set for <b>9 AM Wednesday</b>. Arm twisting by banksters continues to work toward the necessary 33% approval to solidify wealth confiscation. The latest poll shows that <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-03-17/71-cypriots-say-parliament-should-reject-bailout">71% of Cypriots</a> want to reject the scheme.</p>

<p>And for those who believe that something like this could not happen throughout Europe, or even in the United States, Tyler Durden of ZeroHedge posits that the Rubicon has been crossed and “wealth taxation” is a topic that is likely to grow in popularity among banking oligarchs. Although in the U.S. wealth taxation might take a slightly different form than what is being proposed for Cyprus.</p>

So, if the US was to go the Cyprus route, and begin impairing balance sheet liabilities to remark assets, there would be precious little space (with just $4.3 trillion in total other funding liabilities), before one would need to start eating into the deposit base, should Congress decide to implement a very “fair and just” financial asset tax in the US next. </p>

<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>
Will Congress do this? Obviously, nobody can answer that question now. However, it was “absolutely certain” as recently as 48 hours ago that Cyprus too would see no depositor “bail in” either. Then things changed rapidly.

Which means that if, indeed, the US proceeds with its own wealth tax, then deposits may well be one “wealth class” that gets impaired. Of course, since in the US other financial assets, namely the stock market, account for a far greater proportion of household net worth, it is quite possible that instead of impairing deposits at US banks, which already subsist solely due to the Fed’s $2 trillion in excess reserves, the government may instead choose to generously tax simply 30% of all of your stock holdings, and achieve the same “wealth transfer” result.

<p>In fact, this type of asset taxation is already being proposed for Italy, as stated by Commerzbank’s chief economist, Jörg Krämer :</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>
“A tax rate of 15% on financial assets would probably be enough to push the Italian government debt to below the critical level of 100% of gross domestic product.” So there you have it, the ‘new deal’ in Europe, as we warned, is ‘wealth taxes’ and testing the “capacity of Cypriots” appears to be the strawman on what the public will take before social unrest becomes intolerable.

<p><b>New Zealand is also considering a Cyprus-like solution for their bank failures</b>. </p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>
“Bill English is proposing a Cyprus-style solution for managing bank failure here in New Zealand – a solution that will see small depositors lose some of their savings to fund big bank bailouts,” said Green Party Co-leader Dr Russel Norman. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>
The Reserve Bank is in the final stages of implementing a system of managing bank failure called Open Bank Resolution. The scheme will put all bank depositors on the hook for bailing out their bank. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>
Depositors will overnight have their savings shaved by the amount needed to keep the bank afloat. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>
While the details are still to be finalised, nearly all depositors will see their savings reduced by the same proportions. (<a href="http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA1303/S00306/national-planning-cyprus-style-solution-for-new-zealand.htm">Source</a>)</p>

<p>One thing is for certain, banksters and their government partners are in no position to earn anyone’s trust.</p>

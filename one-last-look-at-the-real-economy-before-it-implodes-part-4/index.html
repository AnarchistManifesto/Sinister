<a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2015/04/one-last-look-at-real-economy-before-it.html"><b>Activist Post</b></a></p>
<p>In the first three installments of this series, we examined the   realities behind supply and demand, unemployment and personal debt, and   national debt. As has been proven in each consecutive article with  ample  evidence, mainstream establishment numbers are, for the most  part,  utter garbage. They are not legitimate. They are meaningless.</p>
<p>The  figures and stats that do have some truth to them are so  obscured from  the public view and unreported by the media that they may  as well be  state secrets. The average person has no clue of their  existence because  his primary sources of information are  establishment-dominated. Even  MSM talking heads and economic “analysts”  are so mesmerized by the false  version of the economic world that they  have no point of reference when  suddenly confronted with singular  facts. Some people call this  catastrophic behavior a “positive feedback  loop.” It is a mainstream  echo chamber that has become a financial  tomb.</p>
<p>Now that I have  covered the lies within our economy that I can prove  absolutely, it is  time to move on to the lies that are more difficult  to pin down. These  lies often slip past our investigations because the  hard data that could be  used to expose them is simply not available to  the general public. In  fact, much of the data is not even available to  government officials. I  am, of course, talking about the hard data  behind the activities of  central banks across the globe — the  International Monetary Fund, the  Bank for International Settlements and  the Federal Reserve in  particular. In this installment, we will  explore the purpose of these lies; to hide the imminent  destruction of  our currency — by hook, by crook and by fiat.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>In <a href="http://www.alt-market.com/articles/2539-one-last-look-at-the-real-economy-before-it-implodes-part-3">Part 3 of this series</a>,  real U.S. liabilities were  revealed to far exceed official stats given  by the Treasury Department  (upward of $200 trillion currently owed,  not owed in some distant future  where none of us will be alive to worry  about it). The debt singularity  most responsible for this problem has  been created through entitlement  programs, as well as a Social Security  program that the government uses  as its own ever-cycling taxpayer  supported personal slush fund, triggering a debt accumulation of more   than $8 trillion per year.</p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>How does our government (or any  government with a central bank)  continue to function monetarily if it is  generating far more debt than  it will ever be able to pay off in tax  revenues? Well, our system does  not really “function.” It just refuses to fully  die. And, it does this  through fiat money creation.</p>
<p>The  quantitative easing programs, which allowed the Federal Reserve  to  conjure massive stores of fiat money out of thin air and purchase  U.S.  Treasury bonds (among other things), were a blatantly open  admission by  bureaucrats and central bankers alike that the government  has not been  capable of sustaining its own operations without fiat aid.</p>
<p>I’ll say it again: QE programs are in and of themselves hard evidence  of government insolvency.  Solvent governments do not need to monetize  their own debt obligations with a printing press.<br />
After the limited TARP audit, which reveled a money creation scheme  in excess of $16 trillion (overnight swaps are still a devaluing action  though some MSM pundits argue they are not “debt creation”), there has  been little information available to the public in regards to the true  level of paper and digital money conjured from the ether.  We have no  idea to what extent the dollar has ultimately been devalued, and we  won’t know until foreign investors and banks finalize their decoupling  from the U.S. (a process that will likely accelerate this year).</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/familysurvival.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-DWeuuOEUtms/UCFiCYR0z0I/AAAAAAAARN4/FDTY8AB2U8o/s200/14.gif"></a>One  might argue, though, that since the finalization of the taper  and the  end of QE3 and the bailout programs overall, our system must be  amply  flush with cash yet again and the printing bonanza must have  been worth the risk. Why else would the taper have been  instituted at  all? I would argue and have argued in the past that the taper was   instituted not in preparation for economic recovery, but in preparation   for economic collapse. The QE bailouts have stopped because they no  longer  serve any purpose in propping up the false economy.</p>
<p>For instance, the inspector general for the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) is now suggesting yet <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/william-m-isaac-fannie-and-freddie-may-need-more-bailouts-1427842261" target="_blank">another bailout</a>  for socialist New Deal failures Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, after the   Obama administration reserved the right to take all profits from the   conservatorship beginning in 2012. That’s right, all that money that  Fannie and  Freddie supposedly made and paid back didn’t make an ounce  of  difference, as the federal government now steals profits in order to  pay  off other debts. In the meantime, companies like Blackstone reap  the  benefits as they purchase and bid on hundreds of thousands of homes  for  pennies on the dollar, turn them into rentals and artificially  support  the illusion of a housing recovery in the United States. (I  would also  note that Blackstone has conveniently served as an “adviser”  to the U.S.  Treasury throughout the Fannie/Freddie bailouts.)</p>
<p>As referenced  in <a href="http://www.alt-market.com/articles/2528-one-last-look-at-the-real-economy-before-it-implodes-part-1">Part 1 of this series</a>,  stimulus  measures have absolutely failed to inspire any semblance of  recovery in  consumer demand, and global demand for goods is imploding.</p>
<p>As referenced in <a href="http://www.alt-market.com/articles/2534-one-last-look-at-the-real-economy-before-it-implodes-part-2">Part 2</a>, real employment has <i>not</i>  improved throughout the duration of the Troubled Asset Relief Program,   quantitative easing and zero interest-rate policy. In fact, it only   seems to have stalled unemployment at about 23 percent.</p>
<p>As  referenced in <a href="http://www.alt-market.com/articles/2539-one-last-look-at-the-real-economy-before-it-implodes-part-3">Part 3</a>,  stimulus actions  have only served to create even more unmitigated debt  while producing no  tangible results other than a massive bubble in  stock markets.</p>
<p>Poverty  is at record levels. Welfare demand is at record levels.  Average wages  are falling, and prices on essential goods (except oil at  this time) are  rising. Global demand is visibly sliding into the same  territory as in  2008/2009. Housing markets have become a corporately  boosted feudalistic  farce. And unemployment continues at a depressing  level; meanwhile,  people aren’t even counted as unemployed anymore  because they’ve been  jobless for so long.</p>
<p>At this point, at the onset of spring 2015, I  think it is safe to  say that alternative economic analysts have been  right all along in our  assertions that central bank stimulus measures  are completely useless. Though some of the slimier day traders like to  argue that they  “tripled their profits” during the stimulus period and  our “doom and  gloom” means nothing to them, in their naivety they would  be missing  the bigger picture. You don’t play the collapse. In the end,  the  collapse will play you.</p>
<p>Now, it would seem as though the  Federal Reserve has failed in every  aspect of its bailout quest. But  what are the consequences of this  debacle?  The result is the displacement of U.S.  economic standing. The  U.S. is being made economically irrelevant.</p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>China  has surpassed the U.S. as the world’s largest  exporter/importer and has  long been far superior to the U.S. in  manufacturing capability, making  China the most valuable economic  partner in the world. According to the  IMF, China is now superior to  the U.S. in trade standing and is soon to be the <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/world/2014/12/06/china-surpasses-us-to-become-largest-world-economy/" target="_blank">largest economy</a> on the planet.</p>
<p>China  has recently launched its regional Asian Development Bank, a  kind of Asian  World Bank. And nearly 50 countries, including European  allies  to the U.S., have rushed to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/03/world/asia/china-asian-infrastructure-investment-bank.html?_r=0" target="_blank">sign on</a>.</p>
<p>The  talk is even growing within mainstream circles that China is  about to  decouple from the U.S. economy and, along with the BRICS  nations,  structure a new Asian-centric financial system that will  “stick it” to  the Western financial elites. This, however, is too  simplistic a notion.</p>
<p>We are talking about the REAL<i> </i>economy in this series; and in  the real economy, no nation with a  central bank actually “breaks” from  the New World Order. In fact, all  conflicts between the East and West  are only serving to further the  cause of globalists and Fabian  socialists.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/backyardliberty.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: left;float: left;margin-bottom: 0em;margin-right: 1em"><img alt="" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-k0NQ-rOJPq0/UPDSF5crnFI/AAAAAAAATcw/i7Q6pBk-hoQ/s200/BL_013-200.gif"></a>China alone does not  have the capacity to replace the U.S. as a  primary driver for the global  economy, nor does the Yuan have the  capacity to replace the dollar as a world  reserve currency. However,  this is not China’s goal. It never has been China’s  goal. China’s only  purpose in its historic fiscal expansion has been to  achieve inclusion  in what the IMF calls the “global economic reset.”  Part of this reset  is the introduction of the IMF global currency basket  system, or  Special Drawing Rights (SDR), as a kind of centralized  control  mechanism for all currencies around the world. The IMF and China  have  continuously called for the <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2011/02/10/markets/dollar/" target="_blank">SDR basket system</a> to replace the U.S. dollar as the world reserve currency.</p>
<p>I covered this developing scheme in great detail in my article <a href="http://www.alt-market.com/articles/2403-the-economic-end-game-explained">‘The Economic End Game Explained’</a>.</p>
<p>Despite  the hopes of some alternative writers that China will  somehow break the  chains of the central banking monopoly, every Chinese  action since at  least 2008 has been in preparation to become a full  slave nation under  the control of IMF policy. China has now <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/24/china-imf-idUSL3N0WQ18120150324">officially submitted its  currency</a> (the Yuan) for inclusion as a reserve currency in the SDR  basket.  China’s central bank has <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Business/story?id=7168919">openly called for the IMF</a> to take a dominant role in the management of the world’s currencies through the SDR basket system:</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>
<i><b>The world economic crisis shows the “inherent   vulnerabilities and  systemic risks in the existing international   monetary system,” Gov. Zhou  Xiaochuan said in an essay released Monday   by the bank. He recommended  creating a currency made up of a basket of   global currencies and  controlled by the International Monetary Fund  and  said it would help “to  achieve the objective of safeguarding  global  economic and financial  stability.”</b></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><i><b></b></i> The IMF conference on the SDR, which takes place every  five years,  is set to begin preliminaries in May and finish in October  or November.  It is widely expected that China’s currency will indeed be  included in  the SDR this year, that this will adversely affect the dollar’s  standing as the world reserve currency, and that the U.S. will have  little  capacity to stop such a development. That’s because American  veto power  within the IMF is likely to be removed, due to a lack of  approval on  funding measures and policy changes put to Congress in  2010.</p>
<p>In numerous articles over the past couple of years I have warned that  the destruction of U.S. position within the IMF would be blamed on  “political gridlock” over the refusal by Congress to confirm policy  changes from 2010, and the brunt of the blame would be placed on  “conservatives”.  This past week my suspicions were supported by the  statements of Larry Summers, a former Treasury Secretary and elitist who  was partially responsible for the end of Glass-Steagall and the  creation of the derivatives bubble, and the man who claimed <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-11-22/larry-summers-history-will-overwhelmingly-approve-qe">“history will overwhelmingly approve QE”</a>.  Summers decried <a href="http://fortune.com/2015/04/06/larry-summers-u-s-has-lost-lost-its-role-as-underwriter-of-the-global-economic-system/">the end of the U.S.</a> as the “underwriter of the global economic system”,  also stating:</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>
<i><b>Largely because of resistance from the right, the US  stands alone in the  world in failing to approve the International  Monetary Fund governance  reforms that Washington itself pushed for in  2009. By supplementing IMF  resources, this change would have bolstered  confidence in the global  economy. More important, it would come closer  to giving countries such  as China and India a share of IMF votes  commensurate with their new  economic heft…</b></i><i><b></b></i> </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>
<i><b>With China’s economic size rivaling America’s and  emerging  markets accounting for at least half of world output, the  global  economic architecture needs substantial adjustment. Political  pressures  from all sides in the US have rendered it increasingly  dysfunctional…</b></i> </p>

<p>This  would make the Yuan the first currency not fully convertible to  join  the SDR basket. Meaning, it is difficult to directly invest in  Yuan  compared to investing in dollars. But this is exactly what the IMF   wants.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://atimes.com/2015/03/move-over-dollar-yuan-may-join-imfs-currency-basket/" target="_blank">Asian Times</a> put it rather bluntly but honestly:</p>

<p>
<i><b>Currently,  central banks can’t include yuan holdings in  their foreign exchange  reserves. However, via inclusion in the SDR  basket, the currency will  effectively enjoy a “back door” where  convertibility is concerned. The  upshot, according to Citibank, means  increased yuan demand from central  banks and further integration of the  currency into global capital market  flows.</b></i><i><b></b></i> </p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>
<i><b>Importantly, China has espoused an “internationalisation”   of reserve currencies away from U.S. dollar hegemony and dependencies  on  local economic fluctuations on exchange rates and stability. The  yuan  inclusion in the basket would be a step towards a more  multi-lateral  currency world. While full convertibility may still be  far away, China’s  ability to have a global reserve currency may soon be  upon us.</b></i> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes,  that’s right, China’s inclusion in the  SDR will HELP the  process of marginalization of the dollar and aid in the ascendance of  the SDR as a world reserve mechanism. And as China becomes a currency  powerhouse  in its role as the No. 1 economy in the world, the only way  central  banks around the planet can benefit or “invest” in the Yuan  will be by  stockpiling SDRs! Demand for SDRs will be cleverly boosted  by natural demand for the Yuan. This is how a global currency structure  begins.</p>
<p>The only true beneficiaries of this cycle will be the IMF and those  elites who desperately want a  totally centralized global economic  system.</p>
<p>In the meantime, as the dollar loses its world reserve status, it  loses the ONLY pillar of support keeping its value somewhat stable. As  the dollar  falls, U.S. citizens will be reduced to Second World or  Third World  economic expectations. Employment and wages will continue  to dissolve,  while the margins between the “haves” and “have nots” will  continue to  grow. In the worst-case scenario, total chaos would result  followed by an  international intervention to “save us” from ourselves.  Our currency  would likely be permanently pegged to the SDR basket,  just as  Argentina’s was pegged to our dollar after its collapse. And  the IMF  would own the U.S. rather than the U.S. owning the IMF, as is  the common  delusion.</p>
<p>As stated earlier, Federal Reserve stimulus actions  “seem” to have  failed miserably. Now our nation is facing a firestorm.  But I would  submit that the Federal Reserve has not failed in its mission. The Fed’s  purpose  is not to defend the stability of the U.S. economy and the  dollar; the  Fed’s purpose is to destroy the stability of the U.S.  economy and the  dollar. Thus, the Fed has succeeded in its mission. And  I believe a full  audit of Fed policies and actions would prove this  fact beyond a doubt.</p>
<p>I  will continue to outline the endgame for globalization that is  under  way in the next installment of this series, including how central  banks  in foreign nations collude with each other and are managed by   supranational entities like the IMF and the BIS. The implosion of   America serves a very particular purpose. It is not a product of blind   coincidence, fate, political stupidity or corporate greed. It is an   engineered event meant to clear the way for an even more sinister   economic environment designed to establish a final economic empire with  the purpose of permanently enslaving us all.</p>

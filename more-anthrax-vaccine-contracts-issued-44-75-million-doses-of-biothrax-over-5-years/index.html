<div style="font-family: inherit">
</div>
<div style="font-family: inherit"> On September 22, 2011, I wrote an article entitled, <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2011/09/grants-issued-for-next-generation.html">Grants Issued For Next-Generation Anthrax Vaccine; False Flag to Come, Or More Wasted Money?</a> in which I discussed the recent announcement that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) was granting the Biomedical Advanced Research and Developmental Authority (BARDA) millions of dollars for the purpose of creating a “next-generation anthrax vaccine and a new type of antitoxin.” </div>
<div style="font-family: inherit">
In this announcement, it was reported that BARDA would be contracting out the work in regards to these projects to two companies, Vaxin Inc. out of Rockville, Maryland and Elusys Therapeutics out of Pine Brook, New Jersey. </div>
<div style="font-family: inherit">
I also discussed the concerns related to Anthrax vaccine/antitoxin production in relation to the potential signaling of a false flag attack. This perspective is related to the fact that the original and much-touted <a href="http://www.infowars.com/report-vindicates-unanswered-questions-in-anthrax-conspiracy/">anthrax attacks of 2001</a> were not the result of fundamentalist Muslim terrorism but the direct result of US government involvement. </div>

<p>
It is important to understand, as addressed in the aforementioned article, the context in which the new vaccine production is being implemented. An example would be Barack Obama’s now famous <a href="http://nodis3.gsfc.nasa.gov/displayEO.cfm?id=EO_13527_" style="color: red">Executive Order (EO) 13527</a> which directly relates to a “bioterrorist” attack and contains language that has led many to speculate as to whether it also relates to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sTfpj-IF_Y" style="color: red">forced vaccination programs</a>. Not only that, but it is also important to understand the role government has played in creating and exploiting just these types of situations. </p>
<div style="font-family: inherit">
One should also be seriously concerned about the obvious adverse health effects created by the previously administered anthrax vaccines, particularly in <a href="http://www.infowars.com/articles/science/vaccines_anthrax_vaccine_makes_1200_sick.htm" style="color: red">American servicemen</a>, and how they relate to the new vaccines being produced. </div>
<div style="font-family: inherit">
I highly recommend that the reader go back to my <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2011/09/grants-issued-for-next-generation.html" style="color: red">previous article</a>  and read the information presented there for some brief background related to the concern of a potential false flag attack in regards to the recent announcement of contracts to produce new anthrax vaccines. </div>
<div style="font-family: inherit">
In light of these announcements, it was reported by <a href="https://gsnmagazine.com/node/24666?c=disaster_preparedness_emergency_response">Government Security News</a> that on October 3, 2011, Emergent BioSolutions Inc. announced that it, too, would be receiving “an award to supply the U.S. Government with 44.75 million doses of BioThrax (Anthrax Vaccine Absorbed) over a period of five years for a total value of up to $1.25 billion.” </div>
<div style="font-family: inherit">
<a href="http://www.biothrax.com/whatisbiothrax/">BioThrax</a>  is the version of the anthrax vaccine made solely by Emergent and, according to the Emergent website, a vaccine which has already been administered to 2.5 million people. Of course, Emergent does not explain who these 2.5 million people are or what social groups they tend to belong to. However, this vaccine no doubt carries with it all the dangers of the rest of the anthrax vaccines that have caused so much pain and suffering among those who have taken the shot. Patents and the detailed special touches of manufacturing make little difference when the basic chemical-laden principles of vaccination are followed.</div>
<div style="font-family: inherit">
Regardless, what is more disturbing than the adverse effects of the vaccine is the history of the bio-pharmaceutical company itself. </div>
<div style="font-family: inherit">
Emergent BioSolutions Inc. is much more than a mere recipient of government contracts to produce anthrax vaccines. Located in Rockville, Maryland, Emergent BioSolutions Inc. bears its name as a result of the massive company restructuring of BioPort Corporation. Initially, Emergent was constructed as a subsidiary of BioPort but, through the corporate restructuring mechanisms, eventually became the parent company to <a href="http://media.corporate-ir.net/media_files/irol/20/202582/irkit/S1A.pdf">BioPort</a>. </div>
<div style="font-family: inherit">
Up until around 2006, when BioPort was restructured into a subsidiary of Emergent, the company was the sole provider of the anthrax vaccine known as BioThrax that was used in the wake of the false flag anthrax scare of 2001. At that time, BioPort had only one customer — the US Department of Defense (DOD), and its one product was anthrax vaccine.  In addition to being the sole customer of BioPort, the DOD poured enormous amounts of money into the corporation, although it only provided a small fraction of the vaccine which it was contracted to produce.  In 1999, the DOD shoveled $18 million dollars of taxpayer money into BioPort. In 2000, it spent another $24 million.[1]   </div>
<div style="font-family: inherit">
At the time of the 2001 anthrax scare, BioPort was also the only US Corporation that was licensed to manufacture anthrax vaccine; a license which was acquired in a privatization effort where BioPort bought the laboratories of the Michigan Biologic Products Institute, the organization that was itself created to further the privatization of anthrax vaccine production that was initially <a href="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d02181t.pdf">overseen and undertaken</a> by the Michigan Department of Public Health. </div>
<div style="font-family: inherit">
Consequently, because it was the only producer of anthrax vaccine in 2001, BioPort made hefty profits from the spike in demand for the vaccine that followed the mysterious packages that killed five people. </div>
<div style="font-family: inherit">
In addition, the man who was ultimately blamed for the anthrax mailings, <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2008/aug/02/nation/na-anthrax2">Dr. Bruce Ivins</a>, was a co-owner of two patents  for the anthrax vaccine that BioPort sold after the initial panic ensued. Much of Dr. Ivins’ career was based on his attempt to fully understand the process of anthrax infection and isolate the specific toxin that was fatal. He apparently found this toxin and then attempted to build upon his knowledge in order to develop a vaccine that would protect humans from infection.  As the unfortunate patsy in the anthrax attacks, Ivins allegedly committed suicide in 2008.</div>
<div style="font-family: inherit">
Although the mainstream media tried to spin these connections between Ivins and the anthrax vaccine as evidence of available material and a motive of financial profit, neither of <a href="http://infowars.net/articles/august2008/220808Boyle.htm" style="color: red">these attempts</a> to lay the blame on Ivins held up. In fact, two former directors of the bacteriology division at Ft. Detrick <a href="http://www.infowars.com/scientific-impossibility-did-fbi-get-their-man-in-bruce-ivins/">directly contradicted the official story</a>  of Ivins’ involvement in the anthrax mailings. The directors even went so far as to say that it would have been impossible for Ivins to produce the powdered anthrax that was used within the timeframe claimed by the FBI. This sentiment has been echoed by many others close to this case as well. Interestingly enough, even the <a href="http://www.infowars.com/anthrax-attacks-justice-dept-destroys-fbi-case-then-does-a-180-reversal-days-later/">FBI has contradicted</a> the official story, of which it is the main purveyor. </div>
<div style="font-family: inherit">
<a href="http://www.rumormillnews.com/cgi-bin/archive.cgi?read=129171">Rumormillnews</a> even calls into question the claims made by the mainstream media that Ivins could have gained financially from his connections to the anthrax vaccine. Writing for Rumormillnews, Sharon Gilbert suggests that because Ivins was working for the US government, he was limited to $150,000 a year profit from any of his research, regardless of the increase in sales resulting from the panic.</div>
<div style="font-family: inherit">
Yet the association with Dr. Bruce Ivins is almost inconsequential compared to the ties BioPort (now Emergent) has with more sinister individuals and organizations. </div>
<div style="font-family: inherit">
Indeed, it has been reported that the Carlyle Group, an international consulting and investment firm, as well as defense contractor, is a major owner of BioPort. Although these reports were given some years ago, it is unlikely that the ownership of such a perfectly situated company (in terms of profits) has dramatically shifted.</div>
<div style="font-family: inherit">
For those who are unaware of the Carlyle Group, please read <a href="http://www.infowars.com/articles/military/carlyle_group_investing_war.htm">this article</a> or David Icke’s book <i>Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Center Disaster</i> for a brief overview on its history of treachery. The members of this group (i.e. George H.W. Bush, Donald Rumsfeld, Frank Carlucci, William E. Kennard, and many many others) are too many to list in this article, as are the connections that the Carlyle Group has to defense contractors, defense manufacturers, foreign governments, international banks and corporations, and even terrorist organizations. Needless to say, the Carlyle Group leaves a list of New World Order connections a mile long. This includes the bin Laden family who have been investors and clients of the organization in the past. </div>
<div style="font-family: inherit">
Members of the Carlyle Group, the US government, and even BioPort itself no doubt wish to keep these connections secret. In regards to the Carlyle Group connections specific to Bioport, however, investigative journalist <a href="http://www.skolnicksreport.com/ootar3.html">Sherman Skolnick</a>  wrote: </div>
<blockquote>
<p> Under the disguise of invoking national emergency provisions, George W. Bush has ordered National Guard sentries to guard the BioPort facility in Lansing, Michigan. Bush has ordered, under pretext of ‘national security’, that employees and officials of BioPort are forbidden to discuss with reporters, commentators, and researchers, the nature of the ownership of BioPort Corporation. This was done to preclude details of this private corporation from being publicly disclosed. This presidential edict was quietly put through just prior to the beginning of bombing by the U.S. of Afghanistan. Despite this clamp-down on disclosure, some very patriotic employees of BioPort have informed independent-minded commentators of the reputed ownership and operations details of BioPort Corporation.</p>
</blockquote>
<div style="font-family: inherit"> Indeed, the drastic measures taken to hide the true ownership and background of BioPort are necessary if one wishes to use this front company in order to prepare and facilitate another false flag attack. It would not be in the best interests of those such as the Carlyle Group, who would stand to make astronomical profits out of not just the increased sale of vaccines but also out of the increased police state machinery and war making materials that would ensue as a result of such a perceived “bio-attack.”</div>
<div style="font-family: inherit">
However, the revelation of Carlyle Group connections to BioPort are not as alarming as the connections between the bio-pharmaceutical front company and the bin Laden family. Yet these connections exist nonetheless, and not just through the tangled web of the Carlyle Group and international banks and corporations. Skolnick again writes that, “Another stockholder of BioPort Corp., is the Bin Laden Group, some 24 family members of which were whisked out of the U.S., on ‘safety’ reasons by the secret political police, the FBI, following the September 11, 2001 events.”</div>
<div style="font-family: inherit">
Indeed, <a href="http://investors.emergentbiosolutions.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=202582&amp;p=irol-govBio&amp;ID=158307">Fuad el-Hibri</a>, a Saudi businessman who has served as a representative for Saudi Arabian and other Middle Eastern interests, serves as Emergent’s Chairman of the Board of Directors. El-Hibri has been reported to be a supporter of Osama bin Laden the individual and the bin Laden family as a whole. It should also be mentioned that El-Hibri is himself a major shareholder in the company.</div>
<div style="font-family: inherit">
To further demonstrate the virtually endless number of unfortunate connections maintained by BioPort/Emergent, it is important to note that Admiral William Crowe was (shortly after the attacks) a 13% owner in BioPort. Crowe had served as the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff when American-produced weapons-grade anthrax was being shipped to Saddam Hussein for use in the war against Iran. He also served under former Secretary of Defense Frank Carlucci, a chairman of the Carlyle Group. Crowe is also a member of the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR). </div>
<div style="font-family: inherit">
While, at first glance, these connections may seem trivial, the fact is that in the world of false flag terror, a web of interconnected and interrelated organizations, front companies, and government agencies etc. is both a necessary and available prerequisite. In 2011, these resources are clearly available and they are clearly effective. Indeed, they have been accessed many times before. </div>
<div style="font-family: inherit">
These recent announcements of vaccine contracts may be just another complete waste of taxpayer money. However, as I said in my conclusion to the last article I wrote on this issue, we cannot afford to simply dismiss the potential buildup to false flag terror as mere government stupidity. </div>
<div style="font-family: inherit">
At the very least, the connections between these various groups and individuals are concerning. Yet the fallout from a staged “bio-attack” would be disastrous. The US government has clearly expressed a disdain for civil liberties and has openly (relatively speaking) sought out ways in which to curtail these freedoms. An anthrax attack, real or staged, would provide them the perfect opportunity to do just that.</div>

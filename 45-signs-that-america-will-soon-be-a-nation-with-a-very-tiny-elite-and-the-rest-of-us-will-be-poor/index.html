<p>The middle class is being systematically wiped out of existence in  the United States today.  America is a nation with a very tiny elite  that is rapidly becoming increasingly wealthy while everyone else is  becoming poorer.</p>
<p>So why is this happening?  Well, it is actually very  simple.  Our institutions are designed to concentrate wealth in the  hands of a very limited number of people.</p>
<p>Throughout human history,  almost all societies that have had a big centralized government have  also had a very high concentration of wealth in the hands of the elite.   Throughout human history, almost all societies that have allowed big  business or big corporations to dominate the economy have also had a  very high concentration of wealth in the hands of the elite.  Well, the  United States has allowed both big government and big corporations to  grow wildly out of control.  Those were huge mistakes.  Our founding  fathers attempted to establish a nation where the federal government  would be greatly limited and where corporations would be greatly  restricted.  Unfortunately, we have turned our backs on those principles  and now we are paying the price.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>When you have great concentrations of wealth and power, the economic rewards of a society tend to go to just a few.</p>
<p>In the United States today, big businesses and wealthy individuals  fund the campaigns of our politicians, and in turn our politicians pass  laws which rig the game in their favor.  It is a symbiotic relationship  which is very bad for America.</p>
<div align="center">
</div>
<p>
Sadly, most conservatives tend to cheer on the big corporations, but this is <i>not</i>  how our founding fathers envisioned our capitalist system working.  Our  founding fathers envisioned large numbers of similar companies  competing against one another for customers.  They did not envision a  very small number of giant corporations buying up all of their  competitors or smashing them into oblivion with their giant piles of  money.</p>
<p>True conservatives should want to see more competition instead of  less competition.  Competition helped make America great, and we need to  get back to that.</p>
<p>Instead of an economic landscape dominated by monolithic predator  corporations, we need an economic environment where millions of small  businesses can thrive and compete directly with one another.</p>
<p>Our founding fathers never intended for us to have the kind of system that we have today.  As I have discussed in <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/corporatism-is-not-capitalism-7-things-about-the-monolithic-predator-corporations-that-dominate-our-economy-that-every-american-should-know" title="previous articles">previous articles</a>,  our founding fathers greatly restricted the size and scope of  corporations in early America.  The following is how author Stephen D.  Foster Jr. described the attitude toward corporations <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/corporatism-is-not-capitalism-7-things-about-the-monolithic-predator-corporations-that-dominate-our-economy-that-every-american-should-know" title="in the early years of the United States">in the early years of the United States</a>….</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>The East India Company was the largest corporation of  its day and its dominance of trade angered the colonists so much, that  they dumped the tea products it had on a ship into Boston Harbor which  today is universally known as the Boston Tea Party. At the time, in  Britain, large corporations funded elections generously and its stock  was owned by nearly everyone in parliament. The founding fathers did not  think much of these corporations that had great wealth and great  influence in government. And that is precisely why they put restrictions  upon them after the government was organized under the Constitution.</i> </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><i>After the nation’s founding, corporations were granted charters  by the state as they are today. Unlike today, however, corporations were  only permitted to exist 20 or 30 years and could only deal in one  commodity, could not hold stock in other companies, and their property  holdings were limited to what they needed to accomplish their business  goals. And perhaps the most important facet of all this is that most  states in the early days of the nation had laws on the books that made  any political contribution by corporations a criminal offense.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A giant central government that spends more than 20 percent of our GDP is a collectivist institution. Enormous predator corporations that are constantly sucking up even more money and power are collectivist institutions.</p>
<p>Our founding fathers did not intend for our society to be dominated by collectivist institutions. Very large institutions tend to reward the people that own and run them at the expense of everyone else.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/goingglobal.html" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/_qLAIskTQXUc/TZ9T4BhStII/AAAAAAAAIHA/WjeJNPu91cA/Banner1_180x150.jpg"></a>And you know what? A lot of these giant corporations have figured out that they don’t even need American workers anymore.</p>
<p>Instead, many of them are shipping our jobs to the other side of the  world where it it legal to pay slave labor wages.  That means bigger  profits for them but less jobs for the rest of us.</p>
<p>In America today, the rich are getting richer and the poor are  getting poorer, and big government and big corporations are the  mechanisms by which this is happening.</p>
<p>Posted below are 45 signs that America will soon be a nation with a very tiny elite and the rest of us will be poor….</p>
<p><b>#1</b> Increasingly, gains in income are becoming very  highly concentrated at the top of the food chain in America.  The  following is how income gains in the United States were distributed <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/8omCy.png" target="_blank" title="during 2010">during 2010</a>….<br />
-37 percent of all income gains went to the top 0.01 percent of all income earners<br />
-56 percent of all income gains went to the rest of the top 1 percent<br />
-7 percent of all income gains went to the bottom 99 percent</p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p><b>#45</b> The amount of money that the federal government gives directly to Americans has increased <a href="http://news.investors.com/Article/598993/201201260805/entitlements-soar-under-president-obama.htm" target="_blank" title="by 32 percent">by 32 percent</a> since Barack Obama entered the White House.</p>
<p>As the middle class is systematically destroyed, families are looking for ways to survive any way that they can.</p>
<p>Why do you think that <a href="http://finance.fortune.cnn.com/2012/04/02/dollar-stores/?" target="_blank" title="dollar stores">dollar stores</a> are absolutely thriving these days? It is because that is the only place many families can afford to shop.</p>
<p>So what is the solution?</p>
<p>Well, many liberals claim that the solution is to tax the wealthy and redistribute their money to the poor. But that is definitely <i>not</i> the answer. That would give the wealthy more of an incentive to take their wealth  and their businesses out of the United States, and it would give the  poor more of an incentive to sit around and not work.</p>
<p>When I was younger, if I could have gotten the government to pay my  bills I probably never would have worked at all.  I was quite lazy and I  probably would have been more than happy to sit at home and collect  government checks.</p>
<p>It is only human nature not to work hard when you have someone else  willing to take care of you.  For example, Vice-President Joe Biden  recently revealed that he stayed in the U.S. Senate for so long because  he didn’t want “<a href="http://www.wnd.com/2012/04/joe-biden-i-wouldnt-want-a-real-job/?cat_orig=us" target="_blank" title="a real job">a real job</a>“.  There is a part of all of us that would like to avoid hard work.</p>
<p>So redistributing wealth is not going to be good for society as a  whole.  It penalizes being productive and it rewards being lazy.</p>
<p>And our tax system is already way too oppressive for those that honestly pay their taxes. Did you know that the average American must work <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2012/04/02/pf/taxes/tax-freedom-day/index.htm?iid=Lead" target="_blank" title="107 days">107 days</a> just to make enough money to pay their taxes?</p>
<p>That is before a single penny is earned for anything else. That is absolutely obscene!</p>
<p>This year, the average American will spend approximately <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2012/04/02/pf/taxes/tax-freedom-day/index.htm?iid=Lead" target="_blank" title="29 percent">29 percent</a> of what they make on federal, state and local taxes.</p>
<p>No, the truth is that our current tax system is horrific and it needs to be thrown out. But that is a topic for another article.</p>
<p>Getting back to the dying middle class, the real answer is to break  up big government and to break up the big corporations and promote  competition in our economy once again. We need wealth and power to be spread out into millions and millions of hands.</p>
<p>We need a system that tremendously encourages small businesses instead of absolutely crushing them.</p>
<p>We need dozens of competitors in most industries instead of just a handful.</p>
<p>We need to empower average Americans to be their own bosses instead of being dependent on big government and big corporations.</p>
<p>We need a system that gives “the little guy” a fighting chance.</p>
<p>It could be done if the American people were willing to reign in big government and the big corporations.</p>
<p>If you believe in the U.S. Constitution, you should believe in  limiting the power of the federal government and limiting the power of  the big corporations. Those are principles that our founding fathers believed in, and those are principles that we need to return to.</p>

<a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2015/02/whats-really-behind-current-measles.html"><b>Activist Post</b></a></p>
<p>In this nation of over 300 million, a little over a hundred cases of  measles have been reported with no deaths. Some epidemic. Why is  everyone so concerned? How many epidemic scares have we seen in the past  few years? Both swine flu scares, SARS, bird flu, H1N1 flu, the Ebola  scare and wasn’t heterosexual AIDS predicted to wipe out a quarter of  the earth’s population? And this is only a partial list! As George  Carlin once said, “Americans panic easily.”</p>
<p>But who can blame us when the “experts” say terrible things are going  to happen and the media doesn’t give the other side of a story? The  media merely parrots the official medical party line and even ignores  and mocks those with opposing views. The fact that they’ve been wrong  every time doesn’t matter; people still freak out when told, “It’s  coming and it’s gonna be bad this time.”</p>
<p><b>What exactly is measles?</b></p>
<p><a name="more"></a>Measles is a short-lived viral infection that begins with a fever  that lasts for a couple of days, followed by a cough, runny nose and  conjunctivitis (pink eye). A rash starts on the face, hairline and upper  neck, spreads down the back and trunk, and extends to the extremities.  After about 5 days, the rash fades.</p>
<p><b>How dangerous is measles?</b></p>
<p>Measles is a mild and harmless disease that leaves a stronger,  healthier child in its wake; most adults today who were born before 1965  got measles and have lifelong immunity as a result. Serious problems  from measles are very, very rare. This, by the way, was standard medical  policy; measles was just a rite of passage. It changed when the measles  vaccine came on the market in the 1960s. Suddenly this mild, beneficial  rite of passage became a deadly disease.</p>
<p>Some MDs still don’t buy the hype. As Jay Gordon, MD, former UCLA Medical Center pediatrician recently said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This measles outbreak does not pose a great risk to a  healthy child and quite frankly I don’t think it poses any risk to a  healthy child. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>

<p><b>How deadly is measles compared to the measles shot?</b></p>
<p>Dr. Anne Schuchat, director of CDC’s National Center for Immunization  and Respiratory Diseases, in an Associated Press interview in 2014  stated that there have been no measles deaths in the US since 2003. (<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr59/nvsr59_04.pdf">Source</a>, <a href="http://vaccineimpact.com/2015/zero-u-s-measles-deaths-in-10-years-but-over-100-measles-vaccine-deaths-reported/#sthash.jsHvonAX.dpuf">Source</a>)</p>
<p>However, the CDC’s National Vital Statistics Reports show 2 deaths associated with measles for <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr59/nvsr59_04.pdf">2009</a> and <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr61/nvsr61_04.pdf">2010</a>.</p>
<p><b>Now let’s look at this measles vaccine</b></p>
<p><i>“Pediatricians continue to defend vaccination to the death.  The question parents should be asking is, ‘Whose death?’”</i> Robert Mendelsohn, MD</p>
<p>Another government reporting agency, The National Vaccine Adverse  Event Reporting System (VAERS), reports <a href="http://www.medalerts.org/vaersdb/index.php">108 children died from the  measles vaccine during a ten year period</a>. But that may be a fraction of the real number because MDs often do not report vaccine injuries.</p>
<p>Death certificates, usually filled out by MDs, very rarely mention  vaccination as the cause of death. They may write encephalitis or brain  inflammation rather than vaccination even though vaccines can cause  brain inflammation) on the death certificate. We don’t know the real  number of vaccine injuries and deaths. But they are most likely much  greater than what VAERS reports due to underreporting.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/vaccinetruth.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" height="175" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-38G3VOJQToQ/TfAZ2bc-qRI/AAAAAAAAJQ8/LA-TGAvVeWk/250x250-b.jpg" width="200"></a>According to Dr. David Kessler, former head of the Food and Drug  Administration, “Only about 1 percent of serious events [adverse drug  reactions] are reported to the FDA.” Kessler DA, Natanblut S, Kennedy D.  et al. Introducing MEDWatch A New Approach to Reporting Medication and  Device Adverse Effects and Product Problems. <i>JAMA</i>. 1993;269(21):2765-2768.</p>
<p>We don’t know how many vaccine injuries and deaths there are but if  we apply the above underreporting number to vaccine injuries then  possibly as many as 10,800 children might have been harmed or killed by  the measles vaccine during the period that at most four died from  measles.</p>
<p>In addition two serious diseases rarely found in the non-vaccinated:</p>
<p><b>Atypical measles </b></p>
<p>Atypical measles occurs only in the vaccinated and can be fatal. <a href="http://www.cdph.ca.gov/HealthInfo/discond/Pages/Measles.aspx">(Source)</a></p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

</script></div>

<p>Atypical measles was initially thought to occur only in those who  received the killed measles vaccine, but several investigators have  reported this illness in children who had been vaccinated only with the  live measles vaccine.</p>
<p>Nichols EM. Atypical measles: a continuing problem. <i>Am J Public Health.</i> 1979;69(2):160-162 <a href="http://healthimpactnews.com/2013/outbreaks-of-measles-in-vaccinated-children-intensifying/#sthash.kXoMlUEy.dpuf">(Source)</a></p>
<p><b>SSPE</b></p>
<p>The measles vaccine can also cause subacute sclerosing  panencephalitis (SSPE), which is 100% fatal, in a very small number of  children. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>SSPE is a progressive neurological disorder of children  and young adults that affects the central nervous system (CNS). It is a  slow, but persistent, viral infection caused by defective measles virus.<a href="http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/subacute_panencephalitis/subacute_panencephalitis.htm">(Source)</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Measles amongst the non-vaccinated?</b></p>
<p>The Amish are a religious community the vast majority of which are not vaccinated. They reported not a single case of measles between 1970 and 1987. <i>Sutter RW, Markowitz LE, Bennetch JM, Morris W, Zell ER, Preblud SR. Measles among the Amish: a comparative study of measles severity in primary and secondary cases in households. J Infect Dis. 1991 Jan;163(1):12-6.</i> While the local highly‐vaccinated communities still reported epidemics every 2‐3 year.  Based on this experience measles appears to circulate more amongst the vaccinated than the non-vaccinated.<b> </b></p>
<p><b>Vaccine recalls</b></p>
<p>However useful or safe properly manufactured, distributed and  administered vaccines might be in theory — and the jury is still out on  the issues of safety and efficacy for a number of vaccines — vaccine  experts have repeatedly reversed themselves about the safety or  effectiveness of vaccines they have previously sworn were safe.  Science  often provides an imperfect answer.</p>
<p>Properly tested and licensed vaccines were later found to cause  injury and death and were stopped by vaccines authorities.  A 1993 MMR  vaccine was found to cause mumps and encephalitis Sawada eta. 1993;  Lancet 342 (7 August): 371 the Edmondson-Zagreb measles vaccine was  stopped because children had an increased rick of death from other  diseases years after vaccination Weiss, R. 1992.  Measles battle loses  potent weapon.<i>Science; 258 (23 October): 546-547 </i>the pertussis  (whooping cough) vaccine was boycotted by doctors in Japan after 57  severe reactions and 37 deaths.

<p><b>Did vaccines eradicate measles?</b></p>
<p>Deaths from measles, scarlet fever, typhoid, whooping cough, and  diphtheria were down up to 99% BEFORE vaccination. The vaccines did  nothing to increase the downward trend and may have kept the diseases  from disappearing due to “viral shedding.”<a href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/salud/salud_vacunas145.htm">(Source)</a></p>

<p>
The measles shot can only be said to work if it worked backwards in  time. After the shot came out the drop in measles deaths stabilized. </p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both;text-align: center"><a href="https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/d9d4a445-a3e2-40c1-b653-03d9ae8d9fed.png" style="margin-left: 1em;margin-right: 1em"><img border="0" src="https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/d9d4a445-a3e2-40c1-b653-03d9ae8d9fed.png" height="300" width="540"></a></div>
<p>
What caused the great drop? Clean water, sanitation, indoor toilets, hot  and cold running water, less crowding and improved living conditions  resulted in better resistance to disease. Medicine had comparatively  little to do with it. You can’t cure an epidemic by throwing chemicals  at it. By the way, there was no vaccine for scarlet fever yet deaths  dropped just the same. Why? More proof that factors other than  vaccination had the major role in decreasing deaths from childhood  disease.</p>
<p><b>Autism and measles vaccine– coincidence?</b></p>
<p><i>Who are you going to believe, me or your own eyes? </i><b>– </b>Chico Marx in <i>Duck Soup</i> <i>(movie)</i></p>
<p>Some medical experts say that they have proven that the measles  vaccine does not cause autism yet mothers across America and around the  world report a different experience.</p>
<p>A mother brings her healthy child to the pediatrician for a measles  shot. An hysterical mother calls soon afterwards saying something is  wrong. Perhaps the child had a seizure shortly after the visit or spiked  a high fever, slept for an entire day, stopped speaking, forgot his  letters, no longer makes eye contact, is spinning in circles, is  screaming and is no longer the child he was a few days ago. Sometimes  the child dies (referred to as SIDS or crib death).</p>
<p>Such events are reported repeatedly by mothers around the world after various vaccinations.</p>
<p>In fact since 1987 the federal gov’t has paid over $3 billion to  families whose child has died or been maimed for life after such an  experience.</p>
<p>“It’s just a coincidence,” the pediatrician says.</p>
<p>But when he gets the same call about another child in his practice  what does he say then? “These vaccines are safe, the government says  so”?</p>
<p>But when another, and another and another mother gives a similar  story asking, “What did you do to my child?” How many times will the  pediatrician say, “It’s just a coincidence”?</p>
<p>This happens over and over – when do you allow parents to stop the  shots? Who is right, the mother or the doctor? A medical researcher once  told me, “Always go with the mother’s observation. She knows her child  best.”</p>
<p>The government says your child must be vaccinated, I say, let the mother choose.</p>
<p>Even today the vaccination-mandate zealots belittle and dismiss the concerns of all parents by questioning their intelligence. <a href="http://slate.me/1A3oNGg" target="_blank">(Source)</a></p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>Today’s medical denial of the vaccine-autism link reminds me of a  scene in the Marx Brothers’ movie <i>Duck Soup</i> where Chico is caught  red-handed dallying with a pretty young woman. He denies it adding, “Who  are you going to believe, me or your own eyes?”</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/noglasses.html" rel="nofollow" style="float: right;margin-left: 1em;margin-bottom: 0em"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-9NVXYpcxdr8/UHMzaY7R2OI/AAAAAAAAAPU/enRFdAsV4co/s300/ad5%25285%2529.jpg" alt=""></a><b>Measles vaccine-autism link?</b></p>
<p>Government authorities say they are confident they have proven that  no link exists.  Is this enough to force parents to vaccinate their  children?</p>
<p>Autism affects as many as 1 in 50 children but a few decades ago  (when vaccines were few) autism rates were 1 in 10,000. When will they  stop the shots? When it’s one in two?</p>
<p>We should note an interesting phenomenon: immigrants who come to the  US from native lands that have never known autism (they don’t even have a  word for it) suddenly find their American-born (and vaccinated)  children develop autism and other neurological disorders. <a href="https://www.autismspeaks.org/science/science-news/study-finds-high-rate-autism-among-minneapolis-somali-community">(Source)</a></p>
<p><b>Say no to drugs</b></p>
<p>Vaccines are unsafe and ineffective. It’s time we simply said no to  drugs – especially these drugs. They are creating a generation of sick  children and bankrupting their parents.</p>
<p>When I was in a large elementary school in New York I remember seeing  three or four kids in a special class who were brain injured or had  birth injuries. They were few. Years later entire classrooms would be  devoted to brain injured (autistic and otherwise) children. Now there  are entire schools for these children.</p>
<p>Are we so sure that vaccines do not contribute to at least some of this  damage to eliminate a parent’s right to choose not to expose their  children to the possibility that vaccines might contribute to that  damage?</p>
<p>Despite the billions spent on media hype and corporate research  science can never prove a negative. Repeatedly experts have told us they  know the truth, to change their minds later. No studies trying to  placate an increasingly concerned public, no media hype designed to  humiliate parental vaccine doubters can stop vaccine-damaged kids from  coming whatever the source. For many patients the vaccine decision comes  down to a child having a week lost from school or the possibility of a  lifetime lost.</p>
<p>Sadly, autism is just the tip of the iceberg. We have a generation of  chronically ill children. Today one in six children has  neurodevelopmental disorders, one in eleven has asthma, one in twelve  has food allergies, and one in 400 has diabetes. Let’s not forget ADD,  ADHD, dyslexia, “processing disorders,” vision and hearing disorders,  digestive disorders, immune system disorders and more. It’s getting  worse.</p>
<p>For how long will parents be denied the truth? They know their child.  They even have videos of their child before and after the shot – it’s  not the same child. Whatever shots are doing they are not preventing  children from getting sicker. They are not preventing autism and the  growing number of health problems faced by children.</p>
<p>As Viera Scheibner, Ph.D. writes in <i>British Medical Journal Rapid Response</i> 24 March 2005:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The fact is that there IS evidence of the causal link  between MMR and autism – perhaps the best one is that the autistic  children are the living proof documented by many of their parents’  videos ‘before’ and ‘after’… However not just is there an obvious  temporal association but all the criteria for establishing a causal link  set by “the father of medical statistics”, Bradford Hill (1969) “The  environment and disease: association or causation?”,<i> Proc Royal Soc Med:</i>295-300 are met, including very importantly, biological plausibility.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a debate on this issue – why does the media, the  pharmaceutical companies and many medical doctors ignore this and assume  the matter is settled?</p>
<p>Much research links autism and vaccination. Here is one link <a href="http://experimentalvaccines.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/86-Research-Papers-Supporting-the-Vaccine-Autism-Link.pdf">citing  97 research papers connecting autism and vaccines</a>. At the least there is  controversy so why not err on the side of caution?</p>
<p>Why should government strong-arm tactics and media hype override what  parents believe on their own experience and scientists find in study  after study?</p>
<p>While it may not be conclusive, any argument that says, “We have  proven that there is no link” is also not conclusive. Why should the  government prevent parents from erring on the side of caution?</p>
<p><b>Why do they call them childhood diseases?</b></p>
<p>Why do they call measles, mumps, chicken pox and the rest childhood diseases?</p>
<p>This is not a trick question. The answer is simple; they were  contracted during childhood. Not as a baby, not as an adult, teenager,  or – but a child usually around ages 4,5,6,7. It happens after you’ve  used up the immunity you got from your mother (known as passive  immunity).</p>
<p>When I was a kid almost nobody got measles in high school. You rarely  if ever heard of an infant getting measles. But now newborns, infants,  babies, teenagers and adults get measles and other “childhood” diseases.  Why aren’t they childhood diseases like they used to be? It’s because  vaccination has altered the natural immunity cycles.</p>
<p>Some research reveals that childhood vaccination appears to upset the  age of occurrence of disease and is responsible for babies and adults  getting these diseases – ages when they are more dangerous and even  fatal. <a href="http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/dangers-of-childhood-diseases-for-adults">(Source)</a> It is important for people to get measles when they are children. Not  before and not after.</p>
<p>Vaccination disturbs this natural order of life.</p>
<p><b>California Measles Surveillance Update February 13, 2015</b></p>
<p>Since December 2014, there have been 113 confirmed measles cases reported in California residents.</p>

<p>
As you can see from the above chart the majority of those that got the  “childhood disease” measles were not children. They were infants and  adults. Why?</p>
<p><b>What changed things?</b></p>
<p>When little girls normally got measles and other childhood diseases  they developed full immunity and years later they were able to pass on  that immunity to their unborn child. Their baby is born protected  against measles and lots of other diseases from the protection the  mother passes on during pregnancy through the placenta (hence the term  “transplacental” immunity). Breastfeeding also permits the baby to  obtain additional immune factors from the mother.</p>
<p><b>Vaccinations interfere with transplacental immunity</b></p>
<p>One unanswered question is: when a little girl is vaccinated is she  not able to develop full natural immunity? She passes on less immune  factors to her unborn child. It has been shown that breastfed infants of  vaccinated mothers have nearly three times the risk of measles  infection compared to those of naturally immune mothers.  In 1963 the  measles vaccine was introduced and the following was discovered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Infants whose mothers were born after 1963 had a measles  attack rate of 33%, compared to 12% for infants of older mothers.  Infants whose mothers were born after 1963 are more susceptible to  measles than are infants of older mothers. An increasing proportion of infants  born in the United States may be susceptible to measles. . . Papania M.  et al., Increased susceptibility to measles in infants in the United  States, <i>Pediatrics</i>, November 1999, Vol. 1045, No. 5, e59, pp. 1-6.</p>

<p>Are babies today getting measles because their mothers were vaccinated and stopped long-term breastfeeding?</p>

<p>Is that why newborns and infants today can develop what used to be  “childhood” diseases? Vaccine mandates are imposed upon millions of  children without addressing this question.</p>

<p>In addition to live and killed bacteria, viruses and their toxins,  children are injected with some of the most lethal poisons known:  formaldehyde, mercury, aluminum, phenol (carbolic acid), borax (ant  killer), ethylene glycol (antifreeze), dye, acetone (nail polish  remover), latex, MSG, glycerol, polysorbate 80/20, sorbitol, monkey,  cow, chick, pig, sheep and dog tissues and cells (may be contaminated  with animal viruses), gelatin, casein, fragments of human fetus cells,  human viruses, antibiotics, genetically modified yeast, animal,  bacterial and viral DNA (may affect recipient’s DNA) – all of these  substances are contained in one or more vaccines.</p>
<p>It is scientifically established that mercury poisons the nervous  system Vimy MJ, Lorscheider FL. Faculty of Medicine, Univ. Of Calgary,  July 1991. (Study findings) &amp; <i>J. Trace Elem.

<p><b>Synergy</b></p>
<p>While mercury is not in the MMR shot even more significant is that  the synergistic effect of adding many of the vaccine’s ingredients  together have not been studied in children. We really don’t know what  the chemicals we are putting into children does to them.</p>
<p>More and more vaccines are recommended and mandated (101 vaccines in  multiple doses by the time a child is child age (CDC recommended  vaccination schedule 2015) and yet the safety of the entire vaccine  schedule has not been studied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is indisputable that the vaccination schedule has  never been tested for safety in its entirety, or in the way that it is  administered. In other words, while the government renews, licenses, and  compels individual vaccines, it does not test – or require vaccine  makes to test – the safety and efficacy of vaccines given simultaneously  or the cumulative effects of multiple vaccines.<i> </i> </p>

<p><b>On a personal note</b></p>
<p>My work investigating the issue of vaccination reached a new level of  clinical insight after developing <i><b>Koren Specific Technique</b></i>; a  healthcare protocol used to determine if a patient has toxic, emotional  or structural stress causing or contributing to their problems. I  consistently found that autistic children revealed greater toxicity than  non-vaccinated children.</p>

<p>The hygienic school is a long-standing approach towards health that  sees the body acting intelligently and that symptoms serve a purpose. By  suppressing symptoms we interfere with body function and drive disease  deeper.</p>
<p>The child experiences physical and mental growth spurts following a  childhood infectious disease. That is noticed in cultures all over the  world. For example, in India measles is referred to as “visitation from a  goddess.” As the medical historian Harris Coulter, PhD writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Contracting and overcoming childhood diseases are  part of a developmental process that actually helps develop a healthy,  robust, adult immune system able to meet the challenges that inevitable  encounters with viruses and bacteria will present later on.</p>

<p>A logical person, reading the above, would take their child to a  measles party and never give the measles vaccine to them. But with  vaccination we’re usually dealing with emotion, not logic. We’re dealing  with fear mongering from the medical profession and the media. Hence  the uproar over a mild condition that is ultimately a blessing in  disguise.</p>
<p>The vaccine-mandate zealots move forwards with more and more vaccines  to be given to our children (and adults) without addressing these very  important questions – questions that might have life or death  significance.</p>

<p>The vaccine-mandate zealots believe they have the facts, all the  facts, and nothing but the facts. However the reality is that they are  often mistaken.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A: Yes. In 2000, the United States declared that measles was eliminated  from this country.

<p>How many children must die, be crippled physically and mentally and  live lost lives before we recognize what we have done? In our worship of  technology when will we recognize our hubris and realize that we are  not God?  We do not know enough to justify mandating <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/imz/child-adolescent.html">101 vaccinations  from birth, for every single child</a>.</p>
<p>What should we do about measles epidemics?  We must work with nature.  Since measles returns cyclically irrespective of vaccination rates,  returning to traditional healing wisdom will return us to a time when  autism, allergies, asthma, diabetes and other illnesses seen so often in  children today will once again be rare or non-existent. That is what  led Dr. Robert Mendelsohn, the famous pediatrician and anti-vaccination  campaigner to say, “One grandmother is worth two MDs.”</p>
<p>A sick child needs love, nourishment, comfort and support while they  are going through a healing crisis no matter what the cause.  Natural,  non-suppressive healthcare systems such as chiropractic, homeopathy,  naturopathy, herbalism, Chinese Medicine, Indian Medicine and many other  “natural” systems work with the body.</p>
<p>Researchers, medical doctors and health educators need to remember  our place in nature, acknowledge our limitations and learn some  humility. In our struggle to “conquer” disease we have unleashed an  epidemic of chronically ill children who would have been far better had  we not interfered with natural diseases and instead worked with the  natural cycles of life; recognizing that the wisdom that permeates  nature is wiser than us all.</p>

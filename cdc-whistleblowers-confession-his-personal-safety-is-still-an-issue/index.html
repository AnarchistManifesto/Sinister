<p>On August 27, CDC whistleblower William Thompson came out of the shadows and admitted he had omitted vital data from a 2004 study on the MMR vaccine and its connection to autism. </p>
<p><a href="http://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2014/08/27/the-big-one-cdc-whistleblower-goes-public-now/">Thompson’s official statement was released</a> through his Cincinnati attorney, Rick Morgan. </p>
<p>The key piece in Thompson’s statement is: </p>
<p><a name="more"></a>“I regret that my coauthors and I omitted statistically significant information in our 2004 article published in the journal <i>Pediatrics</i>. The omitted data suggested that African American males who received the MMR vaccine before age 36 months were at increased risk for autism. Decisions were made regarding which findings to report after the data were collected, and I believe that the final study protocol was not followed.” </p>
<p>“My concern has been the decision to omit relevant findings in a particular study for a particular sub group for a particular vaccine. There have always been recognized risks for vaccination and I believe it is the responsibility of the CDC to properly convey the risks associated with receipt of those vaccines.” </p>
<p>Everything else in Thompson’s statement is backfill and back-pedaling and legal positioning and self-protection. </p>
<p>But this part, this is big. Within Thompson’s community of researchers and the general world of medical research and publishing, people know what it means. </p>
<p>It means major fraud. </p>

</div>
<p>Thompson, a co-author of the 2004 study, published in the prestigious journal <i>Pediatrics</i>, is admitting to egregious fraud. Cooking the data. </p>
<p>(Here are the authors and the name and reference number of the study in question: DeStefano F, Bhasin TK, Thompson WW, Yeargin-Allsopp M, Boyle C. “Age at first measles-mumps-rubella vaccination in children with autism and school-matched control subjects: a population-based study in metropolitan atlanta.” Pediatrics. 2004;3:259–266. The link to this study is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14754936">here</a>.) </p>
<p>In particular, omitting data which showed that African-American male babies who received the MMR vaccine were at a 340% increased risk of autism. </p>
<p>Omitting the data concealed this alarming fact from African-American families; and it also skewed the overall conclusion of the study, in order to exonerate the toxic MMR vaccine and give it a free pass. </p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>You would be hard-pressed to find a researcher of Thompson’s reputation and position who has ever come out and confessed: My colleagues and I committed fraud; we published the fraud; we stood by the fraud for 10 years. </p>
<p>Scandal. </p>
<p>Major scandal. It directly indicts Thompson’s co-authors of the 2004 study, including the lead author, <a href="http://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2014/08/29/cnn-asks-serial-lying-liar-to-comment-on-the-cdc-whistleblower-scandal/">Frank DeStefano</a>, who is also a CDC executive in charge of vaccine safety issues. </p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/vaccinetruth.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" height="175" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-38G3VOJQToQ/TfAZ2bc-qRI/AAAAAAAAJQ8/LA-TGAvVeWk/250x250-b.jpg" width="200"></a>Now add to that: concealing the dangers of the MMR vaccine for ten years has resulted in untold numbers of cases of autism that could have been prevented. </p>
<p>Damaged lives of children. Damaged families. </p>
<p>Again, this is not someone coming in from the outside to criticize a published study. This is one of the co-authors of the study. </p>
<p>Thompson was there in 2004. He knows what happened. He participated, along with his colleagues, in a cover-up. </p>
<p>His co-authors are all recognized figures in the world of vaccine research: DeStefano; Tanya Karapurkar-Bhasin; Marshalyn Yeargin-Allsop; and Coleen Boyle. </p>
<p>They have all defended the safety of vaccines in other studies, <a href="http://experimentalvaccines.org/2014/08/27/cdc-fraud-leads-to-rise-in-autism/">which are now thrown into doubt</a>. As in: dominoes falling. </p>
<p>Add these factors up and you get: front-page news. </p>
<p>You get a retraction of the 2004 study by <i>Pediatrics</i>, the journal that published it. </p>
<p>You get at least a cosmetic investigation of CDC practices by an outside special prosecutor. </p>
<p>You at least get a cosmetic Congressional hearing. </p>
<p>You get statements from Thompson’s co-authors. (So far, only Frank DeStefano has commented publicly, to reporter Sharyl Attkisson. His stuttering remarks are so garbled and nonsensical, they belong in a bad parody of science-speak.) </p>
<p>What have we gotten as a result of whistleblower Thompson’s confession? </p>
<p>From official sources: nothing of note. Zero. </p>
<p>From the mainstream press: nothing. Barely a whisper of coverage. </p>
<p>As I reported the other day, CNN ran a piece in which they called on co-author-of-fraud, DeStefano himself, to comment on the fraud, as if he were an outside objective expert. That’s quite a piece of journalism. DeStefano promptly invented a yarn about autism developing in utero, thus “proving” that vaccines couldn’t be responsible for autism. </p>
<p>William Thompson still has his job at the CDC. He has his lawyer, Rick Morgan. He undoubtedly has more knowledge and leads concerning fraud and lying about vaccines at the CDC. </p>
<p>Now we come to the issue of Thompson’s personal safety. </p>
<p>Apparently, there are people who take him seriously when he writes in his August 27 confession: “My colleagues and supervisors at the CDC have been entirely professional since this matter became public. In fact, I received a performance-based award after this story came out. I have experienced no pressure or retaliation and certainly was not escorted from the building, as some have stated.” </p>
<p>Thompson’s colleagues and supervisors at the CDC have been “entirely professional” because they’re in a box. Thompson’s name is out there. Even before his name was out there, his anonymous audio confession was available online, and Dr. Brian Hooker, to whom he confessed, and Andrew Wakefield knew who he was. </p>
<p>In fact, many people knew the title of the fraudulent 2004 study, and anyone could read the names of the authors and figure out the identity of the whistleblower. </p>
<p>Thompson was actually getting protection from online alternative media. </p>
<p>Making it more difficult for the CDC to take punitive action against him. </p>
<p>And what about Thompson’s claim that he received a performance-based honorary CDC award since “the story came out”? An award based on what? His exposure of fraud at the CDC? You mean someone took an old photo of Thompson and typed under it, “Good work, Bill”? </p>
<p>If this award referred to other work Thompson did before the scandal blew up, it was given to him, rather than canceled, for appearance’s sake only. As if to say: “The CDC welcomes internal criticism from its own employees.” </p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>Thompson claims he was not escorted from the campus at the CDC, once the scandal began to blow up. I wrote that he was escorted off the scene. I consider the source on this reliable. I relayed this information to another source close to Thompson, who said he hadn’t heard that, but that Thompson “had a problem with security guards” at the CDC campus. </p>
<p>There are actually people who believe Thompson has sailed through this whole scandal, so far, with nary a single problem at his workplace, the CDC, and that the CDC is a peachy keen place for employees and is eager to correct its own mistakes. </p>
<p>It’s all very professional and wonderful, and when an internal whistleblower confesses to a very serious crime of fraud, the boys and girls gather around a table and say, “Gee, Bill, show us exactly where an error was made in this study, so we can examine it. We just want to get things right.” </p>
<p>If that were true, why was William Thompson hiding in the shadows for 10 years? Why did he only come out when his identity was revealed by others? </p>
<p>Yes, revealed by others. </p>

<p>Here are Thompson’s own words on that subject, from his August 27th public statement: </p>
<p>“…nor was I given any choice regarding whether my name would be made public or my voice would be put on the Internet.” </p>
<p>Thompson is admitting he was outed. This is very much like saying, “I would have stayed anonymous forever, if I hadn’t been dragged into the light.” </p>
<p>Now, look at yet another remark Thompson made in his public confession, and decide whether this is sheer PR, written to assuage his employers at the CDC and protect himself from blowback and harm: “I would never suggest that any parent avoid vaccinating children of any race.” </p>
<p>Really, Bill? Let me get this straight. You buried data which showed a 340% increased risk of autism, in African-American male babies, after they received the MMR vaccine—but African-American parents should continue to submit their babies to the MMR vaccine. Right? </p>
<p>Because of Thompson’s claim that he and the CDC are on the same page, others have concluded that Thompson is in no danger. “The professionals are working out the scientific problems and all is well.” </p>
<p>How naïve. How incredibly naïve. </p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/vaccinetruth.html" rel="nofollow" style="float: right;margin-left: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-MkKSFqq5-DE/TfAbRwTtoXI/AAAAAAAAJRE/itK2KofpgVU/VACCINE-BANNER.gif" alt=""></a>The CDC is a PR agency for the pharmaceutical cartel. That is its real function. You can bet CDC executives are keeping their pharmaceutical betters in the loop on “The Thompson Affair.” </p>
<p>Hundreds of billions of vaccine dollars are at stake. </p>
<p>Thompson knows, by going public, he has done something no researcher is supposed to do. He’s cast grave suspicion on his co-authors and on the CDC, to whom he’s taken an oath of silence. He’s broken that oath. </p>
<p>Violating omerta carries consequences. </p>
<p>William Thompson is claiming he won’t talk to reporters. That was also part of his August 27th statement. We’ll see if he holds to this promise. He and his lawyer may discover talking to reporters is his only option. For the sake of protection. </p>
<p>If Thompson comes out, he’d better insist on a live, uncensored, uncut video interview—done simultaneously in front of several different crews, uploaded in real time to dozens of sites, whereupon it can travel around the world in a matter of seconds. </p>
<p>And his security had better be excellent. </p>
<p>If he plans to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth. </p>

</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
My name is Anne Marie van Blijenburgh. I have been hitched for a long time with Kees van Korlaar. Together with his 3 siblings, Kees van Korlaar runs a criminal association called Octopus Syndicate (ed. This is a slang term in Holland for the cutting edge Italian Ndrangheta mafia). They are from 1960 to the present day still dynamic. Authorized by Queen Beatrix, kids were selected for torment, assault, and murder of youngsters in an open situation. These kids were controlled by means of youth confinement offices (youth penitentiaries) in the Netherlands. The lawbreakers moved toward the adolescent detainment facilities with the story that the Royal Court requested kids who could come to the Queen in a benefit for a specific timeframe. The confinement focuses were content with this demand and felt that the Queen was an extremely social lady. They gave with no uncertainty the individual documents of specific youngsters to the offenders. As youth detainment focuses needed to check this data whether it is genuine what the hoodlums let them know, they gave a name and telephone number of a high authority in the Court of Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands. This senior authority affirmed that there were undoubtedly youngsters scanned for a specific time to come and work in the Palace.</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
Each time, the crooks chose three youngsters from the recovered documents, a tyke that was vagrant and along these lines had no family. They at that point told the young detainment facilities this was the youngster they needed. Youth detainment offices gave the kid new garments, so the youngster looked fashionable amid the prospective employee meeting and after that were put on a prepare to Zwolle. In Zwolle, the tyke was driven by the crooks to a building that truly resembled a lodging, yet really was not completely open as an inn, in spite of the fact that there were individuals in the entryway and it appeared as though it was an inn. The tyke was put on a table and got offered a remark containing a narcotic. Notwithstanding this inn was where the scene occurred. In this building were individuals as onlookers and at one point the youngster was gotten by the hoodlums. The youngster was tormented, assaulted and killed on a brutal path before the eyes of the onlookers. In the middle was Prince Johan Friso (second child of Queen Beatrix). I was informed that Johan Friso was rationally irritated and had an unfortunate enthusiasm for youthful youngsters and that he had a therapist each day of his life. The name of this therapist is Guus Pareau Dumont. The culprits sorted out the murder endless supply of Queen Beatrix, she paid for the killings. The offenders inquired as to whether he needed to take his relatives and companions moreover. Space was so brimming with high-positioning Dutch: Ministers, senior authorities and a wide range of individuals they could put them on the photo there later to extort and as criminal favorable position.</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
Question: would you be able to name names of individuals who were available?</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
The general populations I perceived were Prince Johan Friso and his specialist Guus Pareau Dumont, Johan Friso&#8217;s better half Mabel Wisse Smit, she was there with an old man and I think it was George Soros. I perceived previous Minister of Justice, Mr. Donner (as of now emissary of Netherlands). I perceived Ernst Hirsch Ballin, a vital previous Minister of Justice. I perceived Mr. Van sanctum Emster, he was for a long time President of the Council for the legal in the Netherlands. I perceived Thick Berlin, the previous leader of the Ministry of the guard. I perceived an extremely surely understood columnist, Gerlof Lake by the week by week magazine Elsevier. I perceived Carla Eccles, the spouse of the therapist of Johan Friso, Carla is the President of the Amsterdam District Court, she is correct. I perceived Mark Rutte, he is as of now the Prime Minister of the Netherlands. I remembered he is Geert Wilders, the pioneer of the PVV, a political gathering in the Dutch Parliament. There were around fifty individuals each time I was brought there. I&#8217;ve been to it three times. Each time I was there I have seen that there was a youngster killed, I saw that two young men and a young lady have been killed. I assume this was Dutch youngsters, I assume they originated from confinement focuses and were touted in the way I have portrayed this as of now.</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
Question: you told that the administration of the confinement focuses thought the kids were eaten?</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
I asked a writer from The Telegraph in 2005 or 2006 to research and distribute this to me in the paper. The columnist disclosed to me that he had checked my story at youth confinement focuses on the Netherlands and had addressed individuals who for sure to the offenders who had given records. They suspected that the kids they had put on the prepare were requested that on prospective employee meet-up come to deal with the Court of Queen Beatrix. Some of those reviewed told the columnist that they thought Beatrix ate the kids since they put the kids on the prepare to Zwolle and have never again heard a word nor indication of these youngsters.</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
Question: do you know the end result for the remaining parts of the kids who kicked the bucket, where they were covered, what was the deal?</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
Indeed sadly I know this. They were behind the building where they were killed in a holder, a cooling compartment. After some &#8216; introductions &#8216; the holder was transported to Belgium where they claim a land parcel and that the kids were covered in a gap.</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
Question: what is the name of this place in Belgium?</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
I need to find it, I had it, however, I need to find it.</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
Question: what do you need with this?</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
I need those offenders are bolted up until the end of time.</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
Question: you said that you have gotten no assistance in the Netherlands?</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
No help in any way. From 2004 up to this point, I have talked with each cop who I ran over, with each court officer. I have examined this with Interpol. I even went to the Court to present a defense out of it and begin an examination. The Court said this isn&#8217;t my concern, however an issue of society and did not have any desire to issue a request to investigate. I have extremely done everything to make this open, yet I figure on the grounds that Beatrix and the Dutch Justice is included, nothing is finished with it. Each time somebody needs to backpedal on doing research, this gets undermined in light of the fact that Beatrix does not need any exploration done to it.</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
Question: would you affirm in another court an announcement in a Court of law under the customary law?</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
Indeed, I have nothing against it. I am so extremely furious, in the event that you would have seen what I have seen, this will be a piece of me whatever remains of my life. I can&#8217;t turn away, in light of the fact that it is the most offensive and cruelest thing what I have ever observed. Awful, awful, it&#8217;s simply appalling. It&#8217;s crazy. On one event my better half had me medicated and conveyed to that place, to indicate me once to perceive what was going on, it was around a 100 km drive from our House. Amid the ride back home I returned step by step and understood that I had recently perceived how a kid was killed. I burst into tears. My better half who was driving, hit his arm ameliorating around me and stated, &#8220;don&#8217;t make a big deal about these lower class youngsters, they are vagrants, it&#8217;s filth, it doesn&#8217;t make a difference that they have been murdered.&#8221; It is horrendous, I can not depict. Unfortunately that individuals have been watching this and have done nothing to stop it.</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
Question: and your life partner still lives?</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
He is as yet alive despite everything he confers murders. When you consider what number of individuals have been slaughtered since 2004. It is currently ten years and they execute in the vicinity of 10 and at least 20 individuals every year, it&#8217;s unpleasant. I have demonstrated the police in Netherlands four spots they use as burial grounds. Never, ever, has a cop at any point tried to go look.</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
Question: do you know the name of those four spots?</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
Truly, I can give those names, I can demonstrate them, I&#8217;ll email them to you. The culprits realize that I have instructed it to the police, they have each chance to influence the bodies to vanish. I know two spots where it is troublesome for them to influence them to vanish, which is in a profound puddle. In any case, typically when a body is found in a house in the Netherlands with blood, the police looks at with 20 or 30 men. Be that as it may, on the off chance that I tell the police I know four places in the Netherlands, what they use as a graveyard, and that on every burial ground perhaps 20 or 50, possibly 100 bodies are covered, there is nobody who will look, nobody who goes to those spots.</div>

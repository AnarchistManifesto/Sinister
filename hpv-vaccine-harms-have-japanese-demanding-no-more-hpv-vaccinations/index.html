<b><a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2014/03/hpv-vaccine-harms-have-japanese.html">Activist Post</a></b></p>
<p>Categorically, there’s a demonstrable difference regarding HPV vaccine damage from HPV vaccines {Gardasil® (Merck &amp; Co.) and Cervarix® (GlaxoSmithKline) [1]} in the Japanese population as compared with comparable damages in the USA, especially at government and scientific levels.  The evidence to support that remark is confirmed by an  international symposium and public forum that took place in Tokyo (February 25-26, 2014) under the auspices of The Researchers’ Organization Sounding a Warning concerning the Adverse Reactions induced by Human Papillomavirus Vaccines.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><b>The Researchers’ Organization Sounding a Warning concerning the Adverse Reactions induced by Human Papillomavirus Vaccines</b>, is led by Dr. Harumi Sakai, a former professor of Tokai University, School of Medicine and a former leader at the immunochemical research team at Texas University, Galveston, who made a presentation as did:  Sin Hang Lee, MD, former Associate Professor at Yale University and currently  pathologist of Milford Hospital; Dr. Francois Jerome Authier, MD, a professor at Universite Paris XII and a doctor at Systeme Hospital Henri Mondor de Paris; research fellow Lucija Tomljenovic, a PhD from the University of British Columbia [2] and Dr. Mirna Hajjar, MD, Department of Neurology, Hartford Hospital, Hartford, Connecticut, who presented her experience treating a young girl who experienced bilateral vision loss and left hemiparesis after HPV vaccination. [3] </p>
<p>The remarkable and most thrilling aspect of that symposium – besides the scientific presentations made – was the fact that “The public hearing was attended by eight medical academic members of the Japanese government’s Advisory Council on the Alleged Adverse Reactions to HPV Vaccines, several top-ranking Health Ministry bureaucrats, medical doctors and journalists from the nation’s major newspapers and television networks.”  [4]   Applause, applause, applause to those who were able to pull off such an event, to the esteemed presenters, and to those in public office who had the courage to attend.  That type of conference or symposium is needed to be held in the USA and has been proposed, but could not get off the ground.  I wonder why.</p>

<p>
The good folks at <a href="http://sanevax.org/">SaneVax, Inc.</a> were instrumental in helping to organize the event, so I asked Norma Erickson, their president, several questions about it.  She responded in great detail, so I decided to let her tell the story as answers to my questions.</p>
<p><b><i>How did the conference come about?</i></b></p>
<p>That question is not as simple as it seems. There were many events leading up to the organization of the Symposium. Perhaps it would be best to give you a little background information.</p>
<p>On March 28, 2013, the Japanese Health Ministry decided to add three vaccines (HPV, Hib and PCV7) to the mandatory ones. The number of serious adverse effects reported after HPV vaccine use was 52 times greater after Cervarix® than reports after flu vaccinations; 26 times higher after Gardasil® than after flu vaccinations.  </p>
<p>Consequently, on June 14, 2103, the Japanese Health Ministry told local governments to suspend recommending that girls aged 12 to 16 be given injections of the vaccines Cervarix® or Gardasil®, citing a possible link between chronic adverse reactions and the vaccines. </p>
<p>In August 2013, the SaneVax team was contacted by an HPV vaccine victim’s and parent’s group in Japan looking for information on HPV vaccine side effects. They were looking to petition their government officials to halt HPV vaccinations and wanted any scientific data that provided information to support their campaign.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/vaccinetruth.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" height="175" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-38G3VOJQToQ/TfAZ2bc-qRI/AAAAAAAAJQ8/LA-TGAvVeWk/250x250-b.jpg" width="200"></a>Early in September 2013 the Secretary General of the Nationwide Liaison Association of Cervical Cancer Vaccine Victims and Parents in Japan, and Mr. (Francis) Mutsuo Fukushima, journalist with Kyodo News, informed the SaneVax team that there were rumors of a delegation from the Japanese Ministry of Health planning to visit London in October to have discussions on the HPV vaccines with officials in the UK Department of Health and the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).  It was thought that this delegation may be willing to speak with scientific and medical experts who were independent of pharmaceutical industry ties.  </p>
<p>Following many discussions, SaneVax obtained confirmation from Mr. Tetsuya Miyamoto, Director of the Office of Vaccination Policy at the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare’s Health Policy Bureau and a qualified medical doctor in his own right, that he was leading a team embarking on a fact finding mission regarding HPV vaccines.  </p>
<p>Dr. Miyamoto’s team would include first class medical doctors from two of the six university hospitals in Japan, which had been entrusted with official research efforts to shed light on potential cause-and-effect relationships between HPV vaccines and adverse effects being experienced by young girls in Japan. He indicated that he and his team would be willing to meet with independent scientists and medical professionals who could assist them in this investigation. </p>
<p>Those attending the fact finding meeting in London on behalf of SaneVax were:  Dr. Sin Hang Lee, MD, Pathologist, Milford Hospital, Director, Milford Medical Laboratory Inc., and former associate professor of pathology at Yale University; Professor Francois Jerome Authier, MD, PhD, Reference Center for Neuromuscular Disorders, Henri Mondor Hospital, Paris and Dr. Damien Downing, MB BS, MIBiol from London who is a pioneer of Ecological Medicine, Mrs. Freda Birrell, Secretary of SaneVax Inc. and her husband David Birrell, VAERS Research Analyst for SaneVax Inc.  </p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>We didn’t realize it at the time, but this meeting in combination with an official statement from the Japanese Health Department issued on January 20, attempting to say the vast majority of the adverse events reported as being psychosomatic were the catalysts behind the organization of the International Symposium on the Adverse Reactions Experienced by those Vaccinated with Human Papillomavirus Vaccines and subsequent events. </p>
<p><b><i>So, who were the organizers of the symposium?</i></b></p>
<p>This symposium was organized on behalf of The Researchers’ Organization Sounding a Warning concerning the Adverse Reactions induced by Human Papillomavirus Vaccines, through the collaborative efforts of Dr. Harumi Sakai, former Professor at the Tokai University School of Medicine, Dr. Shohei Matsuzaki, Professor Emeritus at the Tokai University School of Medicine, Mutsuo Fukushima, Kyoto News International Department, and SaneVax Inc. The SaneVax team was primarily responsible for identifying and coordinating the presence of the International experts. Those in Japan handled everything else. There were countless individuals who contributed their time, talent and hard work to help make the symposium a success.</p>
<p><b><i>Can you give an estimation of Japanese grassroots opinion and involvement regarding HPV vaccine adverse events and problems?  Furthermore, do you think there is more organized grassroots interest in Japan than in the USA?</i></b></p>
<p>That is a difficult question to answer. There is intense interest in the HPV vaccine controversy in many countries around the world, as well as very strong grassroots involvement.  But, each country has its own peculiarities which have to be taken into account. The primary differences I see between the movement in Japan and those in other countries is <b>in Japan there were medical professionals who were strong enough to investigate the problems with HPV vaccines on their own and voice their opinion; and the Japanese people were successful at pressuring those in political power to actually hear both sides of the debate.</b>  [CJF emphasis added]</p>
<p><i><b>After having read the symposium reports and having interacted with those who participated in Japan, what are your thoughts about any political-scientific accomplishments regarding HPV vaccines and their adverse events?  Can you please list them?</b></i></p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/vaccineexempt.html" rel="nofollow" style="float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-WfI77BHRfFg/TpHdZMZJHeI/AAAAAAAALS4/KDabWFqA1jM/s200/AVGLE2.0-CD.jpg"></a>I can’t necessarily speak to the political accomplishments because Japan has not made a final decision about how they are going to respond to HPV vaccine concerns. Whatever final decision they make, I believe three very important things came out of the recent events in Japan.</p>
<p><b>1.</b> Advocates for those who experienced adverse events after HPV vaccination did not surrender. In spite of their pain, they organized, spoke out and demanded action from their government health officials and political representatives. </p>
<p><b>2. </b>Despite the intense pressure exerted on medical professionals to claim adverse events that occur after HPV vaccinations are the result of coincidence, mass hysteria, conversion disorder, psychogenic illness, fabricated illness, or genetic disorders, several medical professionals in Japan actually listened to their patients, investigated, and came to their own independent conclusions. Not only that, they had the courage to speak out for those who were suffering and demand investigations. <b><i>[Sadly, that is lacking in the USA and other countries!]</i></b></p>
<p><b>3.</b> Japanese politicians had the integrity to listen to both sides of the HPV vaccine debate in public as well as privately.  </p>
<p><b>In my opinion, every country in the world needs to take these three lessons to heart. If the citizens, medical professionals and politicians in every country did these three simple things, countless innocents would be spared years of needless suffering. </b>[CJF emphasis added]</p>
<p><b><i>Has there been any interest from the international community not represented at the symposium in either the symposium or its agenda?</i></b></p>
<p>The SaneVax team has literally been overwhelmed by emails from all over the world wanting more information about the events in Japan. The international community is intensely interested in the evidence presented regarding biologically plausible mechanisms of action between HPV vaccines and serious adverse events as well as wondering what Japan’s final decision will be regarding future HPV vaccination programs and policies. </p>
<p><b><i>Apparently, Australia is gung-ho to give HPV to both boys and girls.  Has there been any interest expressed by Australian vaccine safety activists regarding the Japanese symposium?</i></b></p>
<p>Yes, there has been interest from several in Australia, many victims of adverse reactions after HPV vaccines; but also several medical professionals and researchers.   <b><i>That’s encouraging to hear that Australian medical professionals and researchers are interested.</i></b><br />
<b><i><br />
</i></b> <b><i>Now, I’d like to hear about some of the scientific presentations that took place, if you will, please.  Dr. Lee’s presentation and pdf charts are most impressive. I’ve seen the results before. What comment would you like to make about Lee’s work and presentation in Japan?</i></b></p>
<p>* Dr. Sin Hang Lee – HPV L-1 Gene DNA in Gardasil and Its Potential Effects</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mhlw.go.jp/file/05-Shingikai-10901000-Kenkoukyoku-Soumuka/0000038472.pdf">http://www.mhlw.go.jp/file/05-Shingikai-10901000-Kenkoukyoku-Soumuka/0000038472.pdf</a></p>
<p>I agree.  Dr. Lee’s presentation was impressive. However, there were two points he got on the public record which were even more impressive. </p>
<p>First, during the public press conference, he asked if any scientist or medical professional there believed that sudden death, or brain and neurological damage exhibited in many of the slides presented could be the result of psychosomatic disorders. When no one raised their hands, Dr. Lee stated that fact so that it was recorded in the official transcript. </p>
<p>Second, when asked about the viral DNA issue, Dr. Lee made it crystal clear that the human body does not care whether the HPV DNA residue in Gardasil® is a complete strand, partial strand or simply a protein fragment – the human body reacts the same way to the invader – it is still viral DNA – with potentially dangerous consequences. </p>
<p>Both of these points have been ignored by the manufacturers, health authorities and government officials around the globe. </p>
<p><b><i>Dr. Authier’s presentation and charts really nail it down as to why certain symptoms (MMF) occur after HPV vaccinations, I think.  Do you agree?</i></b></p>
<p>* Dr. Jerome Authier – Biopersistance and Neuro migration of Particles after Intramuscular Injection – Impact of long-term safety of aluminum adjuvants</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mhlw.go.jp/file/05-Shingikai-10901000-Kenkoukyoku-Soumuka/0000038475.pdf">http://www.mhlw.go.jp/file/05-Shingikai-10901000-Kenkoukyoku-Soumuka/0000038475.pdf</a></p>

This in and of itself could explain why some suffer such debilitating effects while others have no apparent reaction. Since injected aluminum tends to stay in the body for long periods of time, the potential adverse effects may not show up for months, or years down the road. This is most definitely another avenue which demands investigation. </p>
<p><b><i>Dr. Hajjar’s presentation probably stunned everyone in attendance.  What do you have to say about that?</i></b></p>
<p>* Dr. Mirna Hajjar – A 16-Year-Old Girl With Bilateral Visual Loss and Left Hemiparesis Following an Immunization Against Human Papilloma Virus – case report</p>
<p><a href="http://jcn.sagepub.com/content/25/3/321.abstract">http://jcn.sagepub.com/content/25/3/321.abstract</a></p>
<p>Dr. Hajjar’s presentation, like all the above, demonstrates the frightening possibilities of life-altering events after getting a vaccine that is totally unnecessary since there are more effective and safer ways of preventing HPV diseases.  </p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p><b><i>What would you like to say about that case because other than death, blindness represents a horrific life-long adverse event, in my opinion?</i></b></p>
<p>The case Dr. Hajjar presented is indeed tragic. I cannot even begin to imagine the impact of permanently losing my sight at such a young age. Unfortunately, this is not the only life-long tragedy families are experiencing. Being confined to a wheelchair, losing your mental capacities, infertility, needing life-support systems to stay alive, incapacitating pain, rheumatoid arthritis – the list goes on and on. There is no excuse for ignoring these people.</p>
<p><b><i>Dr. Lucija Tomljenovic, PhD, made a presentation titled “Three Deaths Following Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Vaccination: Coincidence?”</i></b></p>
<p><a href="http://www.naturpedia.info/vaccini/cancro_utero_vaccino=morte.pdf">http://www.naturpedia.info/vaccini/cancro_utero_vaccino=morte.pdf</a></p>
<p><b><i>The frightening aspect of Dr. Tomljenovic’s presentation aside from the two deaths is the post mortem finds that the antigens in the HPV vaccines were found in brain sections: </i></b></p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>
“Post-mortem brain tissue specimens from two young women who suffered from            cerebral vasculitis-type symptoms following vaccination with the HPV vaccine Gardasil     were analysed by IHC for various immuno-inflammatory markers. Brain sections were         also stained for antibodies recognizing HPV-16L1 and HPV-18L1 antigen which are         present in Gardasil.” </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>
“Conclusions: Our study suggests that HPV vaccines containing HPV-16L1 antigens    pose an inherent risk for triggering potentially fatal autoimmune vasculopathies.” [5]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><i>What comments would you like to make since the Tomljenovic-Shaw paper obviously represents the findings upon post mortem brain tissue, which means the young girls’ deaths apparently were impacted by the HPV vaccine, Gardasil®?</i></b></p>

<p>I would say the time has come for people to understand the absence of evidence is not the same thing as evidence of absence.  Every single new medical condition occurring after vaccination should be investigated as a possible vaccine reaction—particularly deaths.  No answers will be found unless we start looking for them.</p>
<p><b><i>Would you like to comment on how any or all adverse symptoms compare regarding Cervarix® and Gardasil® post-vaccination.</i></b></p>
<p>Both HPV vaccines tend to do one of two things in those who are unlucky enough to experience severe reactions. Either they ‘wake up’ any virus the person has been previously exposed to; or they tend to make the person’s immune system attack their own body resulting in what is called an auto-immune disorder.  <b><i>Unfortunately, vaccine science does not want to recognize nor acknowledge that.  That truly is an issue that medical science must address—and soon!</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>Has anyone made a comparison between both HPV vaccines adverse events since Cervarix® targets HPV types 16 and 18 and Gardasil® targets four HPV types (6, 11, 16, and 18)?</i></b></p>
<p>It is most difficult to compare the rates of adverse events between the two vaccines, primarily because most countries only use one of them at a time. Almost all countries have voluntary reporting of suspected adverse events. Couple that with the fact that most countries do not keep track of administered doses – only distributed doses. These two facts tend to skew the results of any attempted analysis of adverse event rates.</p>
<p>The closest I have personally seen to a comparison of the two came out of Japan. Cervarix® had 52 times more adverse event reports than influenza vaccines and Gardasil® had 26 times more adverse events reported than influenza vaccines. </p>
<p><b><i>What would you like to say as your closing remarks?</i></b></p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/vaccinetruth.html" rel="nofollow" style="float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-MkKSFqq5-DE/TfAbRwTtoXI/AAAAAAAAJRE/itK2KofpgVU/VACCINE-BANNER.gif"></a>The time has come for scientists to determine who is most likely to suffer an adverse reaction after vaccination and why. Physicians need to establish diagnostic criteria for vaccine injuries. Most importantly, successful treatment protocols must be developed for vaccine injuries.</p>
<p><b><i>I couldn’t agree more with you regarding that statement.  However, those damaged by HPV vaccines are left to fend for themselves with no repercussions for vaccine makers who have no liability at all!</i></b></p>
<p>As a society, we can no longer justify sacrificing our children’s health and perhaps their very lives in the name of public health. The ‘greater good’ is no excuse – every single individual life is valuable – we need to start acting like it.</p>
<p><b><i>Let me add that I second that over and over again.</i></b><br />

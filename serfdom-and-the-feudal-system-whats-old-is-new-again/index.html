<a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2013/01/serfdom-and-feudal-system-whats-old-is.html"><b>Activist Post</b></a></p>
<p>The period of history from the 5th to the 15th century was known  as the Middle Ages.  During this time, the law of the land in Europe was  known as the “feudal system.”  This was the manner in which the upper  10% (the nobility) controlled the lower 90% (the serfs or peasants).</p>
<p>There were a few kings who were very wealthy and powerful, who  owned all of the land.  To maintain control of this land, it was broken  into fiefdoms and pieces were given to friends of the kings (barons).   The barons then allotted land to their friends and allies in order to  govern efficiently.  It was in this manner that the “nobility” was  created, and the land passed down through these select few families by  manner of inheritances.</p>
<p>The reward of  being delegated this control came at a price.  To  maintain the control of the fiefdoms, manors and estates, the nobility  had to pledge fealty to the kings and pay them taxes and homage.</p>
<p>It is estimated that just over 90% of the population of Europe  were peasants.  Most peasants were basically slaves.  They were provided  with a small shelter on an inferior piece of land and the “protection”  of the noble in charge of that area. In return, they worked for the  estate, farming the land with no recompense, paying taxes and having no  control over their own lives.  Some peasants were “free” and had their  own small businesses: blacksmiths, carpenters, bakers, etc.  They paid  for the protection of the “lord” with money, goods and services.</p>
<p>Peasants had few rights.  They could be taxed at any time, were  obligated to use (and pay for) services of the manor like mills or large  ovens, and had to request permission for marriages, change of locations  or educating their children.</p>
<p>Each year, the peasant was required to give the best part of his  harvest to the lord of the manor. The peasants were not allowed to own  things that made their lives easier, like oxen or horses, for example. A  peasant did not own the land on which he lived and was therefore  obligated to live where he was told, grow what he was told, and farm in  the manner in which he was told. They were not allowed to hunt on the  lord’s land – poaching was an offense punishable by death.  They were  not allowed to cut trees for firewood, but forced to gather fallen  branches in order to stay warm.  A peasant was not allowed to have real,  effective weapons – those were reserved for the armies of the nobility,  in order to keep the peasants in line and immediately quell any quest  for dignity and independence.</p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>Most of the peasants seemed content with the arrangement because  they received security and safety from the lord.  He was obligated to  protect them from marauders and barbarians, and provide enough land for  subsistence. Serfs could be used as a commodity, and traded.  If the  control of the land changed hands, the serfs were included in the  transaction. </p>
<p><b>Is it really a leap to say that we are still living on the feudal system?</b></p>
<p><a name="more"></a>Members of the global elite still meet and choose the leaders of the  world, based on which of those leaders will “swear fealty” by agreeing  to the agenda set forth by said elite.  <a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/bilderberg-101-05312012" target="_blank">The Bilderberg group</a>,  with their influence on world policy and finance, are the king-makers –  future leaders are vetted by them, then their campaigns are fully  funded.  In this way, control trickles down but it is just one small  group of people who actually call the shots.</p>

<p>
On a more local  level, think about the home you “own.”  The  properties that we think we own are taxed on an annual basis in most  places.  As the economic debt goes higher and higher every year, so do  our property taxes.   As we improve our properties, our taxes increase.   If you think you really own your home or land, try skipping your tax  payment and you’ll see how quickly the true owners appear. We are  merely tenants.</p>
<p>Our income taxes go up every time the <strike>barons</strike> government,  needs more money.  This leaves us with less money for us to feed our  families.  Income tax is not optional – it comes off your paycheck  before you see a dime of it.  You are paying for the privilege of  working.</p>
<p>We must be granted permission and pay even more taxes for  the privilege of going about our every day lives.  We must purchase a  license to  drive on the roads, build on our properties, or hunt and  fish to feed our families.  Even with a license, hunting is only allowed  at certain times per year – self-sufficiently feeding your family with  game outside the specific 2 week windows throughout the year is illegal.   If we farm, we are obligated to comply with overbearing regulations in  order to sell our home-raised food to others. If we choose to farm  without chemicals and toxins, we aren’t allowed to advertise the fact  without filling out <a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/certified-organic-the-conspiracy-against-natural-foods-12052012" target="_blank">crippling reams of paperwork</a>.  We must bow to the <a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/the-sinister-corporate-agenda-of-the-fda-04142012" target="_blank">FDA</a> and destroy some of the nutrients in our food (pasteurization) if we want to sell it to others.</p>
<p>Speaking of monopolies,<a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/monsanto-the-real-cyberdyne-04222012" target="_blank"> Monsanto</a>,  aided and abetted by friends at the FDA, is attempting to take over the  farming industry. If a farmer refuses to use the frankenseeds, and a  bit of pollen drifts over from a nearby farm who has sold out to Big  Agri, the independent farmer can be taken to court and sued into  oblivion, losing his property and his livelihood.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/homeschoolguide.html" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 0em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" class="noshadow" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/_qLAIskTQXUc/TW61gkmHYeI/AAAAAAAAHPQ/fMnfpZ7Y9So/book1.png" style="border: none;background:none"></a>If we choose to educate our children at home and raise independent  thinkers, we must also be subject to “oversight”.  Most states have a  governing board which tests home-schooled children on an annual basis.   Parents are told what their children must learn and the timeline on  which they must learn it.</p>
<p>Parents are still taxed to subsidize the  schools that their children do not attend and must pay out of pocket for  the approved educational material they must use to teach the children.  The government frowns upon children being independently educated, as  this does not create the obedient serfs that the public schools system  is designed to churn out.</p>
<p>In return for all of the permissions we must purchase annually, we  are all under the “protective” wing of our respective governments.  </p>
<p>These feudal lords dole out food via welfare programs, healthcare and  medication via government standards, and <strike>brainwashing</strike> education for the children.  In the US, for example, the Rubicon has  been crossed in that more people receive “benefits” from a government  program than do not. The system is not designed to help people get back  on their feet – it has been created to establish a system of dependency.</p>
<p>People are forcibly injected with toxic vaccines and doled out  psychiatric medications.  Whereas once education was not legal, now  people are being purposely dumbed down and chemically subdued in order  to quell any thought of rebellion.  A government-induced apathy keeps  the masses tame and docile.</p>
<p>Weapons have already been restricted in many countries and are being  targeted by the US government right now.  Only the knights – er, the  military and the police – should have weapons, in order to quell any  potential rebellion by the peasants – us.  The US government has  famously made enormous purchases of weapons and ammunition over the past  year, while working diligently to remove weapons from the hands of the  people.</p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>The original feudal system began to decline with the Peasant’s  Revolt in 1381.  After the Black Death reduced the population by over  one-third, there were not enough peasants to get in the harvests.  The  serfs seized the opportunity, refusing to work, refusing to pay rent and  running away from the estates on which they lived.  The lords were  forced to negotiate with better terms for the peasants in order to get  them to work.  The monarchy, however, was not pleased with this and  began to levy even more taxes on the peasants (austerity measures?)  The  peasants ended up revolting violently, storming the tower of London,  executing financiers and noblemen, and burning down castles. </p>
<p>The nobles quickly mobilized a militia and squelched the revolt.   The leaders of the uprising were publicly executed.  Although the  revolt was not seen as a success, it was the beginning of the end for  the medieval feudal system, as the nobles realized that the peasants had  the power of numbers behind them and that they could wreak havoc by  simply refusing to work.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/organicfood.html" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em" target="_blank"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/_qLAIskTQXUc/TW_lAOEOZEI/AAAAAAAAHRE/fDi5YhxdsQs/groworganic.jpg" alt=""></a>What lessons can we take from this?</p>
<p>As there has always been, <a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/new-world-order-101-02262012" target="_blank">there are those who want a one-world government,</a> divided into small controllable segments, ruled over by those who will support the power agenda, swearing loyalty to the elite.</p>
<p>These elite use the following tactics to manipulate the masses:  government sponsored <a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/defining-a-false-flag-event-01312012" target="_blank">false flag events</a>,  incrementalism, dumbing down the population, programming opinions  through media and popular culture, and entertainment distractions (bread  and circuses).</p>
<p>Only with unified effort will the people  to live in dignity and  equality.  If only 5% of the people refuse to serve the elite, there are  still billions more to take our places. It is vital to spread  awareness. Just as the mainstream media drills submission into  the subconscious of the masses, we must hammer away at  their perceived reality.</p>
<ul>
<li>Vote with your wallets – refuse to support the massive corporations  owned by the global elite.  Stop buying into their theories on the  latest items you “must” have.   Don’t shop at their slave-labor big box  stores, don’t eat their mass-produced food-like substances and don’t  take their deadly “medications”.  Put them out of business by refusing  to participate and make sure others know why you are doing it.</li>
<li>Strive for self-sufficiency.  Grow your food, purchase what you  cannot grow yourself from local farmers and learn to live with what you  can provide for yourself. Providing for yourself is your God-given  right, not a permission to be granted by the “elite”, the government or  the big corporations.</li>
<li>Be aware of the creeping presence of Agenda 21 – fight it every step  of the way by shedding light on the plan.  Contradict the warm fuzzy  language and enlighten people about the land grabs, the ownership of  nature and the corralling of humans into controlled areas.</li>
<li>Refuse to participate in benefits programs – this system is designed to encourage dependency, and through dependency, control.</li>
</ul>

The most important step of all is shining the light on the secret  plans of who consider the rest of us peasants, put here to serve them.   Don’t be discouraged if efforts to revolt against this control do not  immediately succeed.  It took a couple hundred years to make feudalism  illegal the first time around.</p>
<p>Resist.  Teach the next generation to do the same. Learn from the  past to create a different future – this is just a new spin on a theme  that is ages-old.</p>

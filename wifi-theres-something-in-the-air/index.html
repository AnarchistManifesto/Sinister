<p>Have you ever caught a cold from a friend or work colleague? Did you  see the germs go through the atmosphere and enter into your body and  then do you harm, causing you dis-ease? Did you sense the dis-ease when  it first started to manifest? I would imagine the answers to these  questions would be no, as personally, I haven’t; but, then again, even  though my name may suggest it, I am not a superhero. This is exactly  what WIFI is doing to all of us and we are not even aware of it.</p>
<p>In my  personal life, cancer cases are going off the charts, which is ringing  alarm bells on all fronts for me. Is Electromagnetic Radiation  anything to do with this rise in cancer rates, which will soon reach 1  in 2 people? The World Health Organization has just released a rather  bleak report saying cancer will rise by 70 % in the next 20 years. Let’s  take a look at some of the evidence that WIFI may be causing this.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>The BBC showed a Panorama documentary in May 2007 discussing the  effects of WIFI and how it came to be in the UK. The program concluded  that WIFI is similar to radiation from mobile phones. Sir William  Stewart was also interviewed who, at that time, was the Chairman of the  Health Protection Agency. He stated ‘You can choose whether to have  mobiles’. You have no choice with WIFI. He also said ‘There may be  changes in cognitive function. There were some indications that there  may be cancer inductions’.</p>
<p>Sir William Stewart was asked by Tony Blair  to look into the effects of radiation from mobile masts. He concluded  that there were molecular biology changes with the cell. The report  recommended masts should not be placed near schools. From this  recommendation back in 2007 we now have WIFI antennas inside the  classroom, which are mini masts. They give off three times more  radiation than when standing in direct line of the mast. What an  unbelievable turnaround of events, and a lack of Duty of Care to the  general public. Tony Blair has more questions to answer over this money-making scheme, along with his Iraq war debacle. The Health Protection  Agencies stance today states “There is no <b>consistent evidence</b> of  health effects from RF exposures below guideline levels and no reason  why schools and others should not use WIFI equipment”. This is a very  ambiguous statement to say the least!!!</p>

<p>
Dr Mike Repacholi, founder of  ICNIRP, who also worked with the World  Health Organization stated there were no known health effects on the  WHO website back in 2007. Prior to setting up ICNIRP, he worked for the  phone industry defending their right to place masts in controversial  locations. He was then re-employed by the phone industry after working  for WHO and ICNIRP also. This is the man who set the guidelines for our  exposure to this type of radiation. There seems to be a conflict of  interest here, as does appear in many cases of big business controlling  the political system for their own profit. And all this has been done in  plain sight.</p>
<p>ICNIRP, is an International group of scientists the government relies  on to set radiation limits but their studies do not recognise any  biological effects. It bases our exposure limits on a thermal effect.  The radiation has to be so strong that it heats up your organs before it  is restricted. That’s why our safety limits are so high. Switzerland,  Italy, Russia and China all have exposure limits thousands of times  below ours. In Saltsburg the government advised against WIFI altogether.</p>
<p>The French National Assembly has adopted a bill to limit exposure to  electromagnetic fields (EMFs) generated by wireless technologies – cell  phones, tablets, WIFI etc. This bill will mean the following:</p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<li>A ban on WIFI in all childcare facilities for children under the age of 3.</li>
<li>Cell phone manufacturers will have to recommend the use of hand-free kits.</li>
<li>A ban on all advertising targeting children under 14.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/stepoutsidethebox.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 0em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-kADbI3spO2M/TwILKt_It9I/AAAAAAAANvU/F0N-dw_gGR4/s261/cancer.png"></a>A recent International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) report  suggested that EMF exposures can be more devastating in children because  their brain tissue is more conductive, their skulls are thinner, they  have smaller brains with softer brain tissue allowing radiation to  penetrate more effectively. And, a potentially longer period of exposure  due to use beginning at an earlier age. This new French bill seems to  have taken these concerns into account.</p>
<p>Dr Ian Gibson, former Norwich North MP said in the BBC documentary  ‘The British government were not adhering to the guidelines they  commissioned. Industry ‘rules’ in this area and the precautionary  principle and the safety of people who may benefit to some extent, from  the technologies, are completely dismissed’.</p>
<p>Sir William Stewart also wants a new investigation. He stated ‘There  are people who are <i>electro sensitives</i> and feel the effects. They are  the human canaries of the future’. So yet again we have another example  of human guinea pigs. Do we really want our children to be the canaries  in the coal mine? If the technology has not been tested for the pulse  radiation that it emits, then how can this be deemed to be safe? Tony  Blair and his Billion pound contracts with the telecommunication  industries obviously wanted to ignore this fact.</p>
<p>Professor Henry Lai, Dr Gerd Oberfeld, and Dr Olle Johansson all  appeared on the Panorama documentary and spoke of the dangers of this  type of radiation. I am not promoting the BBC in any way, but here are  the links to the documentary.</p>

<p>Wireless communication devices are listed as a 2B carcinogen. The TUC<i> </i>document,<i> Occupational Cancer: A  Workplace Guide</i>[1], advises that establishments do not introduce class  2B Carcinogens.</p>
<p>Page 6 states that “Caution should be used to prevent  exposure to substances in Group 2B”.<br />
  <br />
The Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999[2], and  COSHH (Control of Substances Hazardous to Health) [3] means that the  first step must always be to remove the hazard altogether if possible.</p>

<p>Wireless radiation that children are being exposed to in the  classroom has caused so much concern amongst pediatricians in America,  60,000 of them have written to congress urging the removal of WIFI  technology from schools.</p>
<p>I have been in touch with Professor Olle Johansson who also says ‘<b>There is growing scientific evidence</b>  that children are likely to be more vulnerable to pulsed microwave  radiation than adults, and new research shows there may be other serious  effects on behaviour and learning ability. There is general agreement  among scientists that electromagnetic fields penetrate into the brain of  children more than in adults because children’s skulls are thinner.  There is also a broad consensus that children are more vulnerable to  adverse effects from radiation because their bodies are still  developing.</p>
<p>The World Health Organisation, in 2011, classified electromagnetic  fields from wireless information as possible carcinogens. The Council of  Europe’s Environment Committee in its Resolution no. 1815 from May 2011  calls for strong measures to protect the public against harmful effects  of radiation, including a ban on mobile phones and <b>wireless Internet in schools</b> with regard to children’s health’.</p>
<p>Here is the professor talking about the BioInitiative report with  over 2,000 references to the harmful effects of this radiation.</p>

<p>The BioInitiative 2012 Report has been prepared by 29 authors from  ten countries, ten holding medical degrees (MDs), 21 PhDs, and three  MsC, MA or MPHs. Among the authors are three former presidents of the  Bioelectromagnetics Society, and five full members of BEMS.</p>
<p>Also I have been in touch with Barrie Trower, who has written and  published the 2013 WIFI report.</p>
<p>This is entitled <i>WIFI – A Thalidomide in  the making</i>. Who cares? That is what I ask myself every day. It seems to  me that so many people are bamboozled by the ever-increasing intensity  of this meme we live in and are not looking at what is happening around  them. This is a very frustrating place for the people who have woken up  and are putting themselves out there to make a difference. <b>Now is your  chance to get involved and do something constructive.</b></p>
<p>You can download  a copy of the 2013 WIFI report from our website  together with a notice you can send to your head teacher to say that  they have now received this information and are responsible for the  detrimental effects of this technology under their Duty of Care to the  children. Allow the Headmaster to respond and see if you can get the  WIFI removed with just the information. If this doesn’t happen for you,  we need you to confirm the headmaster is not going to take the WIFI out  of the school, send us this information and any correspondence you have  with the school and we will take the matter further on a larger scale.</p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

Please collect all responses, both good and bad as we are going to  collate all evidence and will be seeking criminal negligence charges  from these people if they do not act.

<p>What our children are subjected to is really intolerable for us as a  species. After a baby has been conceived, it is bombarded by microwave  radiation in the womb because of the soup we live in today. When the  baby is born, the first kick start to the immune system is from the  bacteria from the vaginal tract, which is now compromised because of the  bad diet many mothers eat, like pre processed and fast food. Then up to  the age of two, while still developing the immune system, the baby can  be subjected to up to thirty vaccines, which can result in completely  destroying the immune system.</p>
<p>Then the use of bisphenol A in plastics,  aspartame in sweets and other dangerous additives will also be attacking  the immune system. Add GM food to the mix, together with the increase  in aluminum, strontium and other such toxins in our air , leads to a  complete health implosion of epic proportion.</p>

<p>The baby does pick up on the electromagnetic frequency of the mother  and fathers heart, where studies prove that a more emotionally balanced  child will develop when held close to the heart area frequently, as  opposed to ones that are not. This part of a child’s development is also  being compromised by the pulse radiation, that doesn’t appear in  nature, and will be disrupting the energy flow from parent to child.</p>
<p>My final note would be to draw your attention to Manly P Hall’s speech on the magnetic field we have around us as human beings.</p>
<p>[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qtn6D_Z_EuM?feature=player_embedded]</p>
<div align="center"></div>
<p>This has again been looked into in recent times, even though it is  ancient knowledge, and this pulse radiation from wireless technology  does not occur in nature. Therefore we are currently having to deal with  an ever growing soup of radiation, and we don’t understand the  consequences of our actions. Human history is distorted, contrived and  controlled to a certain extent, who knows what is the ultimate truth.  All I am sensing is this is the wrong path we are taking with untested  technology. It is about profit, not safety. Pink Floyd sung about  ‘Welcome to the Machine’. In this case with the EMF soup we live in, it  is ‘Welcome to the Coal Mine’. You are the canary this technology is  being tested upon!!!</p>
<p>Here is an interview on the People’s Voice featuring Professor Olle  Johansson and Peter Parker talking to Richie Allen about the problems  with WIFI, and what we can do about it.</p>

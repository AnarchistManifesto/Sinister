<p>As prospects for a preemptive strike on Iran remain ever present, the  recent round of talks between the P5+1 and Iran in Baghdad on May 23rd,  2012 have resulted in a familiar stalemate. As a precondition for any  deal to stop higher-grade uranium enrichment, Tehran requested immediate  relief from economic sanctions as a show of reciprocity [1]. Iranian  chief negotiator Saeed Jalili emphasized Tehran’s right to develop  peaceful nuclear energy as a signatory to the nuclear Non-Proliferation  Treaty, while the P5+1 refused to scale back economic sanctions,  insisting Iran suspend its 20% uranium enrichment program [2].</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>As  leaders in Tel Aviv assert that Israel may conduct military strikes  against Iran before the US Presidential elections in November [2], Major  General Hassan Firouzabadi of the Iranian Armed Forces reiterated  Iran’s commitment to the full annihilation of the Zionist regime and the  continual support of Palestinian autonomy [3]. Even if Tehran reaches  an agreement with the IAEA, Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak refused  to rule out a military strike against Iranian facilities, demanding that  Iran dismantle its uranium enrichment sites and use only imported fuel  [4]. </p>
<div align="center">
</div>
<p>
Although the recent conference in Baghdad failed to meet the  expectations of its participants, Iran and the five permanent members of  the UN Security Council plus Germany have agreed to hold another round  of talks in Moscow on June 18th [5]. As a further indication of division  between P5+1 participants, Germany has pledged to work toward a  political and diplomatic solution to Iran’s nuclear energy issues by  providing Tehran with technical assistance in developing a peaceful  nuclear program [6], while the US Senate recently approved a new round  of sanctions against Iran aimed at any country or company that provides  technology or resources to develop Tehran’s oil and uranium resources  [7].</p>
<p>The new legislation targets Iran’s national oil and tanker firms  and widens sanctions on Iran’s energy sector to any international joint  venture where Tehran is a substantial partner or investor. As the US  continually pressures Beijing to join its oil embargo, the Chinese  Foreign Ministry remains vocally opposed to the new package of economic  sanctions against Iran [8]. </p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/foodcrisis.html" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-AZzgc806w9s/TtEamGAkBbI/AAAAAAAAM2Y/GN5ff31ySP4/s200/imgad.jpg"></a>Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Alexander Lukashevich blasted the US  for imposing new unilateral sanctions against Iran, describing the move  as an irrational measure intended to the harm pace of negotiations [9].</p>
<p>India has remained adamant against expanding sanctions on Iran [10], as  New Delhi and Tehran agree to increase annual bilateral trade two thirds  to $25 billion by 2015, confirming their intent to bypass US sanctions  by making payments for a significant portion of its oil purchases from  Iran in rupees [11].</p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>As further cooperation between the US and the  Persian Gulf monarchies of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) remains  evident through their unanimous support of Syria’s armed opposition,  Saudi Arabia remains a major beneficiary under the continued imposition  of sanctions on Tehran from Washington. Japan and South Korea once  accounted for 26% of Iran’s oil exports [12], now both Seoul [13] and  Tokyo [14] have sought stable supplies of crude oil from Saudi Arabia.  As South Africa turns to Saudi Arabia after halting business with Iran  [15], the kingdom’s crude output is at a thirty-year high [16], as  shipments to the United States quietly rise to 25% [17]. </p>
<p>As a result of sanctions on Iran, Christine Lagarde of the International  Monetary Fund predicts that oil prices could spike as much as 30% and  hover around $160 per barrel if Iran’s crude oil exports fell sharply  [18].</p>
<p>As Iranian production hits a ten-year low as of March 2012,  industry-wide fears of a recession-fueled fall in demand have prompted  the reduction of total world oil production through the imposition of  embargoes on Iranian oil; higher prices triggered by a supply squeeze  from the sanctions work to further benefit international oil companies  and producers like Saudi Arabia [19].</p>
<p>In March 2012, the US granted  Japan and 10 EU nations a six-month reprieve to gradually cut their  imports of Iranian oil, lest they be subjected to their own financial  sanctions and cut off from the US financial system [20]. Under the 2012  US National Defense Authorization Act, Barack Obama can impose financial  sanctions on foreign banks that carry out financial transactions with  Iran’s central bank “for the purchase of petroleum or petroleum products  from Iran” [21]. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/USD-IRR-730-day-exchange-rate-history-graph-large1.png" style="clear: left;float: left;margin-bottom: 0em;margin-right: 1em"><img border="0" src="https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/USD-IRR-730-day-exchange-rate-history-graph-large.png" width="250"></a>Given  the fragile state of the European economy, the further implementation  of financial sanctions on nations who fail to comply with the oil  embargo on Iran is thoroughly unreasonable, with entirely negative  implications for the European Union. Any further escalation of tensions  with Iran would likely trigger inflated oil prices, which could further  cripple the unstable economies of Greece and Portugal and potentially  lead to those nations leaving the European Union. Despite Iranian Oil  Minister Rostam Qassemi downplaying the negative effects of sanctions  [22], inflation is soaring within Iran as the cost of food increases  between 25% to 125%, with 60% of the population relying on cash  subsidies handed out by Tehran [23].</p>
<p>Iran’s budget deficit for the  2011/2012 fiscal year is expected to be between $30 to $50 billion, as  the Iranian rial continues to plunge after the imposition of the oil  embargo, causing widespread panic buying of gold among the Iranian  public [24]. </p>
<p>As commodity prices in Iran continue to skyrocket, former Mossad  director Efraim Halevy remarked, “The rial is going down, it’s gone down  by over 50 percent. It’s almost impossible to describe the damage  done,” while former Israeli foreign minister Shlomo Ben-Ami forewarns,  “When a national currency loses 50% of its value in a matter of weeks,  economic collapse is at hand.” [25][26]. As Iran struggled to replace  it’s client base following the imposition of US-led economic sanctions,  Israeli Finance Minister Yuval Steinitz spoke before the Israeli cabinet  predicting the collapse of the Iranian economy [27]. Haaretz reports  the remarks of an unnamed senior official in the Israeli Foreign  Ministry, “These aren’t sanctions against Iran. Instead, they are  sanctions imposed by the West to curb Israel’s attack plans, had Israel  not spoken out about its intention to attack, none of this would be  happening. The Iranians are frightened. You have to understand what’s  going on there in stores; citizens grab food off the shelves because  they are worried about an impending attack. Inflation is soaring and the  currency has lost half its value. All this attests to fear.” [28] </p>
<p>As the black market in Iran expands amid an increasing lack of public  confidence in the rial, the role of the state is indirectly strengthened  because smuggling imports requires strong connections within the  regime, leaving the poor and lower middle class susceptible to poverty  while the officials being targeted by sanctions themselves benefit from  the embargo [29]. The fact that Obama administration chose to  preemptively impose sanctions on Iran before the P5+1 meeting in Baghdad  even took place indicates that the objective of US-Israeli policy  toward Iran seeks not mutual agreement and reconciliation, but the  further perpetuation of conflict to ensure that the question of Iran’s  nuclear energy issue remains unsolved. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei  Lavrov said the scope for sanctions over Iran’s nuclear program had been  exhausted and any additional measures were intended to provoke  discontent in the Iranian population [30]. </p>

<p>As the United States and its allies offer unflinching support to armed  opposition groups under cover of “democratic activism” in  non-acquiescent countries in the region, any popular revolution in Iran  would unquestionably be supported and used to pressure the government  from within, even using the opportunity to launch an armed opposition  insurrection. An articled published in The New Yorker by Seymour M.  Hersh entitled, “<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2012/04/mek.html">Our Men in Iran?</a>,”  documents how members of Mujahideen-e-Khalq (MEK), an Iranian dissident  group and US State Department-listed terrorist organization, were  trained in communications, cryptography, small-unit tactics and weaponry  by the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) at a base in Nevada  starting in 2005 [31]. JSOC instructed MEK operatives on how to  penetrate major Iranian communications systems, allowing the group to  intercept telephone calls and text messages inside Iran for the purpose  of sharing them with American intelligence. The group has been  implicated in the assassination of Iranian nuclear scientists [32] and  the planting of the Stuxnet malware that sabotaged Iran’s nuclear  facility in Natanz [33]. </p>
<p>MEK was founded in 1965 as a Marxist Islamic mass political movement  aimed at agitating the monarchy of the US-backed Iranian Shah, Mohammad  Reza Pahlavi. The group initially sided with revolutionary clerics led  by Ayatollah Khomeini following the 1979 Islamic Revolution, but  eventually turned away from the regime during a power struggle that  resulted in the group waging urban guerilla warfare against Iran’s  Revolutionary Guards in 1981. The organization was later given refuge by  Saddam Hussein and mounted attacks on Iran from within Iraqi territory,  killing an estimated 17,000 Iranian nationals in the process [34]. MEK  exists as the main component of the Paris-based National Council of  Resistance of Iran (NCRI), a “coalition of democratic Iranian  organizations, groups and personalities,” calling itself a  “parliament-in-exile” seeking to “establish a democratic, secular and  coalition government” in Iran [35]. Following the toppling of Saddam  Hussein, UN special representative in Iraq Martin Kobler organized  efforts to relocate MEK insurgents to a former US military base near the  Baghdad airport, with the full support of the US Embassy in Iraq and  the State Department to avoid violent clashes between the MEK and the  Shiite-led Iraqi government [36]. </p>
<p>MEK has long received material assistance from Israel, who assisted the  organization with broadcasting into Iran from their political base in  Paris, while the MEK and NCRI have reportedly provided the United States  with intelligence on Iran’s nuclear program. Despite the documented  cases of atrocities committed by MEK forces, elder statesmen such as  former NATO Supreme Allied Commander General Wesley K. Clark, former New  York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, former 9/11 Commission Chairman Lee  Hamilton were paid $20,000 to $30,000 per engagement to endorse the  removal of the Mujahideen-e Khalq from the US State Department’s list of  Foreign Terrorist Organizations [37]. NBC News reports that Israel  provided financing, training and arms to Mujahideen-e Khalq, who are  responsible for killing five Iranian nuclear scientists since 2007 using  motorcycle-borne assailants often attaching small magnetic bombs to the  exterior of the victims’ cars [38]. A recent investigation by the US  Treasury Department has indicated that Mujahedin-e Khalq Organization is  financially sponsored by the Israeli regime and Saudi Arabia [39].</p>
<p>Upon launching a war against Iran, aggressor nations would likely  utilize MEK forces as opposition insurgents and could even recognize the  touted “parliament-in-exile”, the National Council of Resistance of  Iran, as Iran’s legitimate representative, much like the how the Friends  of Syria group has recognized the opposition Syrian National Council  [40]. From her political base in Paris, exiled NCRI leader Maryam Rajavi  is a strong candidate for Western support in contrast to internal  opposition figures such as Mir-Hossein Mousavi, former Iranian Prime  Minister turned political reformist and figurehead of the Green Movement  demonstrations in 2009 following the victory of incumbent President  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in elections widely perceived as a fraudulent [41].  Although Mousavi has advocated greater personal freedoms in Iran and the  disbanding of religious police enforcers, he is a strong advocate of  Iran’s nuclear energy program and would likely never yield the kind of  acquiescence to Western policy that exiled figures such as Maryam Rajavi  would uphold in exchange for political support and material assistance  [42]. It is widely believed that Mousavi is currently held under house  arrest without an arrest warrant, charge or trial [43]. </p>

<p>On October  1, 2010, the IAEA proposed a deal according to which Iran would send  3.5% enriched uranium abroad and receive 20% enriched uranium from  potential suppliers in return, namely France and the United States, who  Tehran accused of stalling negotiations from the start [46].</p>
<p>Tehran was  offered a deal at a time when its supplies of 20% enriched uranium were  nearly depleted, however Iranian lawmakers rejected the deal after  technical studies showed that it would only take two to three months for  any country to further enrich the nuclear stockpile and turn it into  metal nuclear plates for the Tehran Research Reactor, while suppliers  had announced that they would not return fuel to Iran in any time less  than seven months [47]. </p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>Iran has made efforts to ensure the transparency of its nuclear program  by allowing IAEA probes to inspect Iranian sites such as the Parchin  military complex where the agency has reported suspicious activities in  the past [48]. The IAEA’s recent discovery of traces of uranium enriched  up to 27% at Iran’s Fordo enrichment plant sparked controversy,  although the enrichment figure is still substantially below the 90%  level needed to make the fissile core required in nuclear arms;  officials conceded that the likely explanation for the increased level  of enrichment was attributed to centrifuges initially over-enriching at  the start as technicians adjusted their output [49]. It should be noted  that former chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Hans  Blix has challenged the IAEA’s own reports on Iran’s nuclear activities,  accusing the agency of relying on unverified intelligence from the US  and Israel [50]; the IAEA’s most recent report cited Tehran’s progress  toward enrichment technology with complete cooperation with the agency  and confirms the non-weaponized status of Iranian nuclear activities  [51]. </p>

<p>Clinton Bastin, former director of US nuclear weapons production  programs, has sent an open letter to President Obama regarding the  status of Iran’s capacity to produce nuclear weapons [52]. Bastin  reiterates, “The ultimate product of Iran’s gas centrifuge facilities  would be highly enriched uranium hexafluoride, a gas that cannot be used  to make a weapon. Converting the gas to metal, fabricating components  and assembling them with high explosives using dangerous and difficult  technology that has never been used in Iran would take many years after a  diversion of three tons of low enriched uranium gas from fully  safeguarded inventories. The resulting weapon, if intended for delivery  by missile, would have a yield equivalent to that of a kiloton of  conventional high explosives” [53]. The US-based Institute for Science  and International Security (ISIS) has recently released claims that  Iran’s total production of enriched uranium over the past five years  would be enough for at least five nuclear weapons stating, “This total  amount of 3.5 percent low enriched uranium hexafluoride, if further  enriched to weapon grade, is enough to make over five nuclear weapons.”  [54] </p>
<p>Bastin’s assessment of Iran’s nuclear program further emphasizes the  impracticality of weaponizing the hexafluoride product of Tehran’s  gas-centrifuges, as the resulting deterrent would yield the equivalent  explosive capacity equal to a kiloton of conventional explosives,  producing a highly inefficient nuclear weapon. If Iran chose to produce  nuclear weapons in this way, it would take several years to reach the  90% enrichment levels needed for a nuclear deterrent; Iran has complied  with the IAEA and the United Nations on this issue and there is no  substantial evidence indicating that Tehran has any intention of  enriching uranium to 90% for the purpose of creating nuclear weapons. On  March 23rd, 2012, Reuters released a special report entitled, “<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/23/iran-usa-nuclear-idUSL2E8EGEKT20120323" style="color: red">Intel shows Iran nuclear threat not imminent</a>”,  concluding that the United States, its European allies and even Israel  agree that Tehran does not have a bomb, it has not decided to build one,  and it is years away from having a deliverable nuclear warhead [55]. As  the West continually implements an unyielding regime of sanctions  against Iran when they themselves acknowledge the civilian nature of the  Iranian nuclear program, the overwhelming motive behind their actions  to pressure Iran into full-scale war on an unprecedented scale is  self-evident. </p>
<p>The United States has produced more than 70,000 nuclear weapons between  1951 and 1998 [56], while Israel possess a nuclear weapons stockpile  ranging from 75 to 400 warheads [57]. While the hazardous ramifications  of Iran’s nuclear development pervade public consciousness, the fact  that US legal doctrine has worked to further blur the line between  conventional and nuclear warfare remains rarely acknowledged. The March  2005 <a href="http://zfacts.com/metaPage/lib/zFacts_2005_03_15_Joint_Nuclear_Operations.pdf" style="color: red">Doctrine for Joint Nuclear Operations</a>  released by the Joint Chiefs of Staff envisages “contingency plans” for  an offensive first strike use of nuclear weapons against both Iran and  North Korea, providing the legal mandate to carry out pre-emptive  nuclear war, both in terms of military planning as well as defense  procurement and production [58] The 2002 adoption of the Pentagon’s 2001  Nuclear Posture Review by the US Congress marked the cease of  prohibition on low yield nuclear weapons and provided funding  allocations to pursue the development of tactical nuclear weapons, such  as bunker buster (earth penetrator) mini-nukes [59].  </p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both;text-align: center"><a href="https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/doctrine-for-joint-nuclear-operations3.jpg" style="clear: left;float: left;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-right: 1em"><img border="0" height="200" src="https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/doctrine-for-joint-nuclear-operations2.jpg" width="154"></a></div>
<p>The revised Doctrine for Joint Nuclear Operations (March 2005) envisaged  five scenarios where “the use of nuclear weapons might be requested,”  namely, “to attack adversary installations including weapons of mass  destruction, deep, hardened bunkers containing chemical or biological  weapons, or the command and control infrastructure required for the  adversary to execute a WMD attack against the United States or its  friends and allies” and “to counter potentially overwhelming adversary  conventional forces”. The doctrine further cites, “Responsible security  planning requires preparation for threats that are possible, though  perhaps unlikely today. The lessons of military history remain clear:  unpredictable, irrational conflicts occur.</p>
<p>Military forces must prepare  to counter weapons and capabilities that exist in the near term even if  no immediate likely scenarios for war are at hand. <i>To maximize  deterrence of WMD use, it is essential US forces prepare to use nuclear  weapons effectively and that US forces are determined to employ nuclear  weapons if necessary to prevent or retaliate against WMD use</i>” [60]. </p>
<p>The possibility of nuclear strikes against Iran pose staggeringly  frightening implications for the human family, as the very nations  crying foul about the danger of nuclear weapons have prepared the legal  infrastructure to use them against others, preemptively. While trust  towards the Iranian regime remains questionable among segments of the  Iranian population and the international community, Tehran has complied  with the IAEA and no evidence exists to implicate Iran with constructing  a nuclear weapon. While the fiery rhetoric of Iranian and Israeli  officials remains entirely counterproductive, Tel Aviv has shown the  least initiative to constructively partake in diplomacy with Iran, as  top Israeli officials refuse to even meet with US envoy to the P5+1,  Wendy Sherman, who reportedly was sent to Tel Aviv to “reaffirm our  unshakable commitment to Israel’s security” [61]. As Israel aggressively  employs an apartheid policy domestically, nuclear-armed Tel Aviv boasts  its right to strike Iran without consent from any other nation [62]. As  our species approaches the increasingly dangerous crossroads of the  21st Century, nations such as Germany, Russia, India and China must  utilize their collective influence and technology to mediate this  impending security crisis in the Middle East. </p>
<p>Although Iran has asserted its right to develop peaceful nuclear  technology as a signatory to the nuclear non-Proliferation Treaty, its  uranium-based fuel has wrought negative and inaccurate accusations  regarding Tehran’s intentions to weaponize. To ensure the further  deflection of erroneous accusations, Iran can truly make an example of  itself by phasing out uranium-based nuclear technology and shifting to a  liquid fuel based on molten-fluoride salts used in Liquid Fluoride  Thorium Reactor (LFTR) nuclear technology powered by thorium, an  obscure, mildly radioactive metal produced as a waste product from the  mining of rare earth minerals. Thorium is plentiful, easily accessible  and energy dense, a metric ton produces as much energy as 200 tons of  uranium, or 3,500,000 ton of coal [63]. Thorium-based reactors consume  their own hazardous waste and would serve Iran’s internal needs far more  effectively than its current technology. As a nuclear fuel, thorium is  both cleaner and safer than uranium and produces benign alpha radiation,  unable to even penetrate skin [64].  </p>
<p>The governments of China [65] and India [66] have expressed great  interest in further developing thorium molten-salt reactor technology.  Iran holds 9% of the world’s oil reserves and 17% of its natural gas  reserves; the abundant supply of fossil fuel resources has indirectly  discouraged the pursuit of alternative renewable energy sources [67].  Iran has enormous potential as a producer of geothermal energy,  particularly in the provinces of Azerbaijan and Tehran [68]. There is no  shortage of solutions to the current problems faced by the  international community in its efforts to oversee peaceful energy  technology in Iran. China, Germany and India could share their growing  technical expertise with Iran to develop energy solutions that can never  be used as a pretext for external military strikes. No credible basis  exists to warrant the implementation of economic sanctions against Iran,  which are ostensibly in place to coax social unrest and collapse the  Iranian economy. </p>
<p>For all the belligerence exuded by the current Iranian regime, the  unwavering aggressive it receives from outside forces does nothing to  offer the people of Iran any tangible solutions to better themselves and  their standard of living. Although the further application of sanctions  will inevitably have damaging effects on Tehran, inflated oil price  fluctuations have the potential to fracture the fledging  austerity-states of the European Union. The failure of emerging markets  to adhere to full embargoes on Iran once they come into effect would  send a strong message to the architects of such disastrous policy. As  nations such as China and Russia acknowledge the imbalanced nature of  power in the Security Council and the aggressive stance of the United  States and Israel, these nations can best utilize their power by  offering technological and diplomatic solutions to avert the detrimental  social, economic and spiritual consequences of war. <b></b><i> </i></p>

<p>The “1%’s” elite <a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/bilderberg-2012-may-31-june-3-chantilly-va-shaping-the-1-s-crimes-lies">Bilderberg meeting</a> concludes today. The Guardian, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian" rel="nofollow">UK’s second-leading online newspaper</a>, has reported on Bilderberg the last three years; their reporter <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/search?q=bilderberg&amp;section=" rel="nofollow">Charlie Skelton</a> explains Bilderberg in this <a href="http://www.infowars.com/bilderberg-and-the-european-unions-cia-and-mi6-roots/" rel="nofollow">17-minute interview</a> with <a href="http://www.infowars.com/" rel="nofollow">InfoWars</a>.</p>
<p>Video Rebel’s Blog <a href="http://vidrebel.wordpress.com/2012/06/03/annotated-bilderberg-2012-member-list/" rel="nofollow">brilliantly documents</a>  Bilderberg participants’ biographies; I’m re-posting here with a few edits. I  recognize some of the factual claims, and have not done the immense work  to verify and document all of them.</p>
<p>Readers are advised to do their own  research and thinking, as always. I appreciate Video Rebel’s leadership  of factual discovery.</p>
<p>The “emperor has no clothes” obvious conclusion regarding Bilderberg is that the 1%’s policies in war and money are unlawful, annually kill millions, harm billions, and loot trillions of the 99%’s wealth. The only ethical, rational, and lawful response is to arrest obvious leaders to end these crimes: </p>
<ol>
<li>The wars are Orwellian unlawful because <a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/how-a-government-teacher-easily-proves-occupy-s-claim-of-us-war-crimes">war law</a> makes armed attack illegal unless first attacked by another nation’s government. </li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/2-minute-video-kucinich-explains-monetary-reform-full-employment-new-cities">Using debt as a so-called money supply</a> is economic criminal fraud because it creates ever-increasing aggregate debt that can never be repaid (because that’s what we use for money). This is just <a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/how-an-economics-teacher-presents-occupy-s-economic-argument-victory">one cartel of many</a> that shift trillions of the 99%’s wealth to the 1%.</li>
<li>The crimes and lies are only possible through <a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/why-everyone-should-occupy-us-1-corporate-media-they-lie">corporate media’s complicity</a>.</li>
</ol>

<a name="more"></a><b>Video Rebel’s documentation: </b></p>
<p>The 2012 members list released by the Bilderbergers is most remarkable for what it does not mention. The incoming chairman runs one of the biggest insurance companies in the world. Many members own banks. Europe requires banks and insurance companies to buy toxic national bonds. Wouldn’t it be nice if Ben Bernanke would print up 10 or 20 trillion dollars and swap out toxic assets for international bonds.</p>

<p>
Kevin Warsh who is listed as a college professor is a former member of the Bush Plunge Protection team and a member of the Federal Reserve Board. Warsh is highly recommended by his friend Bernanke. That is good news for billionaires but might not be good news for you. </p>
<p>Professor Lipsky just happened to be ex-Managing Director of the IMF and is an expert on Greek finances and European bailouts. Daniel Estulin says Bilderberg will discuss devaluing the dollar.  I think their ultimate goal is Hyperinflation. </p>

These men are bankers and are experiencing runs on their banks. He created more than 30 trillion dollars to help the banks cover up bank frauds, bad investments and stupidity.

Donilon has no military experience but was intimately involved in many major foreign policy issues, including negotiating the Bosnian peace agreement and the expansion of NATO. His predecessor at NSA General Jones criticized his poor handling of staff and lack of experience. He made up for his lack of overseas experience by joining Obama on his surprise 6 hour trip to Afghanistan. Donilon was a key architect of Obama’s Afghanistan policy and we can see how well worked. His 5 fold escalation of the use of drones has NOT improved America’s image there and in Pakistan. His wife and his brother work for VP Joe Biden. </p>
<p><b>Dudley</b>, Robert   GB   Group Chief Executive, BP plc. The Bilderbergers are strong in oil and not just banking and war. They have ties to Shell, EXXON, and BP. </p>

He is an official biographer of Henry Kissinger and has written about the Rothschild family. He represents the latter at Bilderberg. He is an economic historian and one of his areas of expertise is Hyperinflation. He has said the euro is doomed and can only be saved by more centralization (and less democracy). We will all become experts in Hyperinflation at the rate at which the  Bilderbergers are printing money. They are intentionally creating more debts so taxpayers will all become permanent debt slaves. </p>
<p><b>Flint</b>, Douglas J.   GB   Group Chairman, HSBC Holdings plc. HSBC is an old drug running bank better known as Hong Kong Shanghai Bank Corp. A former partner in KPMG. Asia Times tells us that the big banks launder 500 billion dollars a year in bribes and that 40% of that money goes to Chinese politicians. He should have extensive contacts with both Chinese politicians and drug cartels. </p>

She criticized the press for demonizing China during the 2008 Olympics. Bilderbergers shipped American jobs to China so we would have no industrial base and would therefore lose WW III. </p>
<p><b>Gallagher</b>, Paul  Ireland   Former Attorney General; Senior Counsel. Irish people should all hang their heads in shame over this government which indebted the Irish people to pay for the speculative losses of English owned banks. <a href="http://www.irishholocaust.com/">www.IrishHolocaust.com</a> has a map on the left of its main page which shows 300 sites for mass graves for Irishmen who were deliberately starved to death. No local groups have to date been willing to receive the historical markers he would love to donate. </p>
<p><b>Gephardt</b>, Richard A.  USA   President and CEO, Gephardt Group. He is a former Democratic Majority leader in the US House. He ran for President in 2004 indicating he was delusional. Mentioned as a possible VP nominee several times indicating the party had the good sense to reject him. He is a lobbyist and labor consultant meaning he still has enough friends to get things done. </p>
<p><b>Giannitsis</b>, Anastasios   Greece   Former Minister of Interior; Professor of Development and International Economics, University of Athens. All references to him are in Greek. I studied classical Greek but the translate button said in one article that students in Athens were angry with him. This is understandable. The Greek government which was appointed by the Bilderbergers seized all the money from the universities and sent it to pay bond holders forcing the schools to close. No refunds for tuition already paid and classes were cancelled. The brother of former Prime Minister George Papandreou had a government job that probably never paid more than $60,000 a year bought an island with a mansion paying 750  million dollars for it. Do you wonder why the Greeks are a little angry. Elderly people have jumped off buildings because they have nothing to eat. </p>
<p><b>Goolsbee</b>, Austan D.  USA  Professor of Economics, University of Chicago Booth School of Business. He is a member of the Skull and Bones Society as were John Kerry and George W Bush. He has been an Obama advisor since 2004. He was Chairman if Obama’s Council of Economic Advisors. He quit advising Obama because he can see where this economy is going. </p>
<p><b>Graham</b>, Donald E.  USA    Chairman and CEO, The Washington Post Company. His mother was the late Katherine Meyer. He is on the board of directors of Facebook. The Washington Post never runs stories on the Bilderberg Society. </p>
<p><b>Gruber</b>, Lilli    -Italian Journalist – Anchorwoman, La 7 TV  She is a native speaker of Italian and German. She was critical of Berlusconi, quit her state TV job and became a Euro MP. She returned to TV. She is fluent in English and has worked as a war correspondent.<br />
Gucht, Karel de   International   Commissioner for Trade, European Commission He is a Belgian and was a former Foreign Affairs Minister for Belgium. As stated previously, the EU is not a democracy. It is a dictatorship run by the EU Commission. He did say, “Do not underestimate the Jewish lobby on Capitol Hill.” </p>
<p><b>Halberstadt</b>, Victor   Netherlands   Professor of Economics, Leiden University; Former Honorary Secretary  General of Bilderberg Meetings. </p>
<p><b>Harris</b>, Britt    USA     CIO, Teacher Retirement System of Texas. It costs $19,000 to attend Bilderberg. I wonder if those school teachers back home will think this is money well spent when they figure out that their pensions will soon be cancelled through Hyperinflation.<br />
Hoffman, Reid    USA    Co-founder and Executive Chairman, LinkedIn. He is part of the New Guard. They are making an effort in partnership with the CIA and the NSA to control the Internet and to eliminate dissent. </p>
<p><b>Huang</b>, Yiping    China    Professor of Economics, China Center for Economic Research, Peking University. He was previously Managing Director and Chief Asia Economist for Citigroup based in Hong Kong. He also taught at Columbia University in New York. </p>
<p><b>Huntsman</b>, Jr. Jon M.   USA  Chairman, Huntsman Cancer Foundation. He is a billionaire and promoted Chinese interests in America. I would expect him to spend his time evenly split between promoting Chinese interests and the presidential campaign of his fellow Mormon Mitt Romney. There is too much media attention for either Obama or Romney to show up at this meeting. </p>
<p><b>Ischinger</b>, Wolfgang    Germany     Chairman, Munich Security Conference; Global Head Government Relations, Allianz SE  He has served as ambassador to the UK and to the USA. He earned a Master’s degree from the Fletcher School of Law in the US. </p>
<p><b>Ivanov</b>, Igor S.   Russia    Associate member, Russian Academy of Science; President, Russian International Affairs Council. Former Foreign Affairs Minister. He resigned from the Putin administration. He favors Europe as a partner for Russia though he does not like US-NATO encirclement of Russia. He tries to avoid partisan domestic politics. This meeting is loading up with anti-Putin critics. </p>
<p><b>Izraelewicz</b>, Erik  France  CEO, Le Monde  He has a doctorate in international economy.<br />
Jacobs, Kenneth M.   USA    Chairman and CEO of Rothschild owned Lazard. </p>
<p><b>Johnson</b>, James A.    USA   Vice Chairman, Perseus, LLC. He selects VP candidates for the Democrats. He had something of a mortgage scandal in 2008 and his candidate Kathleen Sebelius  was rejected by Obama as he does not like women which is unusual for a gay man. Biden became VP.  I see no obvious VP replacement at this meeting. Hillary does not want it. She might be drafted to replace Obama if the bottom falls out of everything. The Bilderbergers will print money like mad to avoid a collapse before the US November elections. Europe has a lot of elections scheduled too. </p>
<p><b>Johnson</b>, Ron    USA     This list is of those who volunteer their names to be made public. Senator Johnson is rumored to be attending to interview for the position as Romney’s VP. If he did go, you might see favorable press for this freshman Wisconsin senator. Mitch Daniels has too much baggage with all of his austerity cuts. And I have never seen 2 governors on the same ticket. Governor Christie is too fat to run for anything. </p>
<p><b>Jordan</b>, Jr., Vernon E.    USA    Senior Managing Director, Lazard. He was on the assassination list with Martin Luther King Jr. He escaped with his life and I do not blame him for going to work for the Rothschilds to avoid being killed. King was killed because of his anti-war activities. Peace is forbidden. </p>
<p><b>Karp</b>, Alexander    USA    CEO, Palantir Technologies. This high tech company was created with seed money from the CIA so I do not believe those claims about protecting user privacy. </p>
<p><b>Karsner</b>, Alexander   USA   Executive Chairman, Manifest Energy, Inc and Former Energy Secretary. </p>
<p><b>Karvar</b>, Anousheh    France    Inspector, Inter-ministerial Audit and Evaluation Office for Social, Health, Employment and Labor Policies. Probably invited because the Bilderbergers want to lower pay and working conditions. </p>
<p><b>Kasparov</b>, Garry   Russia    Chairman, United Civil Front. Not invited to play chess. He is a leading Putin critic. I think Putin developed a counter strategy as soon as he saw this guest list. This meeting also has a lot of Chinese, as well as  Americans who do their bidding here.</p>
<p><b>Kerr</b>, John     GB     Independent Member, House of Lords and Deputy Chairman of Royal Dutch Shell  He was a professional diplomat and ambassador to Russia, the US Pakistan and the EU. He is a director of Rio Tinto, a Rothschild company. </p>
<p><b>Kerry</b>, John   USA   Senator for Massachusetts. Member of Skull and Bones. If he had a brain, he would be finishing his second term as President. His brother Cameron is bag man for the loot. </p>
<p><b>Keyman</b>, E. Fuat     Turkey     Director, Istanbul Policy Center and Professor of International Relations, Sabanci University. He received his doctorate from Carleton University of Canada. His works are mainly on the theories of globalization and the notion of citizenship. He also studies the place of Turkey in world politics  I have news for him. Empires do not have citizens. They have Emperors, nobles and slaves. </p>
<p><b>Kissinger</b>, Henry A.   USA    Chairman, Kissinger Associates, Inc. Treasury Secretary Geithner’s first job was at Kissinger Associates. Geithner’s father was a director of the Ford Foundation in Asia which is to say he outranked run of the mill CIA agents. His father was a boss for Obama’s mother. Kissinger is wanted for war crimes. He is a very big supporter of population reduction (i.e. killing billions of poor people.) Lest you think you are exempt please note that in a Hyperinflation your wages will be cut in half for openers and things will go down hill from there. In Argentina middle class families fed themselves from what they found in garbage cans. </p>
<p><b>Kleinfeld</b>, Klaus   USA    Chairman and CEO, Alcoa and former CEO of Siemens AG. though he had to quit Siemens over corruption charges. He is a member of the board of directors of Citigroup and Bayer. </p>

His company is the largest in Turkey and partners with many foreign corporations making light bulbs and cars. He is a member of the New York Yacht Club. He hired Peter Sutherland a former Head of Bilderberg Europe. That is one way to be invited. </p>

<p><b>Kodmani</b>, Bassma     International     Member of the Executive Bureau and Head of Foreign Affairs, Syrian National Council which is using mercenaries to overthrow the current regime. She is the Executive Director of the Arab Reform Initiative, a network of independent Arab research and policy institutes working to promote democracy in the Arab world. She worked for the Ford Foundation which is a bad sign for Syrians. </p>
<p><b>Kravis</b>, Henry R.   USA    Co-Chairman and Co-CEO, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. When they bought R J Reynolds, Catherine Austin Fitts couldn’t understand  how they could pay so much. She learned that Reynolds sold cigarettes to terrorists and drug dealers so they could launder money. They take over companies and steal their pensions. </p>
<p><b>Kravis</b>, Marie-Josée    USA    Senior Fellow, Hudson Institute which is funded by Eli Lily. She is from Montreal, Quebec, and is the third wife of financier Henry Kravis. </p>
<p><b>Kroes</b>, Neelie    International   Vice President, European Commission; Commissioner for Digital Agenda. She is a member of the Dutch Peoples Party.  She is needed to shut down the Internet. </p>
<p><b>Krupp</b>, Fred     USA    President, Environmental Defense Fund. This fund is there to make sure poor people who survive the coming population decline have no rural areas where they can thrive. The earth belongs to the billionaires. See Agenda 21 on the web. </p>
<p><b>Lamy</b>, Pascal     International     Director-General, World Trade Organization.He is Honorary President of Paris-based think tank Notre Europe. He is a member of the French Socialist party. He ran the European Commission and hence Europe as as a dictatorship even though he was merely the chief assistant to the first Commission President. The WTO raises corporations and their needs above national laws canceling environmental, consumer and labor laws. </p>
<p><b>Letta</b>, Enrico    Italy     Deputy Leader, Democratic Party (PD). His government was dissolved and replaced by Bilderbergers and Goldman Sachs appointees. As a liberal, what does he hope to accomplish for the Italian people at this conclave of billionaires? </p>
<p><b>Levite</b>, Ariel E.    Israel     Nonresident Senior Associate, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace for nuclear affairs. The Israelis do have nuclear weapons and Iran does not have them. The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace pleaded with President Woodrow Wilson to not prematurely end World War I. He also worked for RAND, a Pentagon think tank. </p>
<p><b>Li</b>, Cheng     USA    Director of Research and Senior Fellow, John L. Thornton China Center, Brookings Institution.  Li focuses on the transformation of political leaders, generational change and technological development in China.  He has a PhD. from Princeton.The billionaires seem to like China’s low wages and to dislike Putin for saying No. You do realize that debt slaves never have the right to say No. </p>
<p><b>Lipsky</b>, John     USA    Distinguished Visiting Scholar, Johns Hopkins University. He was acting managing director at the IMF. He also worked for Salomon Brothers and J P Morgan banks. His latest stint at IMF led him to concentrate on the Greek and EU debt crises.</p>

Rumsfeld announced on September 10, 2001 that the DOD could not trace 2.3 trillion dollars while he was doing procuring for the Pentagon and for Raytheon as a lobbyist. Obama hired him again after the scandal of the missing trillions and promising not to hire lobbyists.  On 9-11-2001, bombs went off killing the military auditors before what was alleged to be Flight 77 hit the building. Flight 77 was 5 minutes away according to Dulles airport radar when the bombs went off.</p>
<p><b>Mandelson</b>, Peter   GB   Member, House of Lords; Chairman, Global Counsel. Mandelson was a longtime MP for Labor. He represented the interests of the Rothschilds and Israel.

He is a member of the Steering Committee and had to approve the invitations to the other high tech attendees. Mundie advocates that individuals be licensed before being allowed to use the Internet. </p>

<p><b>H.M. Beatrix</b>, the Queen of the Netherlands.  Her father founded Bilderberg. Her family owns a large part of Royal Dutch Shell along with the Queen of England and the Rothschilds. Forbes magazine did a puff piece and said she had only 300 million dollars. This is not credible for a family that ruled for 200 years. </p>
<p><b>Nin</b> Génova, Juan María    Spain     Deputy Chairman and CEO, Caixabank This is an old bank that merged with others. It has lots of pensions and savings from Spanish workers. Spain is experiencing bank runs. Americans do not realize that there is not just one euro but 17 or one different euro for every country in the Eurozone. Each euro note is marked by the country of issue. If Greece and Germany drop out, Greek euros will be exchanged for drachmas and German euros for Deutschmarks. Now the danger to anyone not holding German euros is clear. The Germans will be better off. And that is why money is flying out of the country though I would have expected more capital flight. The dollar measured against a basket of currencies has risen in value of late which has appeared to Americans to slow inflation. When this euro run is over, American banks will have to pay on tens of trillions in Credit Default Swaps. President Obama has guaranteed that American taxpayers will pay off these CDS. They are nothing more than fraudulent insurance that does not set aside money to pay claims. I calculate that we might be able to pay off all of these debts if Obama and the Congress raise taxes to 100% for a thousand years. </p>
<p>The Bilderbergers are planning to devalue the dollar. Hyperinflation will be here as soon as that happens. The alternative is a scientific and rational debt cancellation as explained in the notes. </p>
<p><b>Noonan</b>, Michael    Ireland      Minister for Finance. Fine Gael politician.The IRA spent their time receiving illegal drugs from MI6 and sharing the incoming loads often times with Protestant militia men. They set off some bombs.

Noonan is a trustee of the Manhattan Institute. She allowed her name to be published as did others on this list. What are they thinking? Don’t they see the signs of collapse and revolt everywhere. Noonan grew up in Brooklyn and should know better. </p>
<p><b>Ollila</b>, Jorma   Finland   Chairman, Royal Dutch Shell, plc. He is also Chairman  of Nokia. He worked for 8 years at Citibank’s London office. I suppose you have noticed that the oil companies are well represented. </p>

He probably quit OMB when he got a good look at the books. He is on the Board of the Pete Peterson Institute, a policy group that favors drastic austerity cuts. These cuts will not work.

<p><b>Pechtold</b>, Alexander   Holland   Parliamentary Leader, Democrats ’66 (D66) He is a liberal. The current government collapsed over a failure  to pass austerity and elections will be held in a few months. Bankers love austerity. They killed a minimum of 3 million Americans through starvation in the Great Depression. They want him to vote for austerity in the next parliament. Support for austerity is declining amongst the voters. </p>
<p><b>Perle</b>, Richard N.    USA    Resident Fellow, American Enterprise Institute    He began as a  senior staff member to Senator Henry “Scoop” Jackson and served as the assistant Secretary of Defense for Ronald Regan. He was a member Project for the New American Century (PNAC) . In the Clinton years he went to Israel where he accepted citizenship and wrote “A Clean Break: A New Strategy for Securing the Realm”. This was written onto PNAC and became US doctrine in the early Bush years.PNAC documents spoke of a need for a new Pearl Harbor. </p>
<p>On September 11, 2001 we saw 2 buildings hit by planes but 3 buildings fell down including WTC 7, a 47 story building, which collapsed 22 minutes after it was announced by BBC. The Rothschild owned Reuters had told the BBC that the building had collapsed. The UK had just gone off Summer Time but America was still on Daylight Savings time so there was a temporary time difference. Go to YouTube and type in WTC 7 BBC. The longest version will show the collapse. Look at it for the first time. Note that the windows did not melt. Glass melts at 800 degrees Fahrenheit (426.66 degrees Celsius). WTC 7 collapses in 6.5 seconds meaning that all of the steel girders melted at 2,200 degrees  on all 47 floors at the same time but that none of the windows melted. Sounds like a controlled demolition to me.  There were 110 stories each in the Twin Towers with 183 Steel girders making contact on every floor. That is 2 X 110  X 283 for a total of 62,260 connection points between the girders and the floors. Do you believe there was a fire so intense that all 62,260 steel connections melted in less than 2 seconds but there was not enough heat to melt the windows. And while we are at it, what explosive force was required to blow up 500,000 tons  (453,592,400 kilograms) of reinforced concrete and turn it into dust in 2 seconds? </p>
<p>911 was a controlled demolition. And everyone with a brain at Bilderberg knows this and does not care. </p>
<p><b>Polman</b>, Paul     Netherlands     CEO, Unilever PLC. He worked at another Jewish company for a long time at Procter and Gamble in the USA  A member of the board of this company paid George Lincoln Rockwell $50,000 to start a NAZI party. All he asked was that he print a magazine with lots of swastikas so he could scare elderly Jews into donating money. </p>
<p><b>Prichard</b>, J. Robert S   Canada     Chair, Torys LLP a law firm.  Prichard is the President and CEO of  the Toronto Star. He has been involved in political campaigns and has been mentioned as a potential Liberal candidate for PM. </p>
<p><b>Rabinovich</b>, Itamar    Israel   Global Distinguished Professor, New York University. He was the Israel ambassador to the United States from 1993 to 1996. He is an expert on Mideast peace negotiations. </p>
<p><b>Rachman</b>, Gideon    GB   Chief Foreign Affairs  Commentator, The Financial Times. He writes on American foreign policy, the European Union and globalization. In December 2008, Rachman published a controversial blog post on the Financial Times online entitled, “And now for a world government.” </p>
<p><b>Rattner</b>, Steven    USA   Chairman, Willett Advisors LLC which is the investment firm that manages New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s personal and philanthropic assets. He was Obama’s car czar. He was a principal of the Quadrangle Group, a global private equity firm specializing in the media. He is a contributing writer for the Op-Ed page of The New York Times and authors a monthly column for the Financial Times. </p>

<p><b>Redford</b>, Alison M.   Canada    Premier of Alberta  She is a lawyer. Not sure why she was invited. Maybe they see her as a potential replacement for Harper as PM. They have several Liberal leaders present. </p>
<p><b>Reisman</b>, Heather M.   Canada    CEO, Indigo Books &amp; Music Inc. the largest bookstore chain in Canada. Her husband, Gerry Schwartz, runs Onex, a leading venture capital firm. She is listed as a member of the Steering Committee of the Bilderberg Group. She and her husband switched from Liberal to Conservative over the Israel Lebanon war. PM Harper’s Chief of Staff used to work for her husband. </p>
<p><b>Reitzle</b>, Wolfgang     Germany    CEO &amp; President, Linde AG  He was in charge of product development for more than ten years st BMW. He knows the auto business and is a superb design engineer. My first thought is that they want his opinion on a car line to be salvaged or turned around. He is no banker or diplomat but has worked with Ford and Volvo.  The GM car czar was also invited. </p>
<p><b>Rogoff</b>, Kenneth S.     USA      Professor of Economics, Harvard University. He wrote This Time It Is Different with Carmen Reinhard in which they study government defaults. It happens every time bonds equal 90% of GDP. He has no solutions because Bilderbergers want fractional reserve banking and interest bearing currencies. For a solution that actually works see Notes Below. </p>
<p><b>Rose</b>, Charlie    USA   Executive Editor and Anchor, Charlie Rose. He is a long-time fixture on PBS where he does interviews. </p>
<p><b>Ross</b>, Dennis B.     USA     Counselor, Washington Institute for Near East Policy, a Zionist pro-war think tank. He has served as the Director of Policy Planning in the State Department under President George H. W. Bush, the special Middle East coordinator under President Bill Clinton. Ross was appointed Special Advisor for the Persian Gulf and Southwest Asia to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on February 23, 2009. If you want a war,  Perle and Ross are your men. </p>
<p><b>Rostowski</b>, Jacek    Poland   Minister of Finance. He was born and raised in London. His father worked for the British government after the war. He was a member of Britain’s Conservative Party. </p>
<p><b>Rubin</b>, Robert E.     USA       Co-Chair, Council on Foreign Relations; Former Secretary of the Treasury. He was head of Citibank’s private bank which launders drug money.  In 1999 Robert Rubin, Alan Greenspan, Larry Summers (Samuelson) and Arthur Levitt told Brooksley Born of the CFTC that she could not regulate Credit Default Swaps which were faux insurance. They were unregulated and did not require the seller to set aside money to pay claims. All sales income could be paid out in bonuses allowing the taxpayer to foot the bill when it came due as it did in AIG. American taxpayers according to Obama will have to pay hundreds of trillions of dollars in CDS after the euro bonds collapse. No concern to them that a billion people at some future date will starve to death. </p>
<p><b>Rutte</b>, Mark     Netherlands     Prime Minister. He is a liberal and tried to pass austerity cuts. PVV leader Geert Wilders withdrew his party’s support. The government fell and elections will be held on September 12th. Bankers love austerity. </p>
<p><b>Sáenz</b> de Santamaría Antón, Soraya        Spain           Vice President and Minister for the Presidency. She is party spokeswoman. But austerity is a hard sell.  People are fooled by sham democracies and believe things will change if their party wins. The people in Spain are figuring this out and taking their euros out of the banks. Bankers have no solutions that benefit the people because they despise us. </p>
<p><b>Scheffer</b>, Paul     Netherlands      Professor of European Studies, Tilburg University He is a prominent member of the Dutch Labour Party. The central idea of his book is that “immigration always has been and is a process of alienation for both the newcomers and the natives”. Maybe the bankers want to figure out an election strategy that will keep the anti-austerity and anti-immigration  Wilders from winning the September elections. </p>
<p><b>Schmidt</b>, Eric E.       USA         Executive Chairman, Google Inc. He has worked at Sun and Apple.  Google is a superior search engine and was designed that way by the CIA-DARPA hive. It was given to the founders as was a lot of new technology. It is given on the condition that the  CIA and NSA are allowed to spy on us. Considering the laws against Internet freedom being proposed we can only assume they will try to close Internet freedom. But the markets and the dollar will crash soon and we can go on the offensive. </p>
<p><b>Scholten</b>, Rudolf     Austria    Member of the Board of Executive Directors, Oesterreichische Kontrollbank AG  He is head of the Austrian Central Bank.  The Great Depression did not get going until the Credit Anstalt bank of Vienna collapsed on May 11, 1931. It had too many eastern European bad debts. This man is not a professional banker. They probably are worried about bank run contagion and rightly so. </p>
<p><b>Senard</b>, Jean-Dominique    France     CEO, Michelin Group His French bio says he is interested mostly in world affairs. The bankers want several men from key industries in every nation to accept their goals and to infect business people back home with globalization.<br />
Shambaugh, David     USA      Director, China Policy Program, George Washington University. He has a dozen publications about China. This meeting is looking forward to a Chinese future or more likely a return on their investments in Asia. </p>
<p><b>Sheeran</b>, Josette    International     Vice Chairman, World Economic Forum and formerly head of  the UN World Food Program. I am immediately suspicious of anyone who worked for the UN and was appointed by Kofi Anan. She was a member of Reverend Moon’s Unification Church. She is an American. </p>
<p><b>Siilasmaa</b>, Risto     Finland      Chairman of the Board of Directors, Nokia Corporation.  Nokia carries a lot of weight in Scandinavia. Several men have Nokia in their resume.  He also founded an anti computer virus firm which might be of note. </p>
<p><b>Speyer</b>,  Jerry I.    USA      Chairman and Co-CEO, Tishman Speyer    Speyer is deputy chair and a member of the Executive Committee of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, He is on the Board of RAND, a Pentagon think tank. He owns a lot of New York real estate and quite a bit in Latin America. He is well connected in New York Democratic politics. </p>
<p><b>Supino</b>, Pietro     Switzerland     Chairman and Publisher, Tamedia AG  He is a lawyer who specializes in patents and trusts. Wealthy people are interested in controlling the media. The Swiss media in undergoing a merger. Hos family has famous art collections and is well known. He has dual Swiss and Italian citizenship. </p>
<p><b>Sutherland</b>, Peter D.    Ireland      Chairman, Goldman Sachs International He was  Ireland’s youngest Attorney General. He was appointed European Commission for Competition. He was called ‘the father of globalization’ for his service as Director of what became the World Trade Organization. He is on the Bilderberg Steering Committee. He is a former Chairman of the Trilateral Commission. </p>
<p><b><a href="http://activistpost.net/goldbuyer.html" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="noshadow" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/_qLAIskTQXUc/TaOlw7ipCUI/AAAAAAAAIKY/jxH8DqZiOtw/Gold_Buyer_cover.jpg" style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% transparent" width="175"></a>Thiel</b>, Peter A    USA    President, Clarium Capital / Thiel Capital. He is on the Bilderberg Steering Committee. He gave 2.7 million dollars to Ron Paul but that is not a significant indicator of Bilderberg policy. I do not think this was a cynical ploy to recruit Rand Paul as Romney’s VP. Thiel is on the Steering Committee and is bringing in the younger crowd of high tech billionaires the CIA and NSA will need to end anonymity on the Internet and then close down free speech. It should be noted that he is not an engineer. He is a lawyer and Stanford graduate. He worked as a derivatives trader and runs a Hedge Fund. He owned 10.2% of Facebook pre IPO. Mundie wants licensing for Internet users. A license that can be revoked at the whim of a billionaire. Thiel is a founder of PayPal which shuts down service to those who practice free speech on the Internet. He was an early investor in Facebook which legally should never had been offered as an IPO at anything above a dollar a share.</p>
<p><b>Timuray</b>, Serpil   Turkey     CEO, Vodafone. This UK based company is second in size in its field only to China Mobile. </p>
<p><b>Trittin</b>, Jürgen      Germany     Parliamentary Leader, Alliance 90/The Greens The Greens might wind up in a coalition government as they did in Australia where they did all sorts of wonderful things for billionaires by passing carbon taxes and making it illegal to criticize this obvious scam. He is an extreme environmentalist but did ask Angela Merkel to expel a man from her government who had said a Greek bankruptcy might be a good thing for the Eurozone. </p>
<p>He opposed nuclear power before Fukushima. I would like to point out that the US government took all of Nikola Tesla/s research and worked on it in secret labs with billions in research money. There are people who are sitting on these scientific advances because they want to rule the world after they have starved a billion people to death and killed a few billion with plagues. We could produce clean energy, cut utility bills by 2/3rds and get the economy moving if the Bilderbergers and their known associates were arrested. </p>
<p><b>Tsoukalis</b>, Loukas     Greece     President, Hellenic Foundation for European and Foreign Policy. He has written on European expansion which he accepts. He just wants them to not forget democracy and social welfare as  Europe becomes a single state. He needs to look at the European Commission. They are not democratic. And he can forget social welfare. </p>
<p>Please Sir, take a look at the people of Athens. What you see is what you will get more of. He signed a petition asking European leaders for leniency in the case of Greece. Maybe they will offer him a bone that will help the pro euro forces against the pro default forces.The Greeks want to stay on the EU but do not want to pay those debts most of which are odious and subject to default under international law. </p>
<p><b>Urpilainen</b>, Jutta      Finland      Minister of Finance and Deputy Prime Minister. She is a former school teacher. She is also chairwoman of the SDP. She will be important as Finland after Germany is the one nation in Europe expected to pay for this banker inflicted disaster. The Dutch have no government. And Francois Hollande is a disgrace. Wait until his party sees the results from the parliamentary elections. There are no anti-banker parties in Europe outside of Greece. </p>
<p><b>Vasella</b>, Daniel L.    Switzerland    Chairman, Novartis AG. a large pharmaceutical company. Typical Bilderberger medical man. He has an actual medical degree. But he also went into the Harvard MBA program. I might not be alone in thinking that this medical model screams for reform. His wife is the niece of the former CEO of Sandoz. </p>
<p>I believe drug companies should pay for the government to run trials for new drugs and require them to be tested against home remedies alternative doctors are currently using. All drugs would be re-tested. The drug company would pay for the trial but a committee of doctors  would administer the alternative treatment.  For example, give 100,000 patients Vitamin D-3 and cinnamon to stabilize their diabetes. Test them monthly. They should do as well as drugged patients after 3 months with far fewer side effects. Beneficial side effects for Vitamin D3 are fewer winter colds and flu and a reduction of 72% of the incidence of a dozen different cancers. As soon as the results have verified, the government can issue a decree allowing insurance companies to refuse payment for any drug ruled to produce no better results than a home remedy. This would require corporations to focus on real treatments and cures. </p>
<p><b>Vimont</b>, Pierre    International      Executive Secretary General, European External Action Service. This is an EU position. Previously, Sarkozy had appointed him to be ambassador to the US. He had served at the French embassy in London. He is a professional civil servant in the French sense of the word. He can represent the EU to Bilderberg. </p>
<p><b>Voser</b>, Peter     GB     CEO, Royal Dutch Shell plc. He is Swiss born and a former CFO and not an engineer. He is taking over the St Gallen Forum from Josef Ackerman from Deutsche Bank. The forum gets potential leaders of tomorrow together with today’s leaders. Sounds like brain washing to me. How about a discussion of the Tesla technology the US government has been sitting on for 70 years. It would put the oil companies out of business. Bilderberg has a lot of oil companies represented at their meetings. </p>
<p><b>Wallenberg</b>, Jacob      Sweden      Chairman, Investor AB.  He is a member of the famous Wallenberg family. He is a Director of several banks and of Coca-Cola. In Latin America the Coca-Cola bottler is usually on speed dial of the local CIA station chief. The current President of Mexico is a prime example. </p>
<p><b>Warsh</b>, Kevin    USA    Distinguished Visiting Fellow, The Hoover Institution, Stanford University. He is a lawyer. He was Vice President and Executive Director in ‘Morgan Stanley’s Mergers and Acquisitions Department. He then worked for President Bush in the Plunge Protection Team. This group tries to make dumb billionaires look smart by buying stocks and sending share prices higher. This disguises bad policies for the government as well. In 2006 he was appointed to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. Some said he was too young. Bernanke liked him and he performed well in the 2009 crisis. (Translation: He was as honest as Bernanke and Jamie Dimon had hoped) The Bilderbergers will need Warsh and Bernanke as well to get a handle on those bank runs over in Europe which will come to America soon enough. His wife Jane is an heiress to the Estee Lauder family fortune. </p>
<p><b>Wolf</b>, Martin H    GB     Chief Economics Commentator, The Financial Times. He is the favorite writer of billionaires all over the world. He is a committed Globalist. As a young man, he worried about the economic conditions of the 1930s that created the war. He should read my essay below giving solutions other than more debts and more spending to solve our current crisis. </p>
<p><b>Wolfensohn</b>, James D.    USA      Chairman and CEO, Wolfensohn and Company. He is most famous for being the former head of the World Bank. He was a partner of Paul Volcker and made his mark in rescuing Chrysler back in 1980. He was an Australian lawyer working for an English bank when he decided to become an American citizen so he would be eligible to become World Bank President. His father worked for the Rothschilds before immigrating suddenly to Australia. </p>
<p><b>Wright</b>, Nigel S     Canada        Chief of Staff, Office of the Prime Minister. Wright was an executive with private equity firm Onex Corp., and dealt specifically with the aerospace industry. Onex manages capital for Hawker Beechcraft, a firm that has partnered on projects with F-35 manufacturer Lockheed Martin. (Huffington Post). The F-35 is an expensive plane that does not work and should not have been bought. Wright’s boss at Onex (Gerry Schwartz) is the husband of the woman (Heather Reisman) who owns Indigo Books and sits on the Bilderberg Steering Committee. She selects Canadians to attend Bilderberg. Her husband might have helped his former employee into the PM’s office. </p>
<p>PM Stephen Harper is a Zionist and every banker’s dream for a politician. I have distant relatives in Canada. If America collapsed, I would not go there. Things are deteriorating that rapidly up north. </p>
<p><b>Yergin</b>, Daniel     USA      Chairman, IHS Cambridge Energy Research Associates. He is a Harvard man who believes in peak oil. What he needs to do is to ask himself why he was invited into a room with so many billionaires and oil company executives. He ought to be demanding the release of that Tesla technology and all the improvements made over the last 70 years. Zoellick, Robert B.      USA          President, The World Bank Group. He is a lawyer and worked in the Reagan and Bush I Admins,  From 1993 to 1997 as an Executive VP of scandal plagued Fannie Mae. He signed the PNAC letter demanding America declare war on the whole world except Israel. He was also a managing director of Goldman Sachs.</p>

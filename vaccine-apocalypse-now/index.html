<p>“Compulsory vaccination which once had the suffrage of the nation has now hardly a serious supporter. We are ashamed to jettison the idea completely and perhaps afraid that if we did the accident of some future epidemic might put us in the wrong. We prefer to let compulsory vaccination die a natural death and are relieved that the general public is not curious enough to demand an inquest. In the meantime our attention is diverted to other and new forms of immunisations”  – [A] Charles Cyril Okell, “From a Bacteriological Back-Number,” <i>The Lancet</i>, January 1, 1938 pp 48-49</p>
<p>A Vaccine Apocalypse is in progress Now in America. This is a war, started centuries ago and continues today because Americans have no education in the history of vaccines or the nature of medical tyranny. </p>
<p><a name="more"></a>There is a war raging against American Citizens, an attack, hidden and packaged in a religion of pretended Authority, presented and sold by an immoral and synthetic, media manufactured, culture of self-sacrifice, guilt, pacifism, denial and learned helplessness. </p>
<p>The phony, plastic, unnatural culture is supported by pseudo-science, monopoly capitalism, false intellectualism and a growing expression of violence against those beginning to see behind the mask of this specious malevolent deception. </p>

<p>Vaccination hysteria and a crescendoing push to validate, normalize and implement vaccinations for growing numbers of disease is one expression of this multi-headed serpent gathering strength via usurpation of an individual’s rights, responsibilities and sovereign authority over their property including their bodies. </p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>
A 2012 study led by Dr. David Witt, an infectious disease specialist at the San Rafael, California Kaiser Permanente Medical Center, concluded that whooping cough, pertussis, occurs more among vaccinated children than children not vaccinated for pertussis with the DtaP vaccine that replaced the DTP vaccine.[B] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The entire tainted history of vaccines has been riddled with fraud and deception. Without a working knowledge of the medical tyranny festering in America and the Western World, including the real history of vaccines, Americans cannot defend themselves in this war, which has been raging since the early 1800s. </p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>
As a matter of fact, pertussis has been on the rise since pertussis vaccinations have increased. In 2010, a mumps outbreak occurred among 1000 children in upper New Jersey and lower New York. Almost 80% of them had been vaccinated with MMR (measles, mumps &amp; rubella) vaccine. [B] </p>

Opening their bodies to complete unknowns, trusting corporations with histories fraught with lies while, at the same time, opening their wallets to these companies and their enforcement arms in government just to placate and immunize themselves against further intrusion into their lives. </p>
<p>Doing the research and reading history it can be easily seen vaccines have never worked very well. They have always been associated with promoting and expressing the disease, called shedding, a process whereby the inoculated can and does manufacture the immunizing virus internally while the immune system is shocked and responding to the direct injection of attenuated virus (or in most cases, multiple viral strains, DNA and RNA). </p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

Throughout the 1980s, official agencies reported several outbreaks of measles occurring among children who had been vaccinated in various locations including an Illinois junior high and high school, a Massachusetts high school, a region in France, and a rural area near Helisinki, Finland. </p>

<p>The push to force these disease-causing, tainted with numerous co-toxins, vaccines on the American public is declaration of war by those seeking to downsize human populations, end the reign of sovereign states and to discredit and forever render powerless an individual’s right to privacy and controlled access to his or her body.</p>

<p>The vaccine mafia, supported by the thugs of medical malpractice, the factitious authority of the State and soon the end of a gun, are replaying a war they already lost long ago: Forced and defined mandatory vaccinations has been tried and then refuted in the past. </p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>
Perhaps the best reason to know our history is so that the worst parts are never repeated. – Dr. Suzanne Humphries, M.D. [A] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Today just like yesterday, the modern, for big profit, pharmaceutical cartels, supported by their priests and acolytes, are pushing a self-contradictory idea that vaccinated people are getting diseases anyway because they are in the company of non-vaccinated people. </p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>
Sir Duminie Corigan, M.D. when acting as one of the the committee in 1871, on the Vaccination Act [In England ], said: “An unvaccinated child is like a bag of gunpowder which might blow up the whole school, and ought not, therefore, to be admitted to a school unless he is vaccinated” – [A] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, it was during a major outbreak of smallpox in the 1880s and 1890s that some enlightened, and apparently not bought off, officials in the City of Leicester, England, a city and unitary authority area in the East Midlands of England, after reviewing the history and data concerning vaccinations and noting increases in the number of people infected with smallpox seemed correlated with vaccination, decided to go against the church of medicine and ban vaccinations for all those in the city. </p>
<p>Then just as now: </p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>
Concerns over vaccine safety, effectiveness, and governmental infringement on personal liberty and freedom through compulsory vaccination stoked the fires of the anti-vaccination movement. People began to resist the government and chose to pay fines. Some even accepted imprisonment rather than allowing vaccinations for themselves of their children. The public backlash culminated in the Great Demonstration in Leicester, England in 1885. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>
That same year, Leicester’s government, which had pushed for vaccination through the use of fines and jail time, was replaced with a new government that was opposed to compulsory vaccination. By 1887 the vaccination coverage rates had dropped to 10 percent. [A] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The so-called Leicester method relied on quarantine of smallpox patients and disinfection of homes. The city believed this method was inexpensive and effective means to eliminate vaccinations. </p>
<p>According to an article in the <i>The Times</i>, March 24, 1885: </p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>
The last decade has witnessed an extraordinary decrease in vaccinations, but, nevertheless, the town has enjoyed an almost entire immunity from the small-pox… </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>
The result is that in every instance the disease has been promptly and completely stamped out at paltry expense. Under such a system the Corporation have expressed their opinion that vaccination is unnecessary, as they claim to deal with disease in a more direct and much more efficacious manner. This and a widespread belief that death and disease have resulted from the operation of vaccination.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stunningly, the success of the Leicester method was not seen in towns and cities that forced citizens to vaccinate. </p>

Not only may well-vaccinated towns be affected with small-pox, but the most thorough vaccination of a population that is possible to imagine may be followed by and extensive outbreak of the disease. This happened in the mining and agricultural district of Mold, in Flintshire… Leicester, with population under ten of age practically unvaccinated , had a small-pox death rate 144 per million; whereas Mold, with all of the births vaccinated for eighteen years previous to the epidemic, had one of 3614 per million [A] </p>

The upside also includes a not spoken about benefit – vaccinated people are likely to develop chronic life-long problems associated with immune disorders and disease caused by the compounds of vaccines. Damaged vaccine recipients become a continual source of patients supplied to the conventional medical system still treating people with disease-causing medicine, unnecessary surgery and long-term hospitalization and nursing home care for older people suffering from disease caused originally by vaccination years earlier. </p>

As disclosed at VaccineInjury.info, vaccinated children are nearly twice as likely as unvaccinated children to develop neurodermatitis, for instance, a skin disorder marked by chronic itching and scratching. Similarly, vaccinated children are about two-and-a-half times as likely, based on current data, to develop a pattern of migraine headaches compared to unvaccinated children. [C] </p>

<p>Recently Dr. William Thompson Senior Scientist with the Centers for Disease Control <a href="https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2014/08/22/cdc-whistleblower-revealed-william-thompson/">publicly admitted</a>, in August 2014, the CDC covered up data linking the MMR vaccine to Autism in 1998 — and yet nothing has been done about this ongoing tragedy that apparently will never end. </p>
<p>In fact, the mainstream scripted news outlets, such as FOX, CNN, MSNBC and disinformation sites like snopes.com are claiming William Thompson’s revelations are a hoax – yet Doctor Andrew Wakefield had already shown a correlation between vaccines in an article published in <i>The Lancet Medical Journal</i> in 1998, meanwhile children are still be forced to suffer the MMR vaccine and Autism rates are still climbing.

<p>Vaccines are a money making super-scam being foisted on humans in the name of doing good. Doing good in this case may even require the point of a gun or the threat of losing your children or long jail terms. </p>
<p>Vaccines themselves are an open door to your body, a direct entrance past the firewall of your skin and immune system, capable of causing or creating any imaginable malady in your body, whether at the moment of injection or, via a timed mechanism, causing long-term health problems after any number of years. </p>
<p>Vaccines are a pig-in-the-poke which neither you, nor your medicine man (Doctor), has any clue about contents of these liquid unknowns. </p>

New evidence, shown in link just below, presents even more convincing and damning revelations the CDC, FDA, NIH, Planned Parenthood and likely other United Nations cover operations are purposefully maiming and killing our children. The article entitled “Finally the Truth: Study Links Autism to Vaccines of ‘Aborted Babies’ Cells”, announces a study showing “increases in Autism rates directly linked to the introduction of vaccines manufactured using human fetal cells from aborted babies.” The study, published in the September 2014 in the <i>Journal of Public Health and Epidemiology</i>, “was designed to analyze whether or not the environment factor of fetal cells could be connected with the rise in Autism.” (<a href="http://patriotupdate.com/articles/finally-truth-study-links-autism-vaccines-aborted-babies-cells/">Source</a>) </p>

<p>According to the study “Researchers identified three specific change points in the U.S. between 1970 and 2002 following the approval in 1979 of the MMR II and Varivax Chickenpox vaccines, which used the fetal cell line WI-38, instead of animal-based cells. The Late 1980 study by the EPA confirmed one of the change points in which the incidence of Autism rose significantly in the U.S. as well as points in other countries. Each of these points corresponds to the times that a vaccine containing DNA from aborted babies was added to the recommended vaccine schedule.”  IBID </p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>Worse yet “Not only are the human fetal contaminated vaccines associated with autistic disorder throughout the World but also with epidemic childhood leukemia and lymphomas.”  IBID </p>
<p>With more and more babies being aborted, the irony of rising Autism rates, rising in direct proportion to “the increasing numbers of human fetal manufactured vaccines which have been added to the US immunization guidelines”, should be interpreted as a wake up call to those thinking nature will not push back against anti-life activities. </p>
<p>A bigger and more primary issue in this discussion of forced, mandated, and “required to work” vaccinations is this: where comes the “Authority” to violate the body of an individual without permission, by force or threat of job loss or jail ? By what moral authority or life natural authority can costumed pretend authorities violate a person’s most intimate and private possession, his/her body? </p>

<p>Vaccines are, at the best, a last resort method in the face of some out-of-control infectious contagion, but should never be considered for normal childhood disease such as the measles and mumps and rubella (measles). Typically measles results in the death of 1 or 2 children per 1000 cases and of those deaths, most result from pneumonia not the measles. The risk of vaccine related long term damage, or Autism, now 1 out 50 children, is just not worth the risk. </p>
<p>Compare these death rates to the rate of Autism, now 1 in 50 or consider that hospitals kill over 700,000 per year by mistake. (<a href="http://www.lef.org/magazine/2004/3/awsi_death/Page-02">Source</a>)</p>
<p>Or consider that Medical Doctor Mistakes are the 3rd leading cause of death in the United States. (<a href="http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2000/07/30/doctors-death-part-one.aspx">Source</a>) </p>

Edward Jenner (1796-1839) “discovered” that cowpox vaccine would supposedly innoculate persons against the eighteenth century scourge of smallpox. In fact, smallpox was already on the wane, and some authorities believe it would have vanished by the end of the century, due to a number of contributing factors. After the use of cowpox vaccine became widespread in England, a smallpox epidemic broke in which killed 22,081 people. The smallpox epidemic became worse each year that the vaccine was used. In 1872, 44,480 people were killed by it. England finally banned the vaccine in 1948, despite the fact that it was one of the most widely heralded “contribution” which that country had made to modern medicine. This action came after many years of compulsory vaccination, during which period those who refused to submit to its dangers were hurried off to jail.[E] page 136-137 </p>

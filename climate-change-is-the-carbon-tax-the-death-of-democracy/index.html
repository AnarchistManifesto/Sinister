<b><a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2012/08/climate-change-is-carbon-tax-death-of.html">Activist Post</a></b></p>
<p>On July 1st 2012, Australia joined nations around the world in their move towards a carbon economy through the implementation of a Carbon Tax, which will become an Emissions Trading Scheme in 2015. Yet the underpinning justification for this move, the science behind man-made global warming, is not even close to being settled. In fact, an increasingly large body of scientists and researchers are telling us the exact opposite of what the United Nations and governments around the world would have us believe.</p>
<p>It is now evident that the science behind man-made global warming that dictates government policy is false, manipulated and corrupt and exists solely to meet a pre-determined political agenda whilst attempting to pass it off as credible science.</p>
<p>Central to this article is the role of the United Nations. Their treaties, summits and bodies have been responsible for providing the framework and political will that has moved the ‘environmental movement’ to where it is today.</p>
<p>This article seeks to go into more depth into current day science, which overwhelmingly suggests that global warming is not caused by human Carbon Dioxide emissions. Furthermore, I will outline the role of key players on the international stage that have worked tirelessly to convince us otherwise.</p>
<p>Finally, I will begin to look in more depth at what the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) is and where it actually originated. As the article progresses it will become clearer that the Carbon Tax and Emissions Trading Scheme do absolutely nothing for the environment. Given this is the pretext used by governments for introducing carbon economy, I will attempt to convey some deeper social, political and economic influences at work here. In doing so, I hope to assist in understanding the reasons why we are moving towards a carbon economy and how this global movement abolishes our inalienable rights as human beings and basic freedoms – most of which many of us take for granted.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><b>The United Nation Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change (UNIPCC)</b></p>
<p>According to the UN IPCC’s website “The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is the leading international body for the assessment of climate change. It was established by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) to provide the world with a clear scientific view on the current state of knowledge in climate change and its potential environmental and socio-economic impacts.”</p>
<div align="center">
</div>
<p>
The UN IPCC’s findings are directly responsible for government policy being implemented around the world and this is carried out through <a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/publications_and_data_reports.shtml">four assessment reports</a> produced in 1990, 1995, 2001 and 2007. There are currently 192 countries signed up to the <a href="http://unfccc.int/essential_background/items/6031.php">United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)</a> – an important international framework that commits governments to tackle climate change through a reduction of Carbon Dioxide Emissions. There are 194 recognised countries in the world.</p>
<p>Despite its global dominance, overwhelming evidence suggests that these powerful assessment reports that dictate policy and are directly responsible for the introduction of the Carbon Tax are false and full of misinformation. How is it that such a powerful tool as the United Nations with immense influence over world governments was able to progress so far in an agenda that was based on lies?</p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p><b>Key Players</b></p>
<p>One name that constantly comes up in regards to the global ‘environmental movement’ (Climate Change Industry) is <a href="http://www.quadrant.org.au/blogs/doomed-planet/2010/01/discovering-maurice-strong">Maurice Strong</a>. Strong has been driving the climate change bandwagon since its origins back in the ’70s. Having made his fortune in oil, Maurice became very involved with the United Nations and headed many programs and summits on climate change. Maurice Strong fled to China in 2006 after being implicated in a million dollar bribe to himself involving the Oil for Food Program. He has been there ever since and is still very active in the ‘environmental movement’ and Chinese politics.</p>
<p>To further understand how we got ourselves to where we are today, we have to understand where the myth of man-made global warming really gained traction. Al Gore’s book and ‘documentary’ – <i>An Inconvenient Truth</i> – was a hit worldwide, it even received not one but two Oscars! Reminds me of when Obama won the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize – what a joke! Al Gore’s <i>An Inconvenient Truth</i>, was highly successful in instilling fear around the world that imminent climate cataclysmic events would soon follow all because of human-produced Carbon Dioxide. The documentary spread like wildfire and found its way into classrooms across America. The fate of humanity was sealed; disaster would fall upon us and entire cities would be under water, unless we acted now. </p>
<p>So what else do these two powerful men have in common besides being strong proponents behind the ‘environmental movement’? It’s called <a href="http://www.canadafreepress.com/index.php/article/9629">The Chicago Climate Exchange</a>, and it is North America’s sole carbon exchange centre (think stock market). Yes, that’s right, these men are raking in massive profits from the global Emissions Trading Scheme. Conflict of interest? I think so! The same men that sold us the myth of man-made global warming are the same men that sold us the ‘solution’ of a Carbon Tax and Emissions Trading Scheme and now they’re profiting off their lucrative investments which are based on lies.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Vincent Gray senior climate skeptic and UN IPCC expert reviewer</b></p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/teslasecret/" style="float: right;margin-left: 1em;margin-top: -1em"><img alt="" class="noshadow" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/_qLAIskTQXUc/TaqAcrCPlhI/AAAAAAAAISQ/5uq527jnmDM/book-shape.jpg" style="border: none" width="150"></a>Dr. Vincent Gray is an internationally eminent retired scientist with a Phd in Chemistry from Cambridge, who enjoyed a long career as a coal industry researcher before spending the last 22 years of his life in climate science. He lives off his pension and receives no funding for his climate research work, hence his interest in the climate debate is not influenced by any financial ties or interests.</p>
<p>He has published hundreds of scientific papers spanning many topics with several on climate appearing in peer-reviewed publications. But due to the institutional corruption and politicisation surrounding the Climate Change debate, much of his work is censored. He also authored two books; <i>The Climate Change Delusion</i> and <i>Confessions of a Climate Skeptic</i>.</p>
<p>Dr Vincent Gray is an <a href="http://www.conscious.com.au/__documents/gray%20documents/Chapter%209%20UN%20IPCC%20WG1%20AR4%20Vincent%20Gray.pdf">expert reviewer of all four UN IPCC</a> assessment reports and is responsible for thousands of comments on the reports – most of which were ignored. The blatant disregard of contrary scientific findings by the UN IPCC conveys the UN IPCC political agenda at the expense of the science. Dr Vincent Gray’s comments were not peer-reviewed; an essential method used in the science world to ensure consensus and accurate scientific findings.</p>
<p>In an interview with Dr. Vincent Gray, I asked him about the UN IPCC’s credibility and track record.</p>
<p>“The 1992 Rio Conference endorsed a legally binding definition of ‘Climate Change’  that the climate is largely controlled by human-produced trace gases.”</p>
<p>“They wished to show that the globe is warming, but this cannot be done as it is impossible to measure the average temperature of the earth.”</p>
<p>I delved further, questioning the system that governs the Climate Change Industry where Dr Vincent provided some further interesting insight.</p>
<p>“The whole system is supported, supervised and financed by the governments who signed the Framework Convention on Climate Change.”</p>
<p>“They intimidated editors of scientific journals to control the ‘peer review’ process in their favour.”</p>
<p>“They took control of many university departments, National science organisations and media outlets.”</p>
<p>“People who tell the truth are intimidated.”</p>
<p>Dr Vincent’s comments on the UN IPCC reports conveys the inherent institutional corruption that occurred, which allowed inaccurate science of ‘man-made global warming’ to infiltrate society’s perceptions, thus forming the foundation of government policy.</p>

<b>Science – The Facts</b></p>
<p>The next section of this article will be concerned with the science underpinning man-made global warming, specifically human Carbon Dioxide emissions and whether or not humans are responsible for a rise in temperatures, Global Warming and/or Climate Change. This key point is at the heart of the entire debate because it is on this false and misleading science that a global re-structuring of the economy, politics and society as we know it is occurring. So if the science that justifies the Carbon Tax, Emissions Trading Scheme and other massive global transformations are in fact based on lies, wouldn’t you like to know?</p>
<p>Firstly, the world hasn’t actually been warming since 1998, it’s been cooling. This explains why ‘Global Warming’ has been re-branded as ‘Climate Change’. UN IPCC’s underpinning science purports that a rise in man-made Carbon Dioxide emissions is responsible for a rise in temperature, but this simply isn’t true. It is the other way around. It is temperatures that dictate Carbon Dioxide levels. <a href="http://drtimball.com/">Dr. Tim Ball</a> a prominent speaker on Climate change and climate skeptic outlines this in a <a href="http://podcasts.mrn.com.au.s3.amazonaws.com/alanjones/20110527-aj2-timothyball.mp3">radio interview with Alan Jones</a>.</p>
<p>UN IPCC temperature data, from which their conclusions on man-made global warming are drawn, is fundamentally flawed for several reasons. The data is taken from weather stations around the world and then assembled into computer models which frame our understanding of Global Warming today. Yet in 1990, when over 6000 weather stations worldwide were being used, three quarters dropped out which left a clear bias towards warmer temperature recordings from the remaining active weather stations. This suggests that the recent warming that we know of is connected to the methods of recording and not an actual increase in temperature. More details about how this crucial data is flawed can be found within this report from <a href="http://scienceandpublicpolicy.org/images/stories/papers/originals/surface_temp.pdf"><i>Science and Public Policy</i>.</a></p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/stirlinggenerator.html" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img border="0" src="https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/ad2.gif" width="200"></a>Dr. Vincent Courtillot, Professor of Geophysics at University Paris Diderot formed a research group with other established scientists from around Europe to determine the cause of temperature fluctuation. After requesting UN IPCC’s data that forms their theory of man-made Global Warming, he was denied, therefore he and his group had to re-collate the data independently. His research found that temperature change is determined solely by Solar activity. Yes, that’s right the sun dictates temperature, not Carbon Dioxide levels of which humans have a minuscule influence compared to what is produced naturally by nature. Their scientific findings are well documented and can be viewed <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG_7zK8ODGA">here. </a></p>
<p>And what about the global rise in sea levels devastating coastal cities around the world? Well science around the world shows no change in Global Sea levels, with Tidal Gauge stations recording an average of 18cm Global Sea Level Rise every century with no variation recorded during increased temperatures. That’s 1.8mm a year. This information can be viewed from a joint report by the <a href="http://www.nipccreport.org/reports/2009/pdf/CCR2009FullReport.pdf">Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change</a> – A consortium of independent scientists established to analyse published and peer-reviewed literature available on global warming from around the world producing a report that directly responds to the UN IPCC’s reports. Another excellent research paper on sea level rise around the world can be viewed <a href="http://www.galileomovement.com.au/docs/EvidenceForNoSeaLevelChange.pdf">here.</a></p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>A group of 1000 international Scientists who dissent and disagree with man-made global warming speak out in the <a href="http://ec.libsyn.com/p/b/f/6/bf663fd2376ffeca/2010_Senate_Minority_Report.pdf?d13a76d516d9dec20c3d276ce028ed5089ab1ce3dae902ea1d01cc8632d2cf5e5134&amp;c_id=2869473">Climate Depot Report</a>. One scientist, Dr. Leonard Weinstein who worked 35 years at the NASA Langley Research Center said: “Any reasonable scientific analysis must conclude the basic theory wrong!!”</p>
<p>The information is available for anyone to read. We have been lied to. Global Warming is a scam. But why has the United Nations gone to such great lengths to have us believe otherwise? Is an Emissions Trading Scheme so important? Or is there something else going on?</p>
<p><b>The Carbon Tax and Emissions Trading Scheme</b></p>
<p>The initial step of the Carbon Tax in the move towards a Carbon Economy is underway. If left unchallenged, the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) will be introduced in 2015, paving the way for the new Global Carbon Economy. This integrated global economic system is based on trading and control of carbon emissions. This is how it works; companies are designated with an amount of carbon credits in line with the government’s cap of carbon emissions that they’re allowed to emit. Companies that emit less are left with carbon credits which can be sold for a profit. Alternatively, if they use all their credits they purchase more carbon credits from companies around the world on the carbon exchange market. The idea is to give an economic incentive to polluters to reduce their carbon footprint. As the world moves closer to their goal of reducing emissions as outlined at the <a href="http://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol/items/2830.php/">United Nations Kyoto protocol,</a> we are told that we are helping the environment by limiting pollution. But again, the incentive for polluters only occurs if it is profitable. There is much criticism about the effectiveness of this system where it is currently implemented in Europe and has nothing short of failed. Fraud and corruption are rife and emissions have not yet been reduced – and even if they were it wouldn’t actually have any effect on the climate change anyway!</p>
<p>Eventually the Emissions Trading Scheme and carbon credits will be transferred to individuals in the form of a <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2006/dec/11/uk.greenpolitics">carbon card</a>, much like a credit card we use today only it is for our energy consumption. Individuals will be designated with an annual carbon allowance to meet their energy, fuel and travel needs. The concept remains the same as the Emissions Trading Scheme, only the individual is designated carbon credits to be exchanged on the Carbon Stock Exchange markets. <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2006/dec/11/uk.greenpolitics">Plans in the UK for the carbon trading credit cards</a> are well underway and will follow around the world soon enough. As nations attempt to meet their emission reduction goals, individual carbon allowances will also be capped and decrease over time.</p>
<p>This system of carbon trading and carbon economy is in the hands of the <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aXRBOxU5KT5M">major banks</a> such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan. Personally, I don’t feel too good about handing over the reins of control of many aspects of my life to be regulated by banks and governments. How do you feel about that?</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/privacywar.html" style="float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-_VDc_KgLmQQ/T7wqeoC8OeI/AAAAAAAAO6c/4ajNJleuzIQ/s270/170_animated.gif"></a><b>Social Transformation</b></p>
<p>As we slowly move into a carbon currency, we replace our current price-based system with one that deals with energy, which will essentially lead to a cashless society. We are already seeing this happening voluntarily around the world. As people increasingly start to use their credit cards for all their transactions, money in circulation will eventually be replaced with purely electronic transactions and energy allowances or individual carbon credits. This was on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBQ0YpVk0UM&amp;feature=g-u-u">Bilderberg 2012′s Agenda</a> with the move towards <a href="http://calvaryadvisor.org/2.html">electronic I.D. cards</a> already happening – an essential step towards a cashless society. Every detail about us is recorded on these cards through microchip technology. But, keep in mind, individuals in a cashless society hand over all their rights to the governments and banks that control the system.</p>
<p>Another worrying aspect of the ‘environmental movement’ in the name of ‘saving the planet’ is the United Nations’ <a href="http://www.freedomsphoenix.com/News/101297-2011-12-13-agenda-21-ends-your-property-rights.htm">Agenda 21 for Sustainable Development</a>, adopted by more than 178 governments around the world at the United Nations Rio Earth Summit in 1992. Agenda 21 is a detailed global action plan already adopted and being implemented by governments around the world which openly calls for population reduction, abolition of property rights and a complete re-structuring of populations around the world into high-volume smart cities. This is not a joke; it is a United Nations international treaty and a working document that governments are already implementing on both national and local level. I will dedicate an entire article to this issue in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>But probably of most interest about the Emissions Trading Scheme and the move towards a <a href="http://www.augustforecast.com/2010/01/26/carbon-currency-a-new-beginning-for-technocracy/">carbon economy</a> is its startling parallels with <a href="http://www.canadafreepress.com/index.php/article/19380">Technocracy</a>. Technocracy is a social movement and alternative political system that gained quite a bit of traction in the US in the 1930s during the Great Depression. It is a social, economic and political system based on individual’s energy consumption and is controlled wholly by experts and scientists – not elected leaders like the system we live in today. Instead of people being rewarded with money for their work, they would be given energy allowances. One key aspect of Technocracy is the <a href="http://www.technocracy.org/transition/energy-distribution-card/118-energy-distribution-card">Energy Distribution Card</a>. Sound familiar? Well it should, the idea is being rolled out around the world now all in the name of fighting man-made Global Warming, yet the idea originated long before man-made global warming even existed. Are we moving towards a Technocratic society?</p>
<p>Central to Technocracy is a system that allows for the measurement of energy consumption of both individuals and households. The political system cannot be implemented otherwise. This may sound familiar to some of you as the <a href="http://www.augustforecast.com/2010/03/03/smart-grid-the-implementation-of-technocracy-2/">Smart Grid and Smart Meters</a> currently being rolled out around the world. This technology is being hooked up to households around the world and infrastructure is being designed that will allow Smart Grids to be integrated into a much larger global system of measuring energy production and consumption.</p>
<p>A brilliant question has been posed by <a href="http://www.newswithviews.com/NWV-News/news273.htm">Patrick Wood</a>: “Who is orchestrating this?”</p>
<p>So now what?</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/foodcrisis.html" style="float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-AZzgc806w9s/TtEamGAkBbI/AAAAAAAAM2Y/GN5ff31ySP4/s200/imgad.jpg"></a>All of the ‘solutions’ I have outlined in this article are being sold to the world via media and education in the name of ‘saving the environment’. But the very same entities responsible for creating the ‘solutions’ are the ones responsible for the problem to begin with and pose a serious threat towards truly sustainable solutions. The state of technology and resources existing today to transform our society towards a truly sustainable global community are infinite. All that stands in our way are the political, economic and social systems currently in place. But we must remember that they only exist because we allow them too.</p>
<p>One way or another a fundamental transformation of our global society is underway. The only question we need ask ourselves is do we want to be a part of the alternative and co-create a sustainable global community together? Or do we want to let the bankers, politicians and technocrats do it for us under the guise of ‘sustainability’ whilst moving towards a world where all aspects of our lives are governed and controlled. Freedom as we know it will no longer exist, and along with our freedom will go the mechanisms that are now available to us to protect it.</p>
<p>Things are moving fast, faster than we can comprehend. It’s time to make your choice. By doing nothing, you are complicit to their plan. By remaining indifferent you allow this repressive and controlling global system to be built right in front of your very eyes. But by saying no, educating yourself and beginning to actively participate in opposing this system you make room for the new fair, equal and just paradigm. A world to be built by the collective, by all of us. An alternative system that we can all be proud to call our own. We don’t have much time left; we must act and we must act now.</p>

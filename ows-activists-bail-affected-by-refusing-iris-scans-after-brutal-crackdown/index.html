<a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2012/03/ows-activists-bail-affected-by-refusing.html"><b>Activist Post</b></a></p>
<p>I have spent a great deal of time <a href="http://endthelie.com/2011/09/30/nowhere-to-run-drones-facial-recognition-soft-biometrics-and-threat-assessments/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">covering biometrics</a> and how <a href="http://endthelie.com/2011/11/11/foia-lawsuit-reveals-fbi-collecting-biometric-information-for-massive-interagency-database/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">this information is centralized in a federal database</a> which can be shared with other agencies and even international “partners” as well.</p>
<p>Over recent years, there has been a clear and concerted effort to<a href="http://endthelie.com/2011/10/09/the-invisible-surveillance-state-dhs-and-the-end-of-america-as-we-know-it/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"> increase the amount of biometric information collected on American citizens</a>,  along with a rise in the force (direct and indirect) of the tactics  leveraged by government agencies in their quest to obtain biometric  information.</p>
<p>This was evidenced most recently by a disturbing, and likely illegal,  tactic used against Occupy Wall Street protesters after they were arrested in one of <a href="http://motherjones.com/mojo/2012/03/watch-police-get-violent-ows-retakes-zuccotti-park" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">the most brutal police actions</a> we’ve seen in quite a time.</p>
<p>Indeed the arrests were so out of hand, a member of the New York City Council <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/council-member-nypd-brutal-in-arresting-ows-201/2012/03/19/gIQA0ZM6NS_video.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">actually used</a>  the word “brutal” in describing the atrocious response. Members of the  press were also allegedly harassed, attacked and otherwise prevented  from doing their job <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/03/18/1075512/-Compilation-of-Tweets-from-Journalists-Beaten-Obstructed-by-NYPD-in-Zuccotti-Raid" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">according to many of their statements on Twitter</a>.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>One of the most disturbing incidents can be seen below when a young  woman actually had a seizure at which point police carried her by her  head and she had to wait a considerable amount of time (17 minutes  according to some reports) before professional medical help arrived and  protesters outside of the barricades reportedly had to call 911 to get  the EMT to come.</p>

<p>
This situation gets even more troublesome when we consider the statements of Ryan Devereaux on Democracy Now.</p>
<p>“Attorneys with the National Lawyers Guild are particularly concerned  because, despite repeated efforts, they haven’t been able to speak to  her,” Devereaux said.</p>
<p>“These attorneys have told me that in most cases, it would be easy  for them to speak to a potential client, to speak to someone who is—you  know, who’s in police custody but has been hospitalized. But those  efforts have been stopped. It’s unclear exactly why,” he added.</p>
<p>If you want to know more about this situation, I encourage you to check out <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2012/3/19/police_arrest_73_in_occupy_wall#.T2dXGxp7pag.twitter" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">this link</a>,  but keep in mind that it involves Michael Moore and I do not, by any  means, consider Democracy Now to be an unbiased and uncompromised source  of information. I recommend taking it with a grain of salt, although  that’s my point of view when it comes to any and all news sources.</p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>The situation for these activists got even worse during arraignment in Manhattan Criminal Court. While most of these protesters were charged with very minor crimes, they were soon to find out that they could not be released on their own recognizance (or ROR in courtroom jargon) if they did not agree to have their irises photographed by police.</p>
<p>Activists and their volunteer legal advisors discovered that the size  of their bail was actually being swayed by their willingness to have  their irises photographed and input into a database.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2012/03/as_occupy_arres.php" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Runnin’ Scared</a>, a blog  with the Village Voice, photographing of irises by police and courts,  at both the time of arrest and at arraignment, in the United States  dates back to 2010. Nick Pinto, writing for the blog, claims that it was  due to multiple instances of a mistaken identity wherein an individual  facing quite serious charges was allowed to go free by impersonating an  individual facing relatively minor charges.</p>
<p>However, I see this as part of a greater trend of increasing the  amount of highly personal biometric information which is collected from  the people of the United States, all to be put in centralized databases  indefinitely.</p>
<p>Of course, there is also the major problem that, apparently, people have their irises photographed at the time of arrest <i>and</i>  arraignment, meaning that even if they drop some frivolous charge after  arresting you and let you go free with no charges filed, they still  have your iris scan on file.</p>
<p>This is actually not the first time these problems have cropped up in the news. Indeed, in February of this year, the<i> </i><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/13/nyregion/new-objections-to-nypds-iris-photographing-program.html?_r=1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">New York Times reported</a> on a 32-year-old woman who was arrested at an Occupy Wall Street demonstration in December.</p>
<p>This individual, named Samantha Wilson, said that she was threatened  by an officer after she refused to have her irises photographed.</p>
<p>“He said: ‘It’s not really optional. It’ll take you longer to get out  of here if you don’t do it,’” she said when recalling the officer’s  threat. Rebecca Heinegg, Wilson’s lawyer, says that she was held for  longer than usual due to her refusal to have her irises photographed and  put in a database.</p>
<p>This program is supposedly mandatory, and obviously police pressure  suspects into agreeing to the practice by holding them longer and even  manipulating the amount of money they have to pay for bail.</p>
<p>This is not only happening to individuals arrested for activities linked to Occupy Wall Street. Indeed, when a defense lawyer  for an individual charged with marijuana possession told Judge Abraham  Clott that she believed that her client was not legally bound to agree  to have their irises photographed, she discovered that the court did not  see it that way.</p>
<p>Judge Clott said that while the process of having irises photographed  and placed in a database might be optional in that the court can  technically go forward with proceedings without the photographs if the equipment used to take the pictures breaks or some such other factor arises, they are not, in fact, optional for the defendant.</p>
<p>Judge Clott is apparently not alone in his radical interpretation, as  revealed by the president of New York City’s National Lawyers Guild,  Gideon Oliver.</p>
<p>Oliver alleges that a memo, likely from the Office of Court  Administration, has been given to judges, telling them that the iris  photographs are actually mandatory.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/privacy-crisis.html" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_qLAIskTQXUc/TW6zd_MzhbI/AAAAAAAAHPE/DBvoPT_wz5M/pc150x225.gif"></a>Runnin’ Scared quotes Moira Meltzer-Cohen, a third-year law student  who assists in running Occupy Wall Street’s bail services, who said, “In  New York, bail can only legally be set for a single purpose: to ensure  that defendants appear at their next hearing.”</p>
<p>However, I’m not one to take the word of one person (especially  someone who is not yet an actual lawyer) as gospel, so I did some  digging myself and found the actual New York Criminal Procedure that is relevant to this issue.</p>
<p>This is Article 510 – § 510.30 Application for Recognizance or Bail;  Rules of Law and Criteria Controlling Determination in the New York Criminal Procedure.</p>
<p>
If you read the following (the entirety of which is <a href="http://law.onecle.com/new-york/criminal-procedure/CPL0510.30_510.30.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>), you will see that the refusal to have one’s irises photographed cannot, in any way, affect bail according to New York Criminal Procedure.</p>
<p><b>§  510.30  Application for recognizance or bail;  rules of law and criteria controlling determination.</b></p>
<blockquote>
<p>[…]<br />
2.    To the extent that the issuance of an order of recognizance or  bail and the terms thereof are matters of discretion rather than of law,  an application is determined on the basis of the following factors and  criteria: </p>

<p>(a)    With respect to any principal, the court must consider the  kind and degree of control or restriction that is necessary to secure  his court attendance when required.  In determining that matter, the  court must, on the basis of available information, consider and take  into account: </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(i)     The principal’s character, reputation, habits and mental condition;<br />
(ii)  His employment and financial resources; and<br />
(iii)  His family ties and the length of his residence if any in the community; and<br />
(iv)  His criminal record if any; and<br />
(v)   His record of previous adjudication as a juvenile delinquent,  as retained pursuant to section 354.2 of  the  family  court  act,  or,   of pending  cases where fingerprints are retained pursuant to section  306.1 of such act, or a youthful offender, if any; and<br />
(vi)  His previous record if any in responding to court appearances  when required or with respect to flight to avoid criminal prosecution;  and<br />
(vii)  If he is a defendant, the weight of the evidence against him  in the pending criminal action and any other factor indicating   probability or improbability  of  conviction; or, in the case of an  application for bail or recognizance pending appeal, the merit or lack  of merit  of  the appeal; and<br />
(viii)    If he is a defendant, the sentence which may be or has been imposed upon conviction. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(b)  Where the principal is a defendant-appellant in a pending   appeal from  a  judgment  of  conviction,  the  court  must  also   consider the likelihood of ultimate reversal of the judgment.   A  determination  that the  appeal  is  palpably  without  merit  alone  justifies, but does not require, a denial of the application, regardless   of  any  determination made with respect to the factors specified in  paragraph (a).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Clearly, there is no mention of such a thing as refusing an iris scan  being able to influence bail, and this judge is simply following a  memorandum instead of the law.</p>
<p>In the case of an activist with Occupy Wall Street who was recently  arraigned, all of the above factors would indicate that she would be  released on her own recognizance.</p>
<p>Her parents were actually sitting in the courtroom at the time of  arraignment, she held a job, and most importantly it was her first time  dealing with the justice system.</p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>She was initially charged with resisting arrest and attempted  robbery. The prosecutor later dropped the attempted robbery charge with  the prosecutor acknowledged that the arresting officer claimed that the  defendant grabbed at his badge while the officer still affirmed that he  never believed she was actually trying to steal the badge.</p>

<p>Even considering all of the above factors, the prosecutor requested  $1,000 bail because the individual refused to have her iris  photographed, to which Judge Clott (unsurprisingly) agreed.</p>
<p>“Even though all of the legitimate bail factors militate against  setting bail, he did it anyway,” Meltzer-Cohen stated. “Bail is not  supposed to be used in any kind of punitive way. He’s using his  discretion as a judge to enforce a non-enforceable practice.”</p>
<p>Others who were arrested for their activities related to the Occupy  Wall Street demonstration also had their refusal to have their irises  photographed brought up as justification for bail, although they were  able to post the bail and be released.</p>
<p>Oliver said that another client – who assumedly is related to Occupy  Wall Street, although that is not made explicit – is being targeted for  his refusal to bow down and have his biometric information recorded.</p>
<p>Police are now refusing to produce him in court for his arraignment  until he agrees to have his irises photographed, according to Oliver. He  even said that he would file a writ of habeas corpus if they did not  produce him in court soon.</p>
<p>“It may well come to that [today],” Oliver said. “If this had come up earlier, I might be doing that now.”</p>
<p>Clearly, the criminal procedure in New York State does not allow for  refusal to hand over biometric information to be used as a factor in  considering bail, but unfortunately the judges have apparently given up  on that entirely.</p>
<p>Hopefully bringing attention to this disturbing practice and the  complete illegality of it will bring some heat and push them to stop it,  but unfortunately when judges and prosecutors are working together  against the people they are supposed to serve, no good can be expected  to come from it.</p>

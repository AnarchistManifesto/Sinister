<div class="MsoNormal">Even as the mainstream media and a television-obsessed American public refuse to admit the existence of chemtrails and government-sponsored weather modification programs, the evidence continues to mount with ever-increasing speed that not only do these programs exist, but they are also effective and widespread. </div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="background-color: transparent;font-family: times new roman,new york,times,serif;font-size: 16px;font-style: normal">
</div>
<p>In addition to the recent study published in Environmental Research Letters entitled, “<a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/7/3/034019/article">Cost Analysis of Stratospheric Albedo Modification Delivery Systems</a>,” where the costs of delivering tonnes of aerosols into the stratosphere were examined in terms of a variety of different means, a 2010 study undertaken on behalf of the Belfort Group, a Belgian “environmental watchdog” organization, also corroborates much of the information compiled by citizens and activists the world over regarding the existence of chemtrails and stratospheric weather modification programs.</p>
<p>The study, entitled, “<a href="http://www.belfort-group.eu/sites/default/files/page/2010/05/COpart1.pdf" target="_blank">Contrail Science, Its Impact On Climate and Weather Manipulation Programs Conducted By The United States And Its Allies</a>,” seeks to highlight “the specific problems associated with contrails emitted by aircraft, the manipulation for defense purposes of some of these trails by the United States government and the subsequent effect on quality of life.”</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>Making a distinction between four different types of man-made “clouds” – contrails, chemtrails, distrails (the tunnel produced when a plane passes through a stable cloud), and wingtip vortices (the vortex caused by planes flying at high speed) – the study focuses on contrails and chemtrails.</p>
<p>Thus, the report defines chemtrails by stating,</p>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 10.0pt;margin-left: .5in;margin-right: .5in;margin-top: 0in">Chemtrail is the contraction of ‘chemical trail’ and is used by some sources to denote intentional spraying by airplanes for military or political purposes and that may be harmful to public health. A more general name is ‘aviation smog,’ which combines contrails, distrails, and ‘chemtrails.’ Authors referring to chemtrails claim that this phenomena is much more persistent than contrails and when sprayed in a grid it is able to cover vast area’s.</div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 10.0pt;margin-left: .5in;margin-right: .5in;margin-top: 0in">Although officially denied by government sources many countries performed tests for ‘cloud seeding’ to either generate precipitation where it was needed or to prevent precipitation where it is unwanted. At this moment only the Russian and Chinese governments admit that they use particular matter in order to manipulate weather patterns.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">Divided evenly between the analysis of the effects of contrails and chemtrails, the Belfort study details some interesting findings regarding the effects on both the weather and human health by traditional contrails in addition to the much more dangerous chemtrails. </div>
<p>
According to the study, in regards to the average daily temperature and the overall cloud cover generated by contrails on a regular basis, a survey of the average Diurnal Temperature Range (DTR) was conducted during the rare period that commercial air traffic was grounded on and in the days after September 11, 2001.</p>
<p> It was subsequently determined that a temperature increase of about 10 C occurred during that period in comparison with the normal values. </p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/reiki.html" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-PiX-CKKzjCA/UKbVkah2bEI/AAAAAAAASi8/Txnqy6wL5J0/s240/ad10.jpg"></a>The report states,</p>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 10.0pt;margin-left: .5in;margin-right: .5in;margin-top: 0in">The increase is larger than during the 11-14 September period for the previous 30 years, giving ammunition to critics who state that weather conditions at this specific period were very extraordinary and no scientific based conclusions could be taken. However even more surprising is the fact that the 11-14 September increase in DTR was more than twice the national average for regions in the United States where contrail coverage has previously reported to have been most abundant, such as the Midwest, Northeast, and Northwest regions.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">Furthermore, the report suggests that, after the resumption of normal air traffic, there was a temperature drop of 0.80 C which it then uses to justify claims that contrails and air traffic do affect climate. </div>
</p>
<div class="MsoNormal">The report also states that Cirrus clouds, which are similar to the types of “cloud” formations caused by chemtrail spraying, has a significant effect on both climate and temperature. It reads, </div>
</p>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 10.0pt;margin-left: .5in;margin-right: .5in;margin-top: 0in">The climate of the earth results from an energy balance between absorbed sunlight and radiative losses of heat from earth and its atmosphere to space. Clouds are an important modulator in this balance. Clouds reflect sunlight back towards space, which reduces the solar energy available to the earth – also called the Albedo effect. Clouds also reduce radiative heat losses to space (greenhouse effect). Which of these two opposing processes dominates depends on many parameters include cloud particle composition, cloud structure, cloud cover, and cloud location. Changes to only one of these parameters can have significant implications for climate. </div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 10.0pt;margin-left: .5in;margin-right: .5in;margin-top: 0in">The greenhouse effect is weak for low altitude clouds, so their albedo effect dominates and they cool the Earth’s climate. <u>In contrast, cold high altitude Cirrus clouds may either cool or warm the climate.</u> This will prove to be a key element whether to determine if weather modification are being conducted on the planet in order to reduce ‘global warming.’</div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 10.0pt;margin-left: .5in;margin-right: .5in;margin-top: 0in">Cirrus clouds thus have a strong greenhouse effect, which may outweigh their Albedo effect losses. As the importance of both opposing effects depends critically on little understood properties, theoretical calculations of the climatic effects of Cirrus are controversial. The main uncertainty stems from a current inability to calculate the scattering of sunlight in Cirrus clouds, since they contain a multitude of ice crystal shapes and sizes, and are irregular in structure. Even more, Stefan Kinne of the NASA Ames Research Center states clearly that the Cirrus Albedo effect is severely underestimated by calculations.[1] </div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 10.0pt;margin-left: .5in;margin-right: .5in;margin-top: 0in">This proves that knowledge in this field of science is quite limited and extensive research is mandatory in order to fully understand the impact of Cirrus clouds on climate. In this respect it is noteworthy that evidence of thin Cirrus clouds in the Stratosphere has already been established.[2]</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">With this in mind, the study attributes a substantial amount of climate, environmental, and health risks to the existence of basic contrails, a natural result of regular air traffic. </div>
</p>
<div class="MsoNormal">However, it should also be noted that the Belfort report seems to present an apparent confusion in regards to its own terminology, i.e. contrails vs. chemtrails. This is because the term “contrails” is used in some circumstances as meaning the traditional ice trail produced by normal air traffic, and in other circumstances as meaning the typical chemtrail. </div>
</p>
<div class="MsoNormal">For this reason, this writer suggests interpreting the term “contrails” as “persistent contrails,” since it is the lack of dissipation that would necessarily produce any cloud creation that one usually associates with chemtrails as well as the concerns in relation to precipitation, pollution, and large-scale environmental and health risks.</div>
</p>
<div class="MsoNormal">Nevertheless, in regards to precipitation, the Belfort report summarizes conclusions reached by Professor D. Rosenfeld of the Institute of Earth Sciences at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (Israel). The report states, </div>
</p>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 10.0pt;margin-left: .5in;margin-right: .5in;margin-top: 0in">The conclusion of the study group [Professor Rosenfeld’s] is as follows: both [air pollution, particularly with aerosols, can both increase or decrease rainfall] can be true, depending on local environmental conditions. The amount of aerosols is the critical factor controlling how the energy is distributed in the atmosphere.[3] According to this survey they followed the energy flow through the atmosphere and the way it is influenced by aerosols and other ‘airborne’ particles. On this planet there is indeed an interaction of energy between the different cells within the troposphere in order to obtain a life sustaining temperature (150 C in the International Standard Atmosphere at sea level).</div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 10.0pt;margin-left: .5in;margin-right: .5in;margin-top: 0in">Aerosols act twofold: on one hand they act like a sunscreen reducing the amount of energy reaching the ground. Accordingly less water evaporates and the air mass at ground level stays cooler and drier, with a reduced tendency to rise and form clouds. </div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 10.0pt;margin-left: .5in;margin-right: .5in;margin-top: 0in">Aerosols act as a sunscreen with a subsequent reduction of energy reaching the ground. Some sources refer to this phenomenon as ‘global dimming.’[4]</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<a href="http://activistpost.net/superfoods.html" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" class="noshadow" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-N2GOFRKd8Vs/UF4PWWZ5dsI/AAAAAAAARz4/tuwcrewmlWA/s316/herbalcures.png" style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% transparent;border: medium none" width="160"></a>Yet, according to the Belfort report, there are other variables regarding the connection between aerosols and man-made/incidental precipitation. Namely, the amount of particulate matter such as aerosols that act as nuclei for condensation. As the Belfort report states, </div>
</p>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 10.0pt;margin-left: .5in;margin-right: .5in;margin-top: 0in">. . . if there is a surplus of these condensation nuclei as a result of natural activity (e.g. Vulcan eruption) or men’s intervention (e.g. industrial pollution, contrails) the droplets never reach the critical mass needed to fall to earth as precipitation <u>because there is just not enough water to share between all the aerosol particles</u>. Furthermore with a rising number of droplets their overall surface increases, which on turn increases the amount of sunlight reflected back to space with subsequent cooling and drying of the Earth. </div>
<div class="MsoNormal">Going further, the Belfort report cites a separate study by a Professor Rosenberg where it summarizes his findings by writing:</div>
</p>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 10.0pt;margin-left: .5in;margin-right: .5in;margin-top: 0in">In a nutshell the study of Prof. Rosenberg shows the following: with rising pollution, the amount of precipitation at first rises, then maxes out and finally falls off sharply at very high aerosol concentrations. Of even more interest is his conclusion: ‘The practical result is that in relatively clean air, adding aerosols up to the amount that releases the maximum of available energy increases precipitation. Beyond that point, increasing the aerosol load even further, lessens precipitation.’</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">Thus, aerosol spraying can affect the climate and environment by both increasing or decreasing precipitation and/or,  inversely, causing dehydration as well.</div>
</p>
<div class="MsoNormal">Professor Rosenberg further states that “The determination of this issue is one with significant consequences in an era of climate change and especially in areas suffering from manmade pollution and water shortages, including Israel.” The latter part of this statement should be very alarming to citizens of all nations, considering the fact that <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2010/09/10-reasons-our-fresh-water-supply-is-in_12.html">fresh drinking water</a> is increasingly becoming a highly-valued asset in modern times.</div>

<div class="MsoNormal">Interestingly enough, the Belfort report also mentions three areas of “man-made Cirrus” cloud ramifications that have been understudied (as more of a political reticence than scientific) but that might very well play a part in the changing of the climate. It states,</div>
</p>
<div style="margin-bottom: 10.0pt;margin-left: .75in;margin-right: .5in;margin-top: 0in">The obvious side effects of the formation of contrails is the impact on astronomy. One has seldom a clear sky available for observation in areas with dense air traffic.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 10.0pt;margin-left: .75in;margin-right: .5in;margin-top: 0in">With changing cloud cover and subsequent temperature drop in the upper layer of the troposphere, hurricane activity may be increased as a result of the released instability. It is noteworthy that storms and major floods have more than tripled since 1981. No apparent relationship between aircraft engine emissions, aerosols, contrails and hurricane activity has been established yet on a scientifically basis.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 10.0pt;margin-left: .75in;margin-right: .5in;margin-top: 0in">It is accepted that knowledge on man made Cirrus cloud is relatively poor and that study of the impact of contrails on the Stratosphere is only in its initial phases. However one can assume that it might have an impact on higher layers and the ozone layer. Ozone depletion does not only occur as a result of industrial activity, but also due to multiple nuclear tests conducted in the 20th century.</div>
<div style="margin-left: 0in">Considering the wide range of components necessary to conduct an aerosol spraying campaign, for whatever purposes, there are at least three requirements that must be met in order to conduct such a campaign successfully according to the Belfort report. They are,</div>
<div style="margin-left: 0in"></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 10.0pt;margin-left: .75in;margin-right: .5in;margin-top: 0in">1.)  Development of a reliable matrix of aerosol ingredients versus field conditions.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 10.0pt;margin-left: .75in;margin-right: .5in;margin-top: 0in">2.)  Engineering of an efficient, reliable but low cost system in order to seed the atmosphere.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 10.0pt;margin-left: .75in;margin-right: .5in;margin-top: 0in">3.)  Sponsorship through government agencies with a far-reaching commitment of captains of industry.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<a href="http://activistpost.net/organicfood.html" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/_qLAIskTQXUc/TW_lAOEOZEI/AAAAAAAAHRE/fDi5YhxdsQs/groworganic.jpg"></a>The Belfort Group thus rightly concludes that all of these elements were in place at the time of the publication of the report (2010) except for the reliability factor. However, the report goes on to summarize an extensive history of geo-engineering projects since the mid-20th Century. </div>
</p>
<div class="MsoNormal">Thus, while the report itself does not suggest that the reliability factor exists, the fact that so many years of tests and attempts at geo-engineering does provide the average reader with plenty of reasons to believe that the reliability factor does, in fact exist. Since most projects known to the general public are far behind the true level of sophistication of government/military programs, one would likely be safe in the assumption that the chemtrail/geo-engineering programs are much more advanced than even the Belfort Group is aware of. </div>
</p>
<div class="MsoNormal">In the end, and after approximately seventy pages of documentation, the Belfort Group concludes the following:</div>
</p>
<div style="margin-bottom: 10.0pt;margin-left: .75in;margin-right: .5in;margin-top: 0in">1.)  Manipulation of climate through modification of Cirrus clouds is neither a hoax nor a conspiracy theory, but currently the best option in geo-engineering considered by decision makers to counter global warming. The impact of production of artificial Cirrus clouds on temperature and precipitation patterns is supported by adequate hard scientific evidence.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 10.0pt;margin-left: .75in;margin-right: .5in;margin-top: 0in">2.)  The ambition of the United States is to control the weather by the year 2025, both for civil and military purposes (offensive and defensive strategies). This research paper contains a proven track record to support that statement.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 10.0pt;margin-left: .75in;margin-right: .5in;margin-top: 0in">3.)  The technology to organize spraying actions on a global scale is widely available. Both civil and military aviation is used for that purpose. The mix, containing oxides of metals and chemical components, can either be dispersed through special designed pods or directly incorporated into the jet fuel. This research paper is well documented in this respect.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 10.0pt;margin-left: .75in;margin-right: .5in;margin-top: 0in">4.)  Since the patents are owned by the main defense contractor for the U.S. armed forces (Raytheon) or the U.S. Department of Defense itself and given the history record it is obvious that current climate manipulation programs are organized and directed by the United States government.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 10.0pt;margin-left: .75in;margin-right: .5in;margin-top: 0in">5.)  The spraying actions in Europe are only possible with prior approval and intense co-ordination on top government level and industry on executive level. The general public is intentionally kept unaware of the existence of such projects.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 10.0pt;margin-left: .75in;margin-right: .5in;margin-top: 0in">6.)  Although the spraying actions may be considered legal these actions may have a potential detrimental effect on health. There is sufficient scientific evidence available in this research paper to support this thesis.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">The report also presents four sets of recommendations in going forward regarding chemtrails or, as the report chooses to classify them, manmade contrails.
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 10.0pt;margin-left: .75in;margin-right: .5in;margin-top: 0in">a.)  Artificial Cirrus clouds should be classified as a separate cloud genus by the WMO. Additional scientific research with the effects on nature and public health on this subject should be considered. Results – whatever the outcome – should be made public.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 10.0pt;margin-left: .75in;margin-right: .5in;margin-top: 0in">b.)  It is unacceptable that the AWACS aircraft fleet under NATO operates under a Luxembourg registrations without complying with civil aviation regulations. This is a flagrant violation of the law and this should be corrected in the near future. Given the very unfavorable engine emission ratios of this aircraft retrofitting of these engines should be considered as soon as practical.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 10.0pt;margin-left: .75in;margin-right: .5in;margin-top: 0in">
<a href="http://activistpost.net/stirlinggenerator.html" style="float: right;margin-left: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-S-5zW068uEk/UFYDSijvYrI/AAAAAAAARu8/U_QYOrwWL68/s200/150X200_2.gif" alt=""></a>c.)  When considering a legal case it is better to sue an industrial group, such as Raytheon, rather than a government agency. It is clear for us that the responsibility of Raytheon in this respect is far reaching with the creation of a monopoly in climate modeling or weather as a geo-engineering or a military instrument. If possible an international ban should be placed on such weapons.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 10.0pt;margin-left: .75in;margin-right: .5in;margin-top: 0in">d.)  Although the existence of weather modification projects have been illustrated in an adequate way in this research paper it is now the duty of a serious politician on any level to make enquiries to the government for public release of these spraying schemes through aviation. It is mandatory that such a statement should include the reason why such operations are conducted. It is not an option to hide behind the motive of national security.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">Unfortunately, with the exception of an expanded awareness of chemtrails (or persistent man-made contrails) amongst the general public, the recommendations made by the Belfort Group have gone completely ignored by those in government, science, academia, and the mainstream media ever since its publication. </div>
</p>
<div class="MsoNormal">Regardless, the Belfort Group’s report stands as yet one more documented piece of the puzzle regarding the incessant spraying campaigns now taking place worldwide on a daily basis. While immediate action is not to be expected at this time, the Belfort Group’s report and all other available resources, must be used by those of us who are aware of chemtrail spraying campaigns to educate those of us who are not.</p>

<p>Michael Snyder, <i>Contributor</i><br />
<b><a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2012/05/elite-believe-that-you-are-ruining.html" target="_blank">Activist Post</a></b></p>
<p>Today, there are more than 7 billion people living on earth.  For the global elite, that is problem number one.  The vast majority of us don’t spend much time thinking about global population issues, but for many among the elite it is an absolute obsession.  Many of them truly believe that <i>you</i> are ruining <i>their</i> planet and they desperately want you to stop reproducing so much.</p>
<p>Among the elite, the belief that the world is grossly overpopulated and that this is causing most of our major global problems crosses all political, cultural and social boundaries.  This philosophy is taught as gospel at the vast majority of all colleges and universities on the planet, and it is being relentlessly pushed by the United Nations, the WHO, the World Bank and national governments all over the globe. </p>
<p>When most people think of “overpopulation”, they think of places such as India, but the truth is that those of us living in America are considered to be the worst offenders because our lifestyles are “polluting” the planet so rapidly.  In fact, one scientist recently estimated that a child born in the United States has a “carbon legacy” 55 times greater than a child born in India.  The elite are convinced that if they can reduce the global population far enough and get the remaining people living on earth to switch over to “sustainable lifestyles” that they will be able to save “their” planet.  But the draconian measures that would be necessary to achieve this dystopian dream would not be very palatable to the vast majority of us.  In fact, if the most radical population control advocates get their way, we will experience global tyranny on a scale never seen before.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>Right now, most of us living in the Western world are not prepared to accept “forced” population control measures and the global elite know this.  But the truth is that they absolutely love what is going on right now in places such as China.</p>
<div align="center">
</div>
<p>
In China today, a one child policy is strictly enforced, and women are literally pulled from their homes and taken to abortion clinics when they are found to be in violation.  The following example comes from a recent <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2012/04/30/world/asia/china-forced-abortions/index.html?eref=rss_topstories&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+rss%2Fcnn_topstories+%28RSS%3A+Top+Stories%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader">CNN article</a>….</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>When Ji Yeqing awakened, she was already in the recovery room. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>Chinese authorities had dragged her out of her home and down four flights of stairs, she said, restraining and beating her husband as he tried to come to her aid. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>They whisked her into a clinic, held her down on a bed and forced her to undergo an abortion. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>Her offense? Becoming pregnant with a second child, in violation of China’s one-child policy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/martial-law.html" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" src="https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/martiallaw150x2007.jpg"></a>So does the international community condemn China for such actions? No, in fact the United Nations gives China awards for their population reduction policies.</p>
<p>In the Western world, there are also great efforts underway to reduce family sizes and to get women to choose not to have children, but these efforts are always “voluntary”.  We are told that if women are “empowered” that they will always choose to have fewer children.</p>
<p>But many radical environmentalists are openly complaining that these voluntary methods are not getting the job done fast enough.</p>
<p>For example, the following is from a recent article <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2010/05/population-growth-india-vatican">by Julia Whitty for Mother Jones</a>….</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>The only known solution to ecological overshoot is to decelerate our population growth faster than it’s decelerating now and eventually reverse it—at the same time we slow and eventually reverse the rate at which we consume the planet’s resources. Success in these twin endeavors will crack our most pressing global issues: climate change, food scarcity, water supplies, immigration, health care, biodiversity loss, even war. On one front, we’ve already made unprecedented strides, reducing global fertility from an average 4.92 children per woman in 1950 to 2.56 today—an accomplishment of trial and sometimes brutally coercive error, but also a result of one woman at a time making her individual choices. The speed of this childbearing revolution, swimming hard against biological programming, rates as perhaps our greatest collective feat to date. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>But it’s not enough. And it’s still not fast enough. Faced with a world that can support either a lot of us consuming a lot less or far fewer of us consuming more, we’re deadlocked: individuals, governments, the media, scientists, environmentalists, economists, human rights workers, liberals, conservatives, business and religious leaders.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For radicals such as Whitty, things are never moving fast enough.  They truly believe that humanity is destroying the planet and that they are literally attempting to “save the world” by pushing for global population control.</p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

</script></div>

<p>But this kind of thinking is not just reflected in the writings of a few radicals.</p>
<p>The truth is that “scientific reports” advocating global population control are regularly featured in the most important newspapers all over the planet.</p>
<p>The following example comes from a recent article <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/apr/26/earth-population-consumption-disasters">in the Guardian</a>….</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>World population needs to be stabilised quickly and high consumption in rich countries rapidly reduced to avoid ‘a downward spiral of economic and environmental ills’, warns a major report from the Royal Society. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>Contraception must be offered to all women who want it and consumption cut to reduce inequality, says the study published on Thursday, which was chaired by Nobel prize-winning biologist Sir John Sulston. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>The assessment of humanity’s prospects in the next 100 years, which has taken 21 months to complete, argues strongly that to achieve long and healthy lives for all 9 billion people expected to be living in 2050, the twin issues of population and consumption must be pushed to the top of political and economic agendas.</p>

<p>When was the last time that you saw an article that was 100% opposed to global population control featured in an important newspaper?</p>
<p>Sadly, this population control agenda has a complete stranglehold on the scientific community.  The philosophy that the earth is massively overpopulated and that this overpopulation is causing most of our biggest problems is considered to be gospel at most of our colleges and universities today.</p>
<p>If you question this orthodoxy, you risk being academically blackballed.</p>
<p>Not only that, but the scientific community considers the biggest offenders of all to be Americans because of our “excessive” lifestyles.</p>
<p>For example, just check out what <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2010/05/population-growth-india-vatican?page=3">statistician Paul Murtaugh of Oregon State University</a> said a while back….</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>Using United Nations projections of fertility, and projecting statistically through the lifespan of the mother’s line—some lineages being short-lived, others indefinitely long—an American child born today adds an average 10,407 tons of carbon dioxide to the carbon legacy of her mother. That’s almost six times more CO2 than the mother’s own lifetime emissions. Furthermore, the ecological costs of that child and her children far outweigh even the combined energy-saving choices from all a mother’s other good decisions, like buying a fuel-efficient car, recycling, using energy-saving appliances and lightbulbs. The carbon legacy of one American child and her offspring is 20 times greater than all those other sustainable maternal choices combined.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Murtaugh also believes that a child born in the United States has a “carbon legacy” that is 55 times greater than that of a child born in India.</p>
<div style="float: right;margin-left: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em"><a href="http://activistpost.net/foodcrisis.html"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Rqg5mJth3vk/TtEamLchuUI/AAAAAAAAM2U/8_9pNd_mdG8/s200/300x250.gif" alt=""></a></div>
<p>This helps to explain why the elite are so obsessed with <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/19-facts-about-abortion-in-america-that-should-make-you-very-sick">abortion</a> and “family planning”. The elite are desperate to convince you to stop reproducing.They truly believe that they are helping to “save the world” when they convince us to have less children.</p>
<p>In fact, the amount of money that is being spent to promote “family planning” around the globe is absolutely staggering. For example, according to a recent <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/gatess-4-billion-foray-in-global-family-planning-2012-05-15">MarketWatch article</a> Bill and Melinda Gates plan to spend 4 billion dollars to get contraceptive devices into the hands of 120 million more women by the year 2020….</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>Melinda Gates recently announced a ‘new crusade’ for her $32 billion Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. A recent Newsweek interview with Michelle Goldberg says it’s a ‘decision that is likely to change lives all over the planet.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gates has “decided to make family planning her signature issue,” by investing “billions to revolutionize contraception worldwide,” with substantial economic consequences.</p>
<p>The Gates decision will “be hugely significant for American women.” She’s “pouring money into the long-neglected field of contraceptive research, seeking entirely new methods of birth control,” a “whole new class of drugs,” some that could even work without hormones, and others, might be implantable devises that never need to be removed, can even be turned on and off by the woman.</p>
<p>While Bill and Melinda Gates portray their population control efforts as “humanitarian endeavors”, others among the global elite are more open about what they consider the “endgame” to be.</p>
<p>The following examples are from a recent article <a href="http://www.prisonplanet.com/green-fascism-the-growing-threat-of-eco-tyranny.html">by Paul Joseph Watson</a>….</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>– <a href="http://www.prisonplanet.com/global-warming-alarmist-calls-for-eco-gulags-to-re-educate-climate-deniers.html">Finnish environmentalist guru Pentti Linkola</a>, publicly called for climate change deniers be ‘re-educated’ in eco-gulags and that the vast majority of humans be killed with the rest enslaved and controlled by a green police state, with people forcibly sterilized, cars confiscated and travel restricted to members of the elite. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>– <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070117193434/http://www.taivaansusi.net/politiikka/ekofasismi.html">Another Finnish environmentalist writer</a>, Martin Kreiggeist, hails Linkola’s call for eco-gulags and oppression as ‘a solution,’ calling for people to ‘take up the axes’ in pursuit of killing off the third world. Kreiggeist wants fellow eco-fascists to ‘act on’ Linkola’s call for mass murder in order to solve overpopulation. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>– In 2010, James Lovelock, the creator of the Gaia hypothesis, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2010/mar/29/james-lovelock">told the Guardian</a> that ‘democracy must be put on hold’ to combat global warming and that ‘a few people with authority’ should be allowed to run the planet because people were too stupid to be allowed to steer their own destinies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are a surprising number of people out there that actually advocate for mass murder and mass enslavement for the good of the planet.</p>
<p>Dave Foreman, the co-founder of Earth First, once stated that reducing the global population to 100 million people <a href="http://www.sovereignindependent.com/?p=14751">is one of his three main goals</a>….</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>My three main goals would be to reduce human population to about 100 million worldwide, destroy the industrial infrastructure and see wilderness, with its full complement of species, returning throughout the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sadly, this philosophy has even infected the U.S. government.  The truth is that billions of U.S. taxpayer dollars have been spent to promote population control around the globe, and it hasn’t mattered much whether Republicans or Democrats were in the White House.  The following is an excerpt from an article entitled “<a href="http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/the-population-control-holocaust">The Population Control Holocaust</a>” by Robert Zubrin…..</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>Of the billions of taxpayer dollars that the U.S. government has expended on population control abroad, a portion has been directly spent by USAID on its own field activities, but the majority has been laundered through a variety of international agencies. As a result of this indirect funding scheme, all attempts to compel the population control empire to conform its activities to accepted medical, ethical, safety, or human rights norms have proven futile. Rather, in direct defiance of laws enacted by Congress to try to correct the situation, what has and continues to be perpetrated at public expense is an atrocity on a scale so vast and varied as to almost defy description. Nevertheless, it is worth attempting to convey to readers some sense of the evil that is being done with their money.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you have not read the rest of that article yet, you really should.  You can find the rest of that article <a href="http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/the-population-control-holocaust">right here</a>.</p>
<p>At this point, nearly every major international organization is involved in these population control efforts to at least some degree.</p>
<p>For example, a recent article <a href="http://www.infowars.com/un-world-bank-strangle-sovereign-nations-into-accepting-global-population-reduction-dictates/">by Jurriaan Maessen</a> detailed how the World Bank is actually using “financial assistance” as leverage to get developing nations to conform to the global population control agenda….</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>According to two subsequent documents put out by the World Bank, its guidelines dictate that in order to qualify for World Bank lending, sovereign nations must implement population reduction objectives as outlined by the World Bank and UN Population Fund. If they refuse, lending will be withdrawn. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>Already pre-tested and implemented in Yemen and Niger, these guidelines are destined for global implementation within the next decade, says the World Bank.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Isn’t that sick?</p>

<p>Later in that same article, Maessen discusses how the UN, the WHO, the World Bank and many other international organizations all work together to move this twisted agenda forward….</p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>Returning to the essence, the intention and the strategy leave little for the imagination: a global consensus is in place between all the major transnational institutions and banks: the earth’s population must be brought down, with all means necessary. The World Bank uses financial tools to bring nations on their knees, demanding they cull their numbers; the UN guarantees the political legitimizing for these depopulation policies (Agenda 21); the Foundations develop the anti-fertility vaccines and GM Food, the World Health Organization takes care of the ‘health-standards’ and distribution. With the help of this global construct, carefully coordinated from the top-down, the scientific dictatorship has circled the wagons around all of free humanity.</p>

<p>Sadly, there is so much more that could be said about all of this.  If you are interested in learning more about the disgusting population control agenda of the global elite, the following are 10 more articles I would recommend checking out….</p>

<p>This population control agenda is not going away any time soon.</p>
<p>In fact, thanks to endless propaganda in the media, it is winning over more hearts and minds with each passing day.</p>
<p>Just ask some of your friends what they think.  If you are like most Americans, it is almost inevitable that you will have some friends that believe in global population control.</p>
<p>And without a doubt there will be readers that leave comments at the end of this article supporting the population control agenda of the global elite.</p>
<p>The idea that humanity is ruining the planet and that we need to dramatically reduce our numbers is being relentlessly pushed today.  Millions upon millions of people all over the world have bought into this lie hook, line and sinker.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this philosophy will lead us down a path that will end in absolute global tyranny.</p>

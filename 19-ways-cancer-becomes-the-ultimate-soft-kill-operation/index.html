<p>Paul Adams, J.D.<br /><b><a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2012/07/19-ways-cancer-becomes-ultimate-soft.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Activist Post</a></b></p>
<p>The cancer epidemic is a soft-kill operation and <a href="http://www.electsake.com/pascoreport.htm">a move by the world’s so-called elites</a> to cull the human population.  It is well documented that the Club of Rome, Bill Gates, Ted Turner, the Rockefellers, Warren Buffet and many other globalists plan to dominate and decimate humanity with their <a href="http://www.infowars.com/the-population-reduction-agenda-for-dummies/">population reduction agenda</a>.</p>
<p>As we will see, the globalists first cause the cancer and then provide us with their ineffective treatments (not cures) for profit.   This method is known as <a href="http://www.truthandliberty.com/ProblemReactionSolution.html">Problem – Reaction – Solution</a>.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>According to the <a href="http://www.cancer.org/Research/CancerFactsFigures/CancerFactsFigures/most-requested-tables-figures-2012">American Cancer Society</a>, 1,638,910 new cancer cases will arise in the United States during 2012. Approximately 577,190 American cancer patients are expected to die from their cancer this year as well.  <a href="http://www.cancer.org/Cancer/CancerBasics/lifetime-probability-of-developing-or-dying-from-cancer">One in every two men</a> will suffer from cancer (one in four will die) as will one in every three women (one in five will die).  According to the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/lcod.htm/">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>, cancer is the second leading cause of death, closely trailing heart disease. </p>
<p>In 1971, President Nixon and Congress declared <a href="http://www.csicop.org/si/show/war_on_cancer_a_progress_report_for_skeptics/">war on cancer</a>. Since then, the federal government has spent well over $105 billion to battle cancer. In 2010 alone, the National Cancer Institute had a budget of $6.4 billion.  As of March 2011, the <a href="http://ww5.komen.org/uploadedFiles/Content/AboutUs/Financial/2011%20Komen%20Financial%20Statements%20FINAL%283%29.pdf">Susan B. Komen Foundation</a>, allegedly leading the fight against breast cancer, had $439,451,449 in “total public support and revenue.”  Pharmaceutical giant <a href="http://www.fiercebiotech.com/special-reports/worlds-biggest-rd-spenders/merck-worlds-biggest-rd-spenders">Merck</a> alone had a 2010 research and development budget of 8.12 billion. </p>
<p>Why all the death and suffering despite billions, if not trillions, in government and private cancer research?  Why have cancer treatments remained almost unchanged since the 1950s: toxic radiation, toxic chemotherapy, and surgery? </p>
<p>The answer is simple: treating cancer is profitable; curing it is not.  Cancer also furthers the globalist goal of <a href="http://www.prisonplanet.com/georgia-guidestones-vandalized.html">massive depopulation</a>. </p>
<div align="center">
</div>
<p>
<a href="http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2012/06/01/world-cancer-cases-to-rise-by-75-percent-by-2030/">Worldwide cases of cancer are likely to rise by nearly 75 percent by 2030</a> according to a study published in <i>The Lancet Oncology</i>. A team led by Freddie Bray of the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) in Lyon, France, said that in 2008 there were 12.7 million new cases of cancer, which would rise to 22.2 million by 2030, with 90 percent of the rise occurring in the poorest countries. </p>
<p>In other words, the business forecast for pharmaceutical companies, tax-free cancer foundations and government health organizations is great.  </p>
<p>If you still can’t believe that the cancer epidemic is a soft-kill operation, than you should understand Democide. <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2012/02/democide-mass-murder-and-new-world.html">Democide is the murder of any person or people by a government</a>, including genocide, politicide, and mass murder.  Democide does not include soldiers killed in battle.  During the 20th Century (1900s) alone, Professor R.J. Rummel calculates that government power was used to murder approximately 262,000,000 people. </p>
<p>It is well known by nutritionists and true healers that <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/022804.html">the best way to beat cancer is not to get it</a>. That is, we must have proper nutrition and exercise to keep our immune systems functioning properly.  We must also eliminate all forms of toxins from our every-day environment.  </p>
<p>BPA.  <a href="https://www.niehs.nih.gov/news/sya/sya-bpa/">Bisphenol A</a> (BPA) is a widely used chemical that can behave like estrogen. It is used in the manufacture of polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins. BPA is in many consumer products, including the lining of <a href="http://naturalsociety.com/bpa-found-in-18-of-20-most-popular-food-cans/">food and beverage cans</a>, plastic food packaging, dental sealants, paper receipts and water pipes. Exposure in people is widespread and occurs mainly through eating or drinking contaminated food and beverages.  </p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/teslasecret/" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" class="noshadow" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/_qLAIskTQXUc/TaqAcrCPlhI/AAAAAAAAISQ/5uq527jnmDM/book-shape.jpg" style="background-color: initial;background-image: none;background-position: initial initial"></a>Animal and human studies have linked BPA to hormone-sensitive cancers, including breast and prostate cancers. <a href="http://www.environmentalhealthnews.org/ehs/newscience/2012/05/2012-0605-bpa-brain-cancer-meningioma">A recent study form China</a> found that exposure to BPA may be a risk factor for a common type of brain tumor called meningioma.  The study participants with the highest urine BPA levels were about 1.6 times (160%) more likely to be diagnosed with meningioma compared to those with lower concentrations. </p>
<p>BPA is found in the urine of 95 percent of adults. Research from Harvard University found that eating canned soup can spike your urinary (<a href="http://naturalsociety.com/identifying-toxic-additives/">BPA</a>) levels by 1,200 percent compared to fresh soup.  <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/10/14/us-bpa-idUSTRE69D4MT20101014">Canada</a> lists BPA as a “toxic substance” and has <a href="http://naturalsociety.com/canada-officially-labels-bpa-chemical-as-%25E2%2580%259Ctoxic%25E2%2580%259D/">banned it</a> from being used in baby bottles.  However, in March of 2012, the <a href="http://www.oldthinkernews.com/2012/06/huntsman-corporation-bilderberg-bpa/">FDA blocked a ban on BPA</a> in the United States despite its well-proven links to cancer.  4.7 tons of BPA is expected to be made in 2012 by AkzoNobel N.V., Dover Chemical Corporation, The Dow Chemical Company, Huntsman Corporation, Rhodia (Solvay Group), and SI Group, Inc. </p>
<p>While many consumers now wisely refuse to purchase plastic products unless they are BPA free, many plastic manufactures have replaced BPA, with <a href="http://naturalsociety.com/toxic-bisphenol-s-to-bpa-free-products/#ixzz1yj4JFIEl">Bisphenol-S (BPS)</a>, which may be even more dangerous.  Therefore, it is best to avoid plastic products and use glass instead.  Unfortunately, almost all bottled water is sold in plastic bottles.</p>
<p><b>Fluoride</b>.  Speaking of water, almost every water district in the United States ads toxic sodium fluoride/<a href="http://www.infowars.com/world-net-daily-writer-says-fluoride-is-good-for-you-an-open-letter-to-phil-elmore/">hydrofluosilicic acid</a> to our tap water.  After years of denial, the <a href="http://www.informationliberation.com/?id=18188">CFR/Rockefeller</a> controlled federal government finally admitted that <a href="http://www.infowars.com/bombshell--government-admits-fluoride-hurting-children/">fluoride harms children</a>.  Rather than removing the toxins, the federal government called for a reduction in the amount of fluoride added to public water supplies, citing its negative effect on teeth (dental fluorosis).  Of course it has long been known by real researchers, as opposed to the American Dental Association, that <a href="http://thyroid.about.com//cs/relatedconditions/a/flushot.htm">fluoride harms teeth</a>. </p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2005/jun/12/medicineandhealth.genderissues">Harvard School of Dental Health</a> found that fluoridated causes cancer: </p>

A single dental amalgam filling releases as much as 15 micrograms of mercury per day. The average individual has eight amalgam fillings and could absorb up to 120 micrograms of mercury per day. For comparison, eating mercury-tainted seafood will expose you to about 2.3 micrograms per day.</p>
<p>The National Cancer Institute <a href="http://winningcancer.com/index.php/2010/03/heavy-metals-mercury-and-cancer/">linked periodontal disease to pancreatic cancer</a>. “Our study provides the first strong evidence that periodontal disease may increase the risk of pancreatic cancer,” said Dr. Dominique Michaud of the Harvard School of Public Health in Boston, who led the research.

<p>Published in the journal Cancer Research, the findings also reveal that not all sugars are the same, a widely held belief in mainstream medicine. Tumor cells love both glucose sugar and <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/fructose.html">fructose</a> sugar, but fructose directly causes cancer cells to reproduce and spread in a way that glucose does not. </p>
<p>The study demonstrates that there is a major difference between high fructose corn syrup, a highly-refined sugar commonly used in processed American foods and beverages, and refined sugar cane. Both can lead to health problems, but high fructose corn syrup is worse in terms of cancer growth. </p>
<p>Additionally, a study conducted by David Wallinga, M.D., entitled “Not So Sweet: Missing Mercury and High Fructose Corn Syrup” (<a href="http://healthobservatory.org/library.cfm?refid=105026">http://healthobservatory.org/library.cfm?refid=105026</a>) reveals that nearly one-third of all grocery items sweetened with HFCS were contaminated with mercury. </p>

The average American consumes <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/025442_HFCS_Corn_Refiners_Association.html">12 teaspoons of HFCS every day</a>! So just by eating the standard American diet of processed foods, consumers are right now potentially exposing themselves to exceedingly high levels of mercury that far surpass the safety limits set by the EPA.</p>
<p>High Fructose Corn Syrup also contributes to obesity.  A <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S26/91/22K07/">Princeton University</a> research team demonstrated that rats with access to high-fructose corn syrup gained significantly more weight than those with access to table sugar, even when their overall caloric intake was the same.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/022799.html">Obesity is linked to higher rates of cancer</a>.  According to the American Institute for Cancer Research, more than <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/033124_obesity_cancer.html">100,000 cancer cases</a> in the U.S. are linked to excess body fat – most of them are preventable. </p>
<p><b>Microwave Ovens</b>.  Nearly every home has a microwave oven to quickly heat or cook food.  Yet many studies conducted throughout the world have repeatedly highlighted the deleterious effects of <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/microwave_ovens.html">microwave ovens</a> on human health. In fact <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/microwave.html">microwave</a> ovens are so dangerous that they were banned in Russia from 1976 to 1987. Twenty years of thorough research by Russian scientists convinced them that the dangers of the devices outweighed the benefits in cooking time. </p>
<p>A <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=24342">recent experiment</a> showed that microwaved water given to a plant causes the plant to wither and die within days; however, another identical plant given water that was boiled on a conventional stove grew normally during the same time period.  Therefore, microwave ovens likely alter and destroy your food as well. </p>
<p>Pasteurization was discovered by Louis Pasteur in the mid-1800s. It <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/022967_milk_pasteurization_dairy.html">compromises your milk</a>, <a href="http://renegadehealth.com/blog/2011/03/30/yes-raw-almonds-still-arent-raw">Almonds</a> and <a href="http://www.juicingcafe.com/pasteurizing-juice-dangers-of-juice-pasteurization">juice</a>.  Pasteurization destroys vitamins, enzymes and interferes with absorption. When you boil a liquid, you kill any bacteria and make that food sterile. In the process, you can’t help but affect the taste and nutritional value of that food. Pasteurization is the process of heating a liquid to a high enough temperature to kill certain bacteria and disable certain enzymes. </p>
<p><b>Food Irradiation (radiation)</b>.  The <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/023956_food_irradiation_supply.html">FDA approved food irradiation</a>, the brainchild of the <a href="http://www.preventcancer.com/consumers/food/irradiation.htm">Atomic Energy Commission’s</a> efforts in the Eisenhower administration to find practical uses for the flood of radioactive wastes from nuclear weapons.  Industry and the FDA insist that irradiated food has been thoroughly tested and is absolutely safe. However, New York, New Jersey and Maine have prohibited the sale and distribution of irradiated food, as have foreign governments, including Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Australia and New Zealand. Claims of safety are unproven at best. </p>
<p>Studies have linked food irradiation <a href="http://www.mindfully.org/Food/2003/Irradiation-Cancer5mar03.htm">with increased risk of cancer</a>. </p>
<p><b>Aspartame</b>.  The average person consumes about 2 or 3 mg/kg aspartame each day through diet soda and artificial sweeteners.  A study of rats links low doses of aspartame — the sweetener in NutraSweet, Equal, and thousands of consumer products — to <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/2100-500368_162-712605.html">leukemia and lymphoma</a>.  </p>
<p>“Our study has shown that aspartame is a multipotential <a href="http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/releases/34040.php">carcinogenic compound</a> whose carcinogenic effects are also evident at a daily dose of 20 milligrams per kilogram of body weight (mg/kg), notably less than the current acceptable daily intake for humans,” the authors write. </p>
<p>Donald Rumsfeld, best known for slaughtering Iraqis that had nothing to do with 9/11, is largely responsible for foisting the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robbie-gennet/donald-rumsfeld-and-the-s_b_805581.html">Aspartame soft-kill operation on the public</a>.</p>
<p><b>Chlorine</b>.  Chlorine has been used to disinfect U.S. and British tap water supplies for 100 years. <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-431777/Chlorine-bathwater-linked-cancer.html">Low levels of chlorine in tap water used for bathing</a> can almost double the risk of bladder cancer. <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/09/100913163502.htm">Swimming in public pools</a> can also present a risk because chlorine levels are much higher.</p>
<p>Researchers found that those living in areas with high-chlorine content water, who bathed in it regularly, were 83 per cent more likely to get a tumor than those in low-chlorine areas. Those who drank high-chlorine tap water were 35 per cent more likely to get bladder cancer. Regular <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/030622_chlorine_cancer.html">swimming in pools</a> increased the risk by 57 per cent. </p>

<p>Absorbing chlorine through the skin is thought to be more dangerous because it bypasses the liver, which filters out many harmful chemicals when water is swallowed. </p>
<p>It should be noted that many baby diapers and feminine products (pads/tampons) contain chlorine as the soft-kill operations rolls on.</p>
<p><b>Sodium Nitrate and other preservatives</b> are commonly added to <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/022288_sodium_nitrite_processed_meat.html">processed meat</a> (cold cuts) and are linked with <a href="https://www.dukehealth.org/health_library/health_articles/myth-or-fact-hot-dogs-cause-cancer">increased rates of cancer</a>.  It is best to buy preservative-free meat to avoid being soft-killed by cancer. </p>
<p><b>Nuclear Radiation</b> is also a favorite soft-kill tool as radiation deaths are far <a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/2011/12/21/is-cancer-epidemic-in-america/">more difficult to prove</a> than cigarette smoking deaths, because the source is almost always unknown in its quantity, who it was delivered to, and when.  </p>
<p>Contrary to government propaganda distributed by the mainstream media, there is <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2011/03/3-ways-to-protect-yourself-from.html">no safe dose of radiation</a>. </p>
<p>A French study published in the I<i>nternational Journal of Cancer </i>found a <a href="http://oilprice.com/Alternative-Energy/Nuclear-Power/Study-Finds-that-Childhood-Leukemia-Rates-Double-Near-Nuclear-Power-Stations.html">leukemia rate twice as high among children</a> under the age of 15 living within a 3.1-mile radius of France’s 19 nuclear power plants. The study added to the findings of a German study published in late 2007 studying German children under 5 years old, which found that children of that age in the vicinity of German NPPs had suffered an increase in the incidence of childhood leukemia. </p>
<p>In 2003, a blue ribbon European Committee on Radiation Risk reported <a href="http://www.euradcom.org/2003/execsumm.htm">61,600,000 cancer deaths worldwide</a> from fallout of atom bomb testing during the 1950s and 1960s. Rain brought the fallout back down into the food supply.</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>
This radioactive fallout, as it is called, carries something that’s called strontium-90, which is the most dreadful poison in the world. For only one tablespoon equally shared by all the members of the human race could produce a dangerous level of radioactivity in the bones of every individual.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/miracle-mind.html" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-qowGSTw02Pw/T2NvLdG4KVI/AAAAAAAAOrA/oAUJFUFAexw/s252/160x252.jpg"></a>Lab tests found that children born in 1963 had <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/samuel-s-epstein/atomic-bomb-did-the-atom_b_797822.html">about 50 times more Sr-90</a> in teeth than those born in 1950. Washington University officials used their results in testimony to the U.S. Senate leading to the Partial Test Ban Treaty signed by President John F. Kennedy, ending all above-ground atom bomb tests.</p>
<p>A book published by three prominent scientists concluded that based on records now available, some 985,000 people died, <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=20908">mainly of cancer</a>, as a result of the Chernobyl nuclear reactor accident. That is between when the accident occurred in 1986 and 2004. More deaths, it projects, will follow. </p>
<p>Evidence demonstrates that the <b>Fukushima nuclear debacle</b> is being used as a soft-kill operation, as absolutely nothing significant is being done to stop the continuous leak of radiation.  The Fukushima disaster was entirely foreseen by prominent scientist such as Leuren Moret but <a href="http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/fl20040523x2.html#.T_5xMfXEF6Y">her warning went unheeded</a>. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/asia-pacific/japan/110415/fukushima-death-toll-meltdown-chernobyl?page=0,0">Arnold Gunderson</a>, a 39-year veteran of the nuclear industry, stated:</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>
The numbers I’ve seen, from reputable scientists, are that Fukushima is going to kill 200,000 from increased cancers over the next 50 years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Likewise, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0H-mtsdsgg&amp;feature=player_embedded">Dr. Christopher Busby</a>, Scientific Secretary of the European Committee on Radiation Risk, states that 400,000 people will develop cancer within a 200 kilometer radius of Fukushima. </p>
<p>One estimate states that the fallout from the Fukushima nuclear meltdown resulted <a href="http://www.radiation.org/reports/JapanUpdateTo22000.pdf">in 21,851 U.S. deaths</a> within the first 14 weeks of the emergency. The rise in reported deaths after Fukushima was largest among the United States for <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/medical-journal-article--14000-us-deaths-tied-to-fukushima-reactor-disaster-fallout-135859288.html">infants under age one</a>. </p>
<p><b>GM Crops may cause cancer</b>.  Dr. Stanley Ewen, a consultant histopathologist at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, says that a cauliflower [mosaic] virus used in GM foods could <a href="http://www.ghorganics.com/GM%20food%20can%20cause%20cancer.htm">increase the risk of stomach and colon cancers</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.smashcancer.com/2011/03/30/do-gmo-foods-cause-cancer/">Monsanto’s GM-derived rBGH</a> (which is a genetically-altered growth hormone given to dairy cows to make them more milk) was shown to increase the production of IGF-1 from 70-1000%.  IGF-1 is a very powerful hormone that has been linked to a 2.5-4 times higher incidence of human colon, breast and prostate cancer. </p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p>The global elite have clearly implemented their <a href="http://www.infowars.com/obama-science-advisor-called-for-planetary-regime-to-enforce-totalitarian-population-control-measures/">depopulation agenda</a> and are spiking our food, air, water and bodies with toxins to give us cancer.  These elites then profit immensely by selling us drugs through the <a href="http://vactruth.com/2012/07/09/7-examples-pharma-fraud/">pharmaceutical companies they control</a>.  These drugs normally provide temporary relief from cancer/disease systems, while being falsely marketed as a cure <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/028194_Scott_Reuben_research_fraud.html">by fake studies and perverted statistics</a>. </p>

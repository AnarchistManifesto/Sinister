<p> (<a href="https://www.naturalnews.com">Natural News</a>)<br />
 Over the last two years, you have been witnessing an attempted deep state coup against the United States of America, carried out by what can only be called an <strong>organized crime ring</strong> of treasonous criminals like Robert Mueller, James Comey, Loretta Lynch, John Brennan and Hillary Clinton.</p>
<p>Now, fearless independent journalism Sharyl Attkisson has <a href="https://sharylattkisson.com/2018/05/20/collusion-against-trump-timeline/">put together a complete timeline of the deep state coup attempt against Trump</a>, detailing the multiple layers of criminality, treason and lies that now characterize “the establishment.”</p>
<p>Below, find a full reprinting of the timeline, as published on her website. Be sure to also keep tabs on our own reporting on all this — the <strong>most outrageous political conspiracy in the history of our country — </strong>by reading the following websites: <a href="http://JamesComey.news" target="_blank">JamesComey.news</a> | <a href="http://RobertMueller.news" target="_blank">RobertMueller.news</a> | <a href="http://FBIcorruption.news" target="_blank">FBIcorruption.news</a> | <a href="http://DeepState.news" target="_blank">DeepState.news</a> | <a href="http://Clinton.news" target="_blank">Clinton.news</a></p>
<h2>2011</h2>
<p>U.S. intel community vastly expands its surveillance authority, giving itself permission to spy on Americans who do nothing more than “mention a foreign target in a single, discrete communication.” Intel officials also begin storing and entering into a searchable database sensitive intelligence on U.S. citizens whose communications are accidentally or “incidentally” captured during surveillance of foreign targets. Prior to this point, such intelligence was supposed to be destroyed to protect the constitutional privacy rights the U.S. citizens. However, it’s required that names U.S. citizens be hidden or “masked” –even inside U.S. intel agencies –to prevent abuse.</p>
<div class="woo-sc-hr"></div>
<h2>2012</h2>
<p><strong><em>July 1, 2012:</em></strong> Secretary of State Hillary Clinton improperly uses unsecured, personal email domain to email President Obama from Russia.</p>
<div class="woo-sc-hr"></div>
<h2>2013</h2>
<p><strong><em>June 2013:</em> </strong>FBI interviews U.S. businessman Carter Page, who’s lived and worked in Russia, regarding his ongoing contacts with Russians. Page reportedly tells FBI agents their time would be better spent investigating Boston Marathon bombing (which the FBI’s Andrew McCabe helped lead). Page later claims his remark prompts FBI retaliatory campaign against him. The FBI, under McCabe, will later wiretap Page after Page becomes a Donald Trump campaign adviser.</p>
<p>FBI secretly records suspected Russian industrial spy <a href="http://time.com/5132126/carter-page-russia-2013-letter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Evgeny Buryakov</a>. It’s later reported that Page helped FBI build the case.</p>
<p><strong><em>Sept. 4, 2013:</em></strong> James Comey becomes FBI Director, succeeding Robert Mueller.</p>
<div class="woo-sc-hr"></div>
<h2>2014</h2>
<p>Russia invades Ukraine. Ukraine steps up hiring of U.S. lobbyists to make its case against Russia and obtain U.S. aid. Russia also continues its practice of using U.S. lobbyists.</p>
<p>Ukraine forms National Anti-Corruption Bureau as a condition to receive U.S. aid. The National Anti-Corruption Bureau later signs evidence-sharing agreement with FBI related to Trump-Russia probe.</p>
<p>Ukrainian-American Alexandra Chalupa, a paid consultant for the Democratic National Committee (DNC), begins researching lobbyist <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/ukraine-sabotage-trump-backfire-233446" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paul Manafort’s</a> Russia ties.</p>
<p>FBI investigates, and then wiretaps, Paul Manafort for allegedly not properly disclosing Russia-related work. FBI fails to make a case, according to CNN, and discontinues wiretap.</p>
<p><strong><em>August 2014:</em></strong> State Dept. turns over 15,000 pages of documents to Congressional Benghazi committee, revealing former secretary of state Hillary Clinton used private server for government email. Her mishandling of classified info on this private system becomes subject of FBI probe.</p>
<div class="woo-sc-hr"></div>
<h2>2015</h2>
<p>FBI opens <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2016/05/23/politics/terry-mcauliffe-fbi-doj-federal-investigation-campaign-contributions/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">investigation</a> into Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe, including for donations from a Chinese businessman and Clinton Foundation donor.</p>
<p>FBI official Andrew McCabe meets with Gov. McAuliffe, a close Clinton ally. Afterwards, “McAuliffe-aligned political groups donated about $700,000 to Mr. McCabe’s wife…for her campaign to become a Democrat state Senator in Virginia.” The fact of the McAuliffe-related donations to wife of FBI’s McCabe—while FBI was investigating McAuliffe and Clinton—later becomes the subject of <a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2017-05-02%20CEG%20to%20DOJ%20(McCabe%20Continuing%20Conflicts).pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conflict of interest</a> inquiry by Inspector General.</p>
<p><strong><em>Feb. 9, 2015:</em></strong> U.S. Senate forms Ukrainian caucus to further Ukrainian interests. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) is a member.</p>
<p><strong><em>March 4, 2015:</em></strong> New York Times breaks news about Clinton’s improper handling of classified email as secretary of state.</p>
<p>In internal <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/6391" target="_blank" rel="noopener">emails</a>, Clinton campaign chairman (and former Obama adviser) John Podesta suggests Obama withhold Clinton’s emails from Congressional Benghazi committee under executive privilege.</p>
<p><em><strong>March 2015:</strong></em> Attorney General Loretta Lynch privately directs FBI Director James Comey to call FBI Clinton probe a “matter” rather than an “investigation.” Comey follows the instruction, though he later <a href="http://time.com/4811380/comey-testimony-loretta-lynch-email/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">testifies</a> that it made him “queasy.”</p>
<p><em><strong>March 7, 2015:</strong></em> President Obama says he first learned of Clinton’s improper email practices “through news reports.” Clinton campaign staffers privately <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/article/441430/wikileaks-hillary-clinton-barack-obama-emails-more-evidence-president-lied" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contradict</a> that claim emailing: “…it looks like [President Obama] just said he found out [Hillary Clinton] was using her personal email when he saw it on the news.” Clinton aide Cheryl Mills responds, “We need to clean this up—[President Obama] has emails from” Clinton’s personal account.</p>
<p><em><strong>May 19, 2015:</strong></em> <span class="f">Justice Dept. </span>Assistant Attorney General for Legislative Affairs Peter Kadzik <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2016/11/02/politics/peter-kadzik-john-podesta-wikileaks/index.htm">emails</a> Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta from a private Gmail account to give him a “heads ups” involving Congressional questions about Clinton email.</p>
<p><strong><em>Summer 2015:</em></strong> Democratic National Committee computers are hacked.</p>
<p><strong><em>Sept. 2015:</em></strong> Glenn Simpson, co-founder of political opposition research firm Fusion GPS, is <a href="https://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/3/9/3974a291-ddbe-4525-9ed1-22bab43c05ae/934A3562824CACA7BB4D915E97709D2F.simpson-transcript-redacted.pdf">hired</a> by conservative website Washington Free Beacon to compile negative research on presidential candidate Donald Trump and other Republicans.</p>
<p><em><strong>Oct. 2015:</strong></em> President Obama uses a “confidentiality tradition” to keep his Benghazi emails with Hillary Clinton secret.</p>
<p><strong><em>Oct. 12, 2015:</em></strong> FBI Director Comey <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/louis-e.-bladel-iii-named-special-agent-in-charge-of-counterintelligence-division-of-the-new-york-division">replaces</a> head of FBI Counterintelligence Division at New York Field Office with Louis Bladel.</p>
<p><em><strong>Oct. 22, 2015:</strong></em> Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/hillary-clinton-is-not-under-criminal-investigation-549318723860?playlist=associated">publicly</a> states that Clinton is “not under criminal investigation.”</p>
<p>Clinton testifies to House Benghazi committee.</p>
<p><strong><em>Oct. 23, 2015:</em></strong> Clinton campaign chair John Podesta meets for dinner with small group of friends including a top Justice Dept. official Peter Kadzik.</p>

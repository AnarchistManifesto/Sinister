<a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2013/01/65-percent-of-americans-believe-that.html"><b>Activist Post</b></a></p>
<p>Do you believe that economic trouble is coming in 2013?  If so, you  have a lot of company.  According to a brand new Gallup poll that was  just released, <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/159596/americans-unsure-best-times-past.aspx" target="_blank" title="65 percent">65 percent</a> of Americans believe that 2013 will be a year of “economic difficulty” while only <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/159596/americans-unsure-best-times-past.aspx" target="_blank" title="33 percent">33 percent</a>  of Americans believe that 2013 will be a year of “economic  prosperity”.</p>
<p>Gallup has been asking this question for a lot of years,  and the percentage of Americans that are anticipating economic  difficulty in the year ahead has not been this high since the early  1980s.  And without a doubt, there are <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/50-predictions-for-2013" title="a whole lot of reasons">a whole lot of reasons</a>  to be deeply concerned about the economy as we head into the new year.</p>
<p>But it isn’t just 2013 that Americans are pessimistic about. According  to the new Gallup poll, <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/159596/americans-unsure-best-times-past.aspx" target="_blank" title="50 percent">50 percent</a> of all Americans believe that the best days of America are behind us, and only <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/159596/americans-unsure-best-times-past.aspx" target="_blank" title="47 percent">47 percent</a>  of all Americans believe that the best days of America are ahead of  us.  Those are very sobering numbers.  Half the country believes that it  is only downhill from here for the United States.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>Unfortunately, they  are exactly right.  Things are rapidly going to get worse for our  economy and for our nation as a whole.  We are going to start reaping  the consequences of decades of very foolish decisions, and the pain is  going to be immense.</p>
<p>Gallup asked some other very interesting questions as well.  The following are some of the other results <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/159596/americans-unsure-best-times-past.aspx" target="_blank" title="from the poll">from the poll</a>…</p>
<p>-68 percent of Americans believe that 2013 will be a year of rising crime rates.</p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>-57 percent of Americans believe that 2013 will be a year in which American power will decline in the world.</p>
<p>-82 percent of Americans believe that 2013 will be a year in which taxes in the United States will rise.</p>

<p>
So why are so many people so pessimistic as we enter 2013?</p>
<p>That is a good question.  I think that a lot of people are starting  to wake up and are realizing the gigantic problems that are staring the  U.S. right in the face.</p>
<p>Even our friends over in Europe can see what is happening to us.  We  are like a former athletic champion that is now clearly on the wrong  side of “middle age” and is exhibiting obvious signs of decline.  We  still like to think of ourselves as “the champ”, but the truth is that  we are fat, lazy, broken down and bankrupt.  The following is a brief  excerpt from an article that appeared in <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2256289/America-cliff--rest-it.html" target="_blank" title="a major UK news source">a major UK news source</a> the other day…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The rest of the world — dangerously reliant on a  buoyant U.S. — should note one thing above all: the fundamentals of  America’s economy are, frankly, terrible, and its international  dominance is not nearly as assured as it once was.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Its economic culture has started to change since President Obama entered the White House four years ago this month. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>America more closely resembles Europe in living beyond its  means and in the President’s determination to build a massive welfare  state.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The mainstream media and most of our politicians endlessly proclaim  that things are about to turn around and that a “recovery” is on the  way, but that is not even close to the truth.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/familysurvival.html" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-l-x8YmPjCms/UCFiDY6YweI/AAAAAAAAROM/G87HmWjJ5ZY/s220/20.gif"></a>Fortunately, a few of our politicians realize what is really  happening and are willing to talk about it.  Unfortunately, not enough  people are listening to them.</p>
<p>For example, Ron Paul has a really good grasp on how destructive the  U.S. national debt is and how we are literally destroying the bright  future that our children and our grandchildren should have had.  The  following is what he posted <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ronpaul" target="_blank" title="on his Facebook page">on his Facebook page</a> the other day about the “fiscal cliff deal” that just got pushed through Congress…</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>We Are Already Over the Fiscal Cliff</b><br />
2 January 2013 </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Despite claims that the Administration and Congress saved America  from the fiscal cliff with an early morning vote today, the fact is that  government spending has already pushed Americans over the cliff. Only  serious reductions in federal spending will stop the cliff dive from  ending in a crash landing, yet the events of this past month show that  most elected officials remain committed to expanding the welfare-warfare  state. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>While there was much hand-wringing over the “draconian” cuts that  would be imposed by sequestration, in fact sequestration does not cut  spending at all. Under the sequestration plan, government spending will  increase by 1.6 trillion over the next eight years. Congress calls this a  cut because without sequestration spending will increase by 1.7  trillion over the same time frame. Either way it is an increase in  spending. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Yet even these minuscule cuts in the “projected rate of spending”  were too much for Washington politicians to bear. The last minute “deal”  was the worst of both worlds: higher taxes on nearly all Americans now  and a promise to revisit these modest reductions in spending growth two  months down the road. We were here before, when in 2011 Republicans  demanded these automatic modest decreases in government growth down the  road in exchange for a massive increase in the debt ceiling. As the time  drew closer, both parties clamored to avoid even these modest moves. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Make no mistake: the spending addiction is a bipartisan problem. It  is generally believed that one party refuses to accept any reductions in  military spending while the other party refuses to accept any serious  reductions in domestic welfare programs. In fact, both parties support  increases in both military and domestic welfare spending. The two  parties may disagree on some details of what kind of military or  domestic welfare spending they favor, but they do agree that they both  need to increase. This is what is called “bipartisanship” in Washington. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>While the media played up the drama of the down-to-the-wire  negotiations, there was never any real chance that a deal would not be  worked out. It was just drama. That is how Washington operates. As it  happened, a small handful of Congressional and Administration leaders  gathered in the dark of the night behind closed doors to hammer out a  deal that would be shoved down the throats of Members whose constituents  had been told repeatedly that the world would end if this miniscule  decrease in the rate of government spending was allowed to go through. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/ultimatesurvivalplan.html" style="float: right;margin-left: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em" target="_blank"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-CTsdDqKcvhI/T7GjToaksaI/AAAAAAAAO2s/8vEb9HmqOhk/s316/160x316.gif" alt=""></a>While many on both sides express satisfaction that this deal only  increases taxes on the “rich,” most Americans will see more of their  paycheck going to Washington because of the deal. The Tax Policy Center  has estimated that 77 percent of Americans would see higher taxes  because of the elimination of the payroll tax cut. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The arguments against the automatic “cuts” in military spending were  particularly dishonest. Hawks on both sides warned of doom and gloom if,  as the plan called for, the defense budget would have returned to 2007  levels of spending! Does anybody really believe that our defense  spending was woefully inadequate just five years ago? And since 2007 we  have been told that the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are winding down. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>According to the Congressional Budget Office, over the next eight years  military spending would increase 20 percent without the sequester and  would increase 18 percent with the sequester. And this is what is called  a dangerous reduction in defense spending? </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Ironically, some of the members who are most vocal against tax  increases and in favor of cuts to domestic spending are the biggest  opponents of cutting a penny from the Pentagon budget. Over and over we  were told of the hundreds of thousands of jobs that would be lost should  military spending be returned to 2007 levels. Is it really healthy to  think of our defense budget as a jobs program? Many of these allegedly  free-market members sound more Keynesian than Paul Krugman when they  praise the economic “stimulus” created by militarism. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As Chris Preble of the Cato Institute wrote recently, “It’s easy to  focus exclusively on the companies and individuals hurt by the cuts and  forget that the taxed wealth that funded them is being employed  elsewhere.” </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>While Congress ultimately bears responsibility for deficit spending,  we must never forget that the Federal Reserve is the chief enabler of  deficit spending. Without a central bank eager to monetize the debt,  Congress would be unable to fund the welfare-warfare state without  imposing unacceptable levels of taxation on the American people. Of  course, the Federal Reserve’s policies do impose an “inflation” tax on  the American people; however, since this tax is hidden Congress does not  fear the same public backlash it would experience if it directly raised  income taxes. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I have little hope that a majority of Congress and the President will  change their ways and support real spending reductions unless forced to  by an economic crisis or by a change in people’s attitudes toward  government. Fortunately, increasing numbers of Americans are awakening  to the dangers posed by the growth of the welfare-warfare state.  Hopefully this movement will continue to grow and force the politicians  to reverse course before government spending, taxing, and inflation  destroys our economy entirely.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was good that Ron Paul placed blame on both political parties and on the Federal Reserve for our debt problems.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/category/federal-reserve" title="Federal Reserve">Federal Reserve</a>  is not often talked about much when it comes to assigning blame for the  debt, but it truly is one of the primary reasons why our debt is so  enormous today.  The Federal Reserve system was designed to be a <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/what-if-we-adopted-a-system-where-the-banks-did-not-create-our-money" title="perpetual government debt machine">perpetual government debt machine</a>, and it has accomplished that task very well.</p>
<p>When the Federal Reserve was first created, the total U.S. national debt was less than 3 billion dollars. That is about as much as we add to the U.S. national debt <b>every single day</b> at this point. And since Ben Bernanke took the reigns at the Fed, our debt problems have greatly accelerated. The U.S. national debt <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2013/01/national-debt-doubles-under-bernanke/" target="_blank" title="has more than doubled">has more than doubled</a> from a little over $8 trillion to <a href="http://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/BPDLogin?application=np" target="_blank" title="more than $16.4 trillion">more than $16.4 trillion</a> since Ben Bernanke became chairman of the Federal Reserve in 2006.</p>
<p>But disaster has not struck yet, so most Americans think that everything must be okay.</p>

<p>But if you are wise, you will try to understand what is coming and  you will make preparations so that you and your family will be able to  withstand the storm that is coming.  Here are some basic steps that I  suggest…</p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>-Use this time of relative prosperity to work hard and make money  while you still can. You want to store up your finances during the good  times to help you get through the lean times.</p>

<p>-Get out of debt.  You don’t want massive amounts of debt weighing you down when things get really hard.</p>
<p>-Get more independent of the world system.  Start a side business in  the evenings and the weekends.  Learn how to grow your own food.  Get  your house off of the grid if possible.  Anything you can do to become  more independent and more self-sufficient is good.</p>
<p>-Store food and other essential supplies.  Right now we take for  granted that the supermarkets and the big box stores will always be  packed with mountains of quality goods at affordable prices.  That may  not always be the case.  You want to be prepared for whatever may  happen.</p>

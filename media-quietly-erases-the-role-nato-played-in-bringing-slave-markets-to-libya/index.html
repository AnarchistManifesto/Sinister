<p><strong>(<a href="http://fair.org/home/media-nato-regime-change-war-libya-slave-markets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FAIR</a>)</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400">— </span>Twenty-first century slave markets. Human beings sold for a few hundred dollars. Massive protests throughout the world.</p>
<p>The American and British media have awakened to the grim reality in Libya, where African refugees are being sold in open-air slave markets. Yet a crucial detail in this scandal has been downplayed or even ignored in many corporate media reports: the role of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in bringing slavery to the North African nation.</p>
<p>In March 2011, NATO launched a war in Libya expressly aimed at toppling the government of longtime leader Moammar Qadhafi. The US and its allies flew some <a href="https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_71652.htm#">26,000 sorties</a> over Libya and launched hundreds of cruise missiles, destroying the Qadhafi government’s ability to resist rebel forces. American and European leaders initially claimed the military intervention was being carried out for humanitarian reasons, but political scientist Micah Zenko (<strong>Foreign Policy</strong>, <a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/03/22/libya-and-the-myth-of-humanitarian-intervention/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3/22/16</a>) used NATO’s own materials to show how “the Libyan intervention was about regime change from the very start.”</p>
<p>NATO supported an array of rebel groups fighting on the ground in Libya, many of which were dominated by Islamist extremists and harbored violently racist views. Militants in the NATO-backed rebel stronghold of Misrata even <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/aug/30/libya-spectacular-revolution-disgraced-racism">referred</a> to themselves in 2011 as “the brigade for purging slaves, black skin”—an eerie foreshadowing of the horrors that were to come.</p>
<p>The war ended in October 2011. US and European aircraft attacked Qadhafi’s convoy, and he was brutally murdered by extremist rebels. The government soon dissolved.</p>
<p>In the six years since, Libya has been roiled by chaos and bloodshed. Multiple would-be governments are competing for control of the oil-rich country, and in some areas there is still no functioning central authority. Many thousands of people have died, although the true numbers are impossible to verify. Millions of Libyans have been displaced—a staggering number, nearly one-third of the population, had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/10/world/africa/libya-refugees-tunisia-tripoli.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fled</a> to neighboring Tunisia by 2014.</p>
<p>Corporate media, however, have largely forgotten about the key role NATO played in destroying Libya’s government, destabilizing the country and empowering human traffickers.</p>
<p>Moreover, even the few news reports that do acknowledge NATO’s complicity in the chaos in Libya do not go a step further and detail the well-documented, violent racism of the NATO-backed Libyan rebels who ushered in slavery after ethnically cleansing and committing brutal crimes against black Libyans.</p>
<h5><strong>O NATO, Where Art Thou?</strong></h5>
<p><strong>CNN</strong> (<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/11/14/africa/libya-migrant-auctions/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">11/14/17</a>) published an explosive story in mid-November that offered a firsthand look at the slave trade in Libya. The media network obtained terrifying video that shows young African refugees being auctioned, “big strong boys for farm work,” sold for as little as $400.</p>
<p>The flashy <strong>CNN</strong> multimedia report included bonuses galore: two videos, two animated gifs, two photos and a chart. But something was missing: The 1,000-word story made no mention of NATO, or the 2011 war that destroyed Libya’s government, or Moammar Qadhafi, or any kind of historical and political context whatsoever.</p>
<p>Despite these huge flaws, the <strong>CNN</strong> report was widely celebrated, and made an impact in a corporate media apparatus that otherwise cares little about North Africa. A flurry of media reports followed. These stories overwhelmingly spoke of slavery in Libya as an apolitical and timeless human rights issue, not as a political problem rooted in recent history.</p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>In follow-up stories, when Libyan and United Nations officials announced they would launch an investigation into the slave auctions, <strong>CNN</strong> (<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/11/17/africa/libya-slave-auction-investigation/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">11/17/17</a>, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/11/20/africa/un-secretary-general-libya-slave-auctions/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">11/20/17</a>) again failed to mention the 2011 war, let alone NATO’s role in it.</p>
<p>One <strong>CNN</strong> report (<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/11/21/africa/un-security-council-libya-slave-trade/index.html">11/21/17</a>) on a UN Security Council meeting noted, “Ambassadors from Senegal to Sweden also blamed trafficking’s root causes: unstable countries, poverty, profits from slave trading and lack of legal enforcement,” but  failed to explain <em>why</em> Libya is unstable.</p>
<p>Another 1,200-word <strong>CNN</strong> follow-up article (<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/11/23/africa/libya-reaction-slave-trade/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">11/23/17</a>) was just as obfuscatory. It was only in the 35th paragraph of this 36-graf story that a Human Rights Watch researcher noted, “Libyan interim authorities have been dragging their feet on virtually all investigations they supposedly started, yet never concluded, since the 2011 uprising.” NATO’s leadership in this “2011 uprising” was, however, ignored.</p>
<p>An <strong>Agence France-Presse</strong> news wire that was published by <strong>Voice of America</strong> (<a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/africa-union-calls-libya-slave-market-probe/4122200.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">11/17/17</a>) and other websites similarly failed to provide any historical context whatsoever for the political situation in Libya. “Testimony collected by <strong>AFP</strong> in recent years has revealed a litany of rights abuses at the hands of gang leaders, human traffickers and the Libyan security forces,” the article said, but it did not recount anything that happened before 2017.</p>
<p>Reports by the <strong>BBC</strong> (<a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-42038451" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">11/18/17</a>), the<strong> New York Times</strong> (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/20/world/middleeast/libya-slave-auction-un.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">11/20/17</a>), <strong>Deutsche Welle</strong> (reprinted by <strong>USA Today</strong>, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2017/11/23/slave-trade-libya-outrage-across-africa/891129001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">11/23/17</a>) and the <strong>Associated Press</strong> (reprinted by the<strong>Washington Post</strong>, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/rwanda-offers-to-shelter-african-migrants-abused-in-libya/2017/11/23/d29ef858-d05b-11e7-a87b-47f14b73162a_story.html?utm_term=.286c6f90e548" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">11/23/17</a>) also failed to mention the 2011 war, let alone NATO’s role in it.</p>
<p>Another <strong>New York Times</strong> story (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/19/world/africa/libya-migrants-slavery.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">11/19/17</a>) did provide a bit of context:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Since the Arab Spring uprising of 2011 ended the brutal rule of Col. Moammar Qadhafi, Libya’s coast has became a hub for human trafficking and smuggling. That has fueled the illegal migration crisis that Europe has been scrambling to contain since 2014. Libya, which slid into chaos and civil war after the revolt, is now divided among three main factions.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet the <strong>Times</strong> still erased NATO’s key place in this 2011 uprising.</p>
<p>In an account of the large protests that erupted outside Libyan embassies in Europe and Africa in response to the reports, <strong>Reuters</strong> (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-libya-slavery-migrants/sale-of-migrants-in-libya-slave-markets-sparks-global-outcry-idUSKBN1DK2AU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">11/20/17</a>) noted, “Six years after the fall of Moammar Qadhafi, Libya is still a lawless state where armed groups compete for land and resources and people-smuggling networks operate with impunity.” But it did not provide any more information about how Qadhafi was toppled.</p>
<p>A report in the <strong>Huffington Post</strong> (<a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/video-slave-auction-migrants-libya_us_5a161d56e4b064948072e9f3?ncid=%20edlinkusaolp00000029" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">11/22/17</a>), later republished by <strong>AOL</strong> (<a href="https://www.aol.com/article/news/2017/11/27/video-of-migrants-sold-in-apparent-slave-auction-in-libya-provokes-outrage-worldwide/23289149/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">11/27/17</a>), did concede that Libya is “one of the world’s most unstable, mired in conflict since dictator Moammar Qadhafi was ousted and killed in 2011,” but made no mention of NATO’s leadership in that ousting and killing.</p>
<p>Part of the problem has been the unwillingness of international organizations to point out the responsibility of powerful governments. In his statement  on the reports of slavery in Libya, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres (<a href="https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2017-11-20/secretary-general%E2%80%99s-statement-reported-news-slavery-libya" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">11/20/17</a>) did not mention anything about what has happened politically inside the North African nation in the past six years. The <strong>UN News Centre</strong> report (<a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=58127#.WhyJIlWnGUm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">11/20/17</a>) on Guterres’ comments was just as contextless and uninformative, as was the press release (<a href="https://www.iom.int/news/iom-joins-un-sg-call-end-libya-migrant-slave-trade" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">11/21/17</a>) on the issue from the International Organization for Migration.</p>
<p><strong>Al Jazeera</strong> (<a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/countingthecost/2017/11/migrants-sale-slave-trade-libya-171126063748575.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">11/26/17</a>) did cite an IOM official who suggested, in <strong>Al Jazeera</strong>‘s words, that “the international community should pay more attention to post-Qadhafi Libya.” But the media outlet provided no context as to how Libya became “post-Qadhafi” in the first place. In fact, <strong>Al Jazeera</strong>‘s source went out of his way to make the issue apolitical: “Modern-day slavery is widespread around the world and Libya is by no means unique.”</p>
<p>While it is true that slavery and human trafficking happen in other countries, this widespread media narrative depoliticizes the problem in Libya, which has its roots in explicit political decisions made by governments and their leaders: namely, the choice to overthrow Libya’s stable government and turn the oil-rich North African nation into a failed state, ruled by competing warlords and militias, some of which are involved in and profit from slavery and trafficking.</p>
<h5><strong>Selective Attention to NATO’s Aftermath in Libya</strong></h5>
<p>Corporate media reporting on Libya largely mirrors reporting on Yemen (<strong>FAIR.org</strong>, <a href="http://fair.org/home/ignoring-washingtons-role-in-yemen-carnage-60-minutes-paints-us-as-savior/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">11/20/17</a>, <a href="http://fair.org/home/media-yemen-us-saudi-airstrikes-killing-civilians/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">8/31/17</a>, <a href="http://fair.org/home/downplaying-us-contribution-to-potential-yemen-famine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2/27/17</a>), Syria (<strong>FAIR.org</strong>, <a href="http://fair.org/home/the-return-of-the-dangerous-obama-did-nothing-narrative-on-syria/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">4/7/17</a>, <a href="http://fair.org/home/the-syrian-refugee-crisis-and-the-do-something-lie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">9/5/15</a>) and beyond: The role of the US government and its allies in creating chaos abroad is minimized, if not outright ignored.</p>
<p>Strikingly, one of the only exceptions to this overwhelming media trend came back in April from, of all places, the <strong>New York Times</strong> editorial board. The <strong>Times</strong> editorial (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/14/opinion/another-degree-of-suffering-in-libya.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">4/14/17</a>) did not mince words, directly linking the US-backed military operation to the ongoing catastrophe:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“None of this would be possible if not for the political chaos in Libya since the civil war in 2011, when — with the involvement of a NATO coalition that included the United States — Col. Moammar Qadhafi was toppled. Migrants have become the gold that finances Libya’s warring factions.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a significant reversal. Immediately after NATO launched its war in Libya in March 2011, the <strong>Times</strong> editorial board (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/22/opinion/22tue1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3/21/11</a>) cheered on the bombing, effusing, “Col. Moammar Qadhafi has long been a thug and a murderer who has never paid for his many crimes.” It waxed poetic on the “extraordinary,” “astonishing” military intervention, and hoped for Qadhafi’s imminent downfall.</p>
<p>The April 2017 <strong>Times</strong> editorial stopped far short of a being a mea culpa, yet it was still a rare admission of truth.</p>
<p>At the time this surprisingly honest editorial was written, there had briefly been a bit of media attention to Libya. The International Organization for Migration had just conducted an investigation into slavery in post–regime change Libya, leading to a string of news reports in the<strong> Guardian</strong> (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/10/libya-public-slave-auctions-un-migration" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">4/10/17</a>) and elsewhere. Practically as soon as this appalling story got the interest of corporate media, however, it quickly died out. Attention shifted back to Russia, North Korea and the bogeymen of the day.</p>
<p>When Western governments were hoping to militarily intervene in the country in the lead-up to March 19, 2011, there was a constant torrent of media reports on the evils of Qadhafi and his government—including a healthy dose of fake news (<strong>Salon</strong>, <a href="https://www.salon.com/2016/09/16/u-k-parliament-report-details-how-natos-2011-war-in-libya-was-based-on-lies/">9/16/16</a>). Major newspapers staunchly <a href="https://www.alternet.org/grayzone-project/top-us-newspapers-libya-syria-regime-change" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">supported the NATO intervention</a>, and made no secret of their pro-war editorial lines.</p>
<p>When the US government and its allies were preparing for war, the corporate media apparatus did what it does best, and helped sell yet another military intervention to the public.</p>
<p>In the years since, on the other hand, there has been exponentially less interest in the disastrous aftermath of that NATO war. There will be short spikes of interest, as there was in early 2017. But the coverage rapidly peaks and goes away. The most recent spurt of press coverage was inspired by the publication of <strong>CNN</strong>‘s shocking video footage.</p>
<h5><strong>The Extreme Racism of Libyan Rebels</strong></h5>
<p>The catastrophe Libya might endure after the collapse of its state had been predictable at the time. Qadhafi himself had <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/07/gaddafi-warned-blair-of-threat-from-opening-door-to-al-qaida">warned</a> NATO member states, while they were waging war against him, that they were going to unleash chaos throughout the region. Yet Western leaders—Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton in the US, David Cameron in the UK, Nicolas Sarkozy in France, Stephen Harper in Canada—ignored Qadhafi’s admonition and violently toppled his government.</p>
<p>Yet even from the small number of media reports on slavery in Libya that do manage to acknowledge NATO’s responsibility for destabilizing the country, something is still missing.</p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>Looking back at Libya’s anti-Qadhafi rebels, both during and after the 2011 war, it is very clear that hardline anti-black racism was widespread in the NATO-backed opposition. A 2016 investigation by the British House of Common’s Foreign Affairs Committee (<strong>Salon</strong>, <a href="https://www.salon.com/2016/09/16/u-k-parliament-report-details-how-natos-2011-war-in-libya-was-based-on-lies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">9/16/16</a>) acknowledged that “militant Islamist militias played a critical role in the rebellion from February 2011 onwards.” But many rebels were not just fundamentalist; they were also violently racist.</p>
<p>It is unfortunately no surprise that these extremist Libyan militants later enslaved African refugees and migrants: They were hinting at it from the very beginning.</p>
<p>Most American and European media coverage at the time of NATO’s military intervention was decidedly pro-rebel. When reporters got on the ground, however, they began publishing a few more nuanced pieces that hinted at the reality of the opposition. These were insignificant in number, but they are enlightening and worth revisiting.</p>
<p>Three months into the NATO war, in June 2011, the <strong>Wall Street Journal</strong>‘s Sam Dagher (<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304887904576395143328336026" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">6/21/11</a>) reported from Misrata, Libya’s third-largest city and a major hub for the opposition, where he noted he saw rebel slogans like “the brigade for purging slaves, black skin.”</p>
<p>Dahger indicated that the rebel stronghold of Misrata was dominated by “tightly knit white merchant families,” whereas “the south of the country, which is predominantly black, mainly backs Col. Qadhafi.”</p>
<p>Other graffiti in Misrata read “Traitors keep out.” By “traitors,” rebels were referring to Libyans from the town of Tawergha, which the <strong>Journal</strong> explained is “inhabited mostly by black Libyans, a legacy of its 19th-century origins as a transit town in the slave trade.”</p>
<p>Dagher reported that some Libyan rebel leaders were “calling for the expulsion of Tawerghans from the area” and “banning Tawergha natives from ever working, living or sending their children to schools in Misrata.” He added that predominately Tawergha neighborhoods in Misrata had already been emptied. Black Libyans were “gone or in hiding, fearing revenge attacks by Misratans, amid reports of bounties for their capture.”</p>
<p>The rebel commander Ibrahim al-Halbous told the <strong>Journal</strong>, “Tawergha no longer exists, only Misrata.”</p>
<p>Al-Halbous would later reappear in a report by the<strong> Sunday Telegraph</strong> (<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/libya/8754375/Gaddafis-ghost-town-after-the-loyalists-retreat.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">9/11/11</a>), reiterating to the British newspaper, “Tawarga no longer exists.” (When Halbous was injured in September, the <strong>New York Times</strong>—<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/21/world/africa/qaddafi-assails-libya-government-that-replaced-him.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">9/20/11</a>—portrayed him sympathetically as a martyr in the heroic fight against Qadhafi. The Halbous brigade has in the years since become an <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-libya-security/for-libya-u-n-deal-former-rebel-brigades-mean-success-or-failure-idUSKCN0SU0M420151105" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">influential</a> militia in Libya.)</p>
<p>Like Dagher, the <strong>Telegraph</strong>‘s Andrew Gilligan drew attention to the slogan painted on the road between Misrata and Tawergha: “the brigade for purging slaves [and] black skin.”</p>
<p>Gilligan reported from Tawergha, or rather from the remnants of the majority-black town, which he noted had “been emptied of its people, vandalized and partly burned by rebel forces.” A rebel leader said of the mostly black residents, “We said if they didn’t go, they would be conquered and imprisoned. Every single one of them has left, and we will never allow them to come back.”</p>
<p>Gilligan noted “a racist undercurrent. Many Tawargas, though neither immigrants nor Qadhafi’s much-ballyhooed African mercenaries, are descended from slaves, and are darker than most Libyans.”</p>
<p>NATO assisted these virulently racist rebels in Misrata. NATO frequently launched <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/africa/04/24/libya.war/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">air attacks</a> on the city. <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/nato-charge-libya-fly-zone-united-states/story?id=13210685" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">French fighter jets</a> shot down Libyan planes over Misrata. The <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-12796972" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">US and UK</a> fired cruise missiles at Libyan government targets, and the US launched Predator drone strikes. The <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/canadian-jets-bomb-libyan-target-in-first-attack/article4266667/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Canadian air force</a> also attacked Libyan forces, pushing them out of Misrata.</p>
<p>In a public relations video NATO published in May 2011, early in the Libya war, the Western military alliance openly admitted that it intentionally allowed “Libyan rebels to transport arms from Benghazi to Misrata.” Political scientist Micah Zenko (<strong>Foreign Policy</strong>, <a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/03/22/libya-and-the-myth-of-humanitarian-intervention/">3/22/16</a>) pointed out the implications of this video: “A NATO surface vessel stationed in the Mediterranean to enforce an arms embargo did exactly the opposite, and NATO was comfortable posting a video demonstrating its hypocrisy.”</p>
<p>Throughout the war and after, Libyan rebels continued carrying out racist sectarian attacks against their black compatriots. Human Rights Watch’s longtime executive director <a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2011/03/19/does-the-world-belong-in-libyas-war-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kenneth Roth</a> cheered on NATO intervention in Libya in 2011, calling the UN Security Council’s unanimous endorsement of a no-fly zone a “remarkable” confirmation of the so-called “responsibility to protect” doctrine.</p>
<p>Yet even HRW documented Libyan militants’ crimes against dark-skinned Libyans and migrants. In September 2011, when the war was still ongoing, HRW <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2011/09/04/libya-stop-arbitrary-arrests-black-africans" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a> on Libyan rebels’ “arbitrary arrests and abuse of African migrant workers and black Libyans assumed to be [pro-Qadhafi] mercenaries.”</p>
<p>Then in October, the top US human rights organization noted that <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2011/10/30/libya-militias-terrorizing-residents-loyalist-town" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Libyan militias</a> were “terrorizing the displaced residents of the nearby town of Tawergha,” the majority black community that had been a stronghold of support for Qadhafi. “The entire town of 30,000 people is abandoned—some of it ransacked and burned—and Misrata brigade commanders say the residents of Tawergha should never return,” HRW added. Witnesses “gave credible accounts of some Misrata militias shooting unarmed Tawerghans, and of arbitrary arrests and beatings of Tawerghan detainees, in a few cases leading to death.”</p>
<p>In 2013, HRW reported further on the <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2013/03/20/libya-stop-revenge-crimes-against-displaced-persons" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ethnic cleansing</a> of the black community of Tawergha. The human rights organization, whose executive director had supported the military intervention, wrote: “The forced displacement of roughly 40,000 people, arbitrary detentions, torture and killings are widespread, systematic and sufficiently organized to be crimes against humanity.”</p>
<p>These atrocities are well documented, and they lead a path straight to the enslavement of African refugees and migrants. But to acknowledge NATO’s complicity in empowering these racist extremist militants, corporate media would have to acknowledge NATO’s role in the 2011 regime change war in Libya in the first place.</p>

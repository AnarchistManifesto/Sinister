<p>The legal claims on physical gold far exceed the amount of physical  gold that the banks actually have by a very, very wide margin.  And  right now the bankers are scared out of their wits because their  warehouses are being drained of physical gold at a frightening rate.</p>
<p>So  what happens when their physical gold is gone but they still have lots  and lots of people with legal claims to gold?  When that moment arrives,  it will represent the end of the paper gold scam.  Many believe that  the recent <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/10-signs-the-takedown-of-paper-gold-has-unleashed-an-unprecedented-global-run-on-physical-gold-and-silver" title="takedown of the price of paper gold">takedown of the price of paper gold</a>  was a desperate attempt by the bankers to put off that day of  reckoning, but it appears to have greatly backfired on them. Instead of  cooling off demand for precious metals, it has unleashed a massive “<a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-30/gold-rush-from-dubai-to-istanbul-drains-supply-as-premiums-jump.html" target="_blank" title="gold rush">gold rush</a>”  all over the globe.  Meanwhile, word has been spreading among wealthy  families in both North America and Europe that they had better grab  their physical gold out of the banks while they still can.  This is  creating havoc in the financial community, and at least one major  international bank has already declared that it will only be settling  those accounts in cash from now on.</p>
<p>The paper gold scam is starting to  unravel, and by the time this is all over it is going to be a complete  and total nightmare for global financial markets.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>For years it has been widely known that the promises that banks have  made regarding their gold far exceed their actual ability to deliver,  but we have never reached a moment of such crisis before.</p>
<p>Posted below are quotes from people that know precious metals far  better than I do.  What these experts are saying is more than a little  bit disturbing…</p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

–<a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/video/cme-s-duffy-says-exchange-competition-helps-market-6rSibzdvRRGnC9Ldgfo~XQ.html" target="_blank" title="CME President Terry Duffy">CME President Terry Duffy</a>:  What’s interesting about gold, when we had that big break two weeks ago  we saw all the gold stocks trade down significantly, we saw all the  gold products trade down significantly, but one thing that did not trade  down, was gold coins, tangible real gold. That’s going to show you,  people don’t want certificates, they don’t want anything else. They want  the real product.</p>
<p>–<a href="http://kingworldnews.com/kingworldnews/KWN_DailyWeb/Entries/2013/4/27_Sprott_-_Incredible_Global_Gold_Rush_Triggers_%243,000_Target.html" target="_blank" title="Billionaire Eric Sprott">Billionaire Eric Sprott</a>:  So we see all of these paper (trading) volumes going through that bear  absolutely no relationship to what’s going on in the physical markets.  As you know I have always been a proponent of the fact that supply in  the gold market was way less than demand, and by a very large factor. I  think demand exceeds supply by at least 60%. The central banks are  surreptitiously supplying that gold, and ultimately they will be running  on fumes.</p>
<p>When we hear about the LBMA not willing to deliver gold, and JP  Morgan’s inventories at the COMEX have gone from 2.4 million (ounces)  down to 160,000 ounces, it just makes you realize that all of this paper  trading means nothing. It’s the real physical market that you have to  rely on.</p>
<p>–<a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/contributed/2013-04-22/why-western-banking-cartel%E2%80%99s-gold-and-silver-price-slam-will-backfire-and-how" target="_blank" title="JS Kim">JS Kim</a>:  FACT #1: COMEX gold vaults were recently drained of 2 million ounces of  physical gold in one quarter, the largest withdrawal of physical gold  bullion from COMEX vaults in one quarter during this entire 12-year gold  and silver bull. There has been speculation about the reasons that  spurred these massive withdrawals of gold from COMEX vaults, but the  most reasonable speculation is that no one trusts the bankers to hold on  to their physical gold anymore, especially in light of Fact #2.</p>
<p>Note  below, that both registered AND eligible stocks of gold had heavily  declined in recent months. Such an event signals a general distrust of  the banking system from everyone holding gold in registered COMEX  vaults.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/backyardliberty.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 0em;margin-left: 1em"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-k0NQ-rOJPq0/UPDSF5crnFI/AAAAAAAATcw/i7Q6pBk-hoQ/s200/BL_013-200.gif" alt=""></a>FACT #2: One of the largest European banks, ABN Amro, defaulted on  their gold contracts and informed their clients that they would only  settle their gold bullion contracts in cash and not in physical. So much  for the supposed legality of financial contracts as a “binding”  contract. So whether Fact #1 caused Fact #2 or vice versa is irrelevant.  What IS apparent is that the level of trust in bankers to safekeep  physical gold and physical silver is disappearing, as it should be, and  as it should have already been for years now. But truth always takes  some time to catch up to banker spread lies and that is what is  happening now. I have been warning people never to trust bankers in  deals involving gold and silver for years now, as in this article I  wrote nearly four years ago informing the public that the SLV and GLD  are likely a banker invented scam as well.</p>
<p>FACT #3: Silver fraud whistleblower and London trader Andrew Maguire  stated that the LBMA was having trouble settling gold contracts in  bullion as well and stated that institutions that asked for physical  settlement “were told they would be cash settled instead by a bullion  bank.” In plain English, this is a default. So Andrew Maguire reported  that the LBMA had already gone into default.</p>
<p>In light of Fact #1 and  Fact #2, the dominoes were starting to tumble and the house of cards  that the bankers had built in gold and silver paper derivatives to  deceive and hide the true fundamentals of the physical gold and physical  markets from the entire world was rapidly starting to crumble. A  financial earthquake of magnitude 2.5 was quickly threatening to evolve  into one of the biggest financial earthquakes of all time in which the  world’s confidence in all global fiat currencies would effectively have a  well-deserved funeral.</p>
<p>–<a href="http://kingworldnews.com/kingworldnews/KWN_DailyWeb/Entries/2013/4/24_Sinclair_-_Full-Blown_Panic_As_People_Ask_Where_Is_The_Gold.html" target="_blank" title="Jim Sinclair">Jim Sinclair</a>:  I think the reality is the supply situation is extremely volatile at  this point, and even discussing it is like rubbing a raw nerve to the  people who are in charge. The amount of discussion on the subject of  warehouse supply, supply that is represented by the gold leases,  indicated to the central planners that the demand for physical was going  to continue to effect the exchanges.</p>
<p>Although they did not expect any grandstand delivery, the mere  continued draining of physical inventories was threatening the very  functioning of the paper exchange. That threatening of the paper  exchange and its ability to continue functioning is really taking off  the blinders and revealing the truth behind the critical question,  ‘Where is the gold?’</p>
<p>The question now is, ‘Where has the gold gone?’ Who has all of this  gold? Because of the nature of gold leasing, all of this gold has been  purchased and it has gone somewhere. The reality of the empty vaults  reveal that the gold has gone missing.</p>
<p>–<a href="http://bullmarketthinking.com/ronald-stoeferle-last-week-we-were-really-close-to-a-default-of-the-130-to-1-paper-gold-market/" target="_blank" title="Ronald Stoeferle">Ronald Stoeferle</a>:  We’re seeing this rush to physical gold not only in the retail market,  but also for the institutional players…[it’s] just overwhelming…I  [estimate] a 130-to-1 [ratio of paper to physical gold]…and I think in  the last week we were really close to [triggering] a default of the  paper market.</p>
<p>–<a href="http://truthingold.blogspot.co.uk/2013/04/the-global-fractional-paper-bullion_6103.html" target="_blank" title="Gerhard Schubert, head of Precious Metals at Emirates NBD">Gerhard Schubert, head of Precious Metals at Emirates NBD</a>:  I have not seen in my 35 years in precious metals such a determined and  strong global physical demand for gold. The UAE physical markets have  been cleared out by buyers from all walks of life. The premiums, which  have been asked for and which have been paid have been the cornerstone  of the gold price recovery. It is very rare that physical markets can  have a serious impact on market prices, which are normally driven solely  by derivatives and futures contracts…</p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>I did speak during the week with several refineries in the world, of  course including the UAE refineries, and the waiting period for 995 kilo  bars is easily 2-3 weeks and goes into June in some cases. A large  portion of the 995 kilo bars in the UAE goes normally into the Indian  market, but a lot of the available 995 kilo bars are destined for  Turkey, at this time. We heard that premiums paid in Turkey have reached  anything between US $ 20 and US $ 35 per ounce.</p>
<p>–<a href="http://kingworldnews.com/kingworldnews/KWN_DailyWeb/Entries/2013/5/7_James_Turk_-_Extraordinary_Delays_For_Physical_Gold_%26_Silver.html" target="_blank" title="James Turk">James Turk</a>:  Another indication of the demand for large bars is the huge drawdown in  the gold stock in COMEX warehouses. It is noteworthy that COMEX reports  show the drawdown is largely the result of dealers removing their  inventory, their working stock. When that happens, you know the  availability of supply is constrained.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bloggersecret.com" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 0em;margin-left: 1em"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-W_QDsMeuL2M/T8kFjUwCVXI/AAAAAAAAPEk/RT2DHTDyOsI/s300/300x250_v002.gif" width="200"></a>What all of this means, Eric, is one thing. If the central planners  want to keep the precious metals at these low prices, to meet the demand  for physical metal they will need to empty more metal from central bank  vaults, or borrow metal from the ETFs as some have suggested is  happening. Otherwise, the central planners will have to step back and  stop their intervention, thereby letting the price of gold and silver  rise so that demand tapers off, bringing demand and supply of physical  metal back toward some kind of balance.</p>
<p>We’ve seen this same situation several times over the last twelve  years. It is what I have been calling a “managed retreat.” Despite the  current weakness, I firmly believe we have again entered a critical  period where the central planners will need to retreat once again in  order to let the gold and silver prices climb higher.</p>
<p>–<a href="http://truthingold.blogspot.co.uk/2013/04/the-global-fractional-paper-bullion_6103.html" target="_blank" title="The Golden Truth">The Golden Truth</a>:  And then I get a call from a close friend in NYC last Friday.   His  career has been in private wealth management in the private bank  department of the Too Big To Fail banks.  He’s been looking for work and  chats with old colleagues all the time.  He called my Friday and told  me he just got off the phone with a very high level private banker from a  big Euro-based TBTF bullion bank, but who was at JP Morgan until about  six months ago.</p>
<p>This guy told my friend that there is a scramble by many very wealthy  European families/entities to get their 400 oz bars out of the big bank  vaults. He knows this personally, for a fact.  He said the private  banker community is small over there and the big wealthy families all  talk to each other and act on the same rumors/sentiment.  The  Bundesbank/Fed and the ABN/Amro situations triggered this move.  He  knows for a fact JPM tried to calm fears about 3 months ago by sending a  letter to it’s very wealthy clients assuring them their bars were safe,  in allocated accounts.  He said right now those same families are  walking into the big banks like JPM and demanding delivery of their bars  or threatening to take their $100’s of millions in investment  portfolios to competitors.  His wording was “these people are putting a  gun to the heads of private banks and demanding their gold.”</p>
<p>I know this information is good because I know my friend’s background  and when he tells me his source is plugged in, the guy is plugged in.  Not only that, my friend’s source said that there’s no doubt that  someone like a John Paulson, not necessarily specifically him, but  entities like him or it may include him, have held a gun to GLD and  demanded delivery of physical in exchange for their shares.</p>
<p>Regarding the Bundesbank/Fed situation, recall that the Bundesbank  asked to have some portion of its gold sitting – supposedly – in the NY  Fed vault in NYC sent back Germany. The total amount is 1800 tonnes.   After behind the scenes negotiations, the Fed agreed to ship 300 tonnes  back over seven years.  To this day, the time required for that shipment  has never been explained.  Venezuela demanded the return of its 200  tonnes held in London, NYC and Switzerland and received it all within  about four months.</p>
<p>And regarding the ABN/Amro situation.  ABN/Amro offered a gold  investment account product that offered physical delivery of the gold in  the investment account when the investor cashes out.  About a week  before the gold price smash, ABN sent a letter to its clients informing  that the physical delivery of the bullion was no longer available and  that all accounts would be settled with cash at redemption.<br />
I believe it was these two events that triggered the big scramble for  physical gold by wealthy families/entities who were suspicious of the  integrity of their bank vault custodial arrangement anyway.</p>
<p>*****</p>
<p>So what does all of this mean?</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/currency-crisis.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/_qLAIskTQXUc/TZJ5ITi2iAI/AAAAAAAAH5Y/jC67Wheg2uY/Dragon_180x150.jpg"></a>It means that we are entering a period when there will be  unprecedented volatility for precious metals.  There will be tremendous  ups and downs as this crisis plays out and the bankers try to keep the  paper gold scam from completely unraveling.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, nations such as China continue to stockpile gold as if the end of the world was coming.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-05-08/chinese-gold-imports-soar-monthly-record-insatiable-demand" target="_blank" title="Zero Hedge">Zero Hedge</a>, Chinese gold imports set a brand new all-time record high in March…</p>

</div>
<p>Quite the contrary: as export data released by the <a href="http://www.censtatd.gov/" target="_blank" title="Hong Kong Census and Statistics Department">Hong Kong Census and Statistics Department</a> overnight showed, <strong>Chinese gold imports in March exploded to an all time record high of 223.5 tons.</strong></p>
<p>And the number for April is expected to be even higher.</p>
<p>Does <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/tag/china" title="China">China</a> know something that the rest of us do not?</p>
<p>We are also seeing a rapid decoupling between spot prices and  physical prices.  In fact, it is quickly getting to the point where the  spot price of gold and the spot price of silver are becoming irrelevant.</p>
<p>For example, demand for silver coins has become so intense that some dealers are charging premiums <strong>of up to 30 percent</strong> over spot price for silver eagles.</p>
<p>That would have been regarded as insane a few years ago, but people  are now willing to pay these kinds of premiums.  People are recognizing  the importance of actually having physical gold and silver in their  possession and they are willing to pay a significant premium in order to  get it.</p>
<p>We are moving into uncharted territory.  The paper gold scam is  rapidly coming to an end.  In the long term, this will greatly benefit  those that are holding significant amounts of physical gold and silver.</p>

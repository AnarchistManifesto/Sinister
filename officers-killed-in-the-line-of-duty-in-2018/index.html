</p></div>
<p>Florida Deputy William Gentry died on May 7, a day after being shot in the head while responding to a dispute between neighbors over a cat that had been shot, police said.</p>
<p>After speaking with the cat&#8217;s owner, the Highlands County officer approached the man suspected of shooting the cat, Joseph Edward Ables, 69, at his Lake Placid front door. Sheriff Paul Blackman said Ables then shot Gentry in the head shortly before 8 p.m. on May 6. The deputy was airlifted to a Fort Myers hospital.</p>
<div class="ad-container mobile ad-h-250">
<div class="ad gpt" id="mobile-300x251"></div>
</p></div>
<p>The sheriff&#8217;s office statement said Ables was a convicted felon with a history of violence toward law enforcement.</p>
<p>Gentry, 40, was a field training officer and served for over nine years with the Highlands County Sheriff&#8217;s Office, where his brother is a detective, Blackman said.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is an unimaginable tragedy for our agency,&#8221; the sheriff added. </p>

<p>Pitts, who served with the police department for 16 years, was fatally wounded when a homicide suspect opened fire on Pitts and other officers from the second floor of a Terre Haute apartment building. He was taken to a local hospital but died shortly after.</p>
<p>The suspect was later shot and killed during a standoff with officers.</p>
<p>“Rob is deeply missed, but we are grateful for the time we had with him,&#8221; Terre Haute police spokesman Ryan Adamson said Saturday. “Thank you for your continued prayers.”</p>

<p>Officer Jesus &#8220;Chuy&#8221; Cordova with the Nogales Police Department in Arizona died on April 27 <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/04/28/arizona-police-officer-fatally-shot-trying-to-apprehend-carjacker.html" target="_blank">after he was shot multiple times</a> while attempting to pull over an armed carjacker. </p>
<p>The gunman, later identified as 28-year-old David Ernesto Murillo, jumped out of the car and opened fire, fatally wounding Cordova.</p>
<p>“The community of Nogales will never be the same but we hope that this unity continues well into the future,” said Nogales Police Chief Roy Bermudez.</p>
<p>The officer served with the police department for roughly a year. Before that, the 44-year-old had served with the Santa Cruz County Sheriff&#8217;s Office for a decade. He is survived by his fiancee, who is pregnant, and his three children. </p>

<p>Deputy Sheriff Casey Shoemate was responding to a 911 call of a residential structure fire on April 20 when he was involved in a head-on collision.</p>

<p>Gilchrist County Sheriff Bobby Schultz described the two officers as “the best of the best.” </p>
<p>“They don’t need to be remembered strictly for their untimely death, but they need to be remembered for the type of people that they are,” he said. “And that’s good individuals, good deputy sheriffs.”</p>

Christopher Bergner of the Los Angeles County Sheriff&#8217;s Department told reporters. A second officer was injured, authorities said.</p>
<p>The confrontation led to a 15-hour standoff with authorities and ended with the suspect&#8217;s arrest March 10, Los Angeles County Sheriff Jim McDonnell said.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the last 15 hours, we attempted to make an arrest of this individual and just did so successfully minutes ago,&#8221; McDonnell said during a news conference.</p>
<p>The situation began when Pomona officers received a report of a &#8220;person driving recklessly,&#8221; the Los Angeles County Sheriff&#8217;s Department said in a <a href="http://nixle.us/9YZFP" target="_blank">statement</a>. The suspect ultimately led police on a chase before crashing and fleeing on foot. The suspect then &#8220;ran into an apartment complex and the officers gave chase,&#8221; Capt. Christopher Bergner of the Los Angeles County Sheriff&#8217;s Department said.</p>
<p>Dispatchers received a call of an &#8220;officer down,&#8221; at around 9:10 p.m. local time. Pomona police Chief Mike Olivieri said in a tweet that one officer had died and the other was in stable condition.</p>

<p>The alleged shooter, later identified as James Waters, opened fire from inside the house when officers tried to apprehend the individual. The suspect was found dead inside the home.</p>
<p>Since news of Morton&#8217;s death broke, authorities announced that Morton and the other officers <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/03/08/missouri-police-officer-killed-responding-to-911-call-was-at-wrong-house-officials-say.html" target="_blank">were sent to the wrong house</a> &#8212; about 15 miles away from where they were supposed to be.</p>
<p>&#8220;The 911 call that came in was somehow attached to that [Clinton] address,&#8221; Missouri Highway Patrol Sgt. Bill Lowe said, according to the <a href="http://www.kansascity.com/news/local/crime/article204015984.html" target="_blank">Kansas City Star.</a></p>
<p>Lowe said it was a &#8220;coincidence&#8221; the officers were directed to that address.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is tragic that happened. But the fact is they were in the act of committing crimes within that house,&#8221; Lowe said. &#8220;When (the officers) entered that house, they were doing what they needed to ensure no one was hurt and there wasn&#8217;t any other problems.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lowe said the loss would greatly impact the &#8220;small department.&#8221; </p>
<p>“It’s a small department. It’s small enough that you know each individual officer and the community knows each individual officer, and it’s hard to put into words when you’re talking about an agency of this size, a community of this size where something tragic like this happened just seven months ago,” he said.</p>
<p>Morton, a 30-year-old Army veteran, was with the Clinton Police Department from February 2015 through January 2017, the <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/police-officer-in-western-missouri-killed-hurt-after-call-of/article_3a7ceaed-2830-5924-b16a-a7c63ab1b426.html" target="_blank">St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports</a>.

<p>After finding the slain woman, police identified her ex-husband, Robert Hollie, as a “person of interest.” Billa and other officers with the Mobile Police Department established a perimeter around Hollie’s house and asked him to come out, but he opened fire instead, Mobile Police Chief Lawrence Battiste said.</p>
<p>Billa was shot and later died at a hospital, according to Battiste. Hollie was also killed in the shooting, though it’s unclear if he shot himself or was struck by officers.</p>
<p>Billa, who was named “Officer of the Month” in June 2016, had only been on the force for two years. When <a href="https://www.mobilepd.org/officer-of-the-month/justin-billa/" target="_blank">he was given the award</a>, his commanding officer praised his attention to detail and professionalism.</p>
<p>“We need to go back to helping people instead of just taking them to jail and creating bigger problems,” Billa <a href="http://www.fox10tv.com/story/32441567/mpd-officers-open-up-about-police-relations" target="_blank">told WALA-TV</a> in July 2016. “That’s my idea of good policing, and I feel like that’s what the chief is working towards.”</p>
<p>Billa also said he spent time with his wife before he left for work every day.</p>
<p>&#8220;She tells me she loves me every day before I leave for work. And I make sure I do the same,&#8221; he added.</p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

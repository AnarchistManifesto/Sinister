<p>Washington can’t stop lying.  Don’t be convinced by last Thursday’s  job report that it is your fault if you don’t have a job. Those 288,000  jobs and 6.1% unemployment rate are more fiction than reality.</p>
<p>In his analysis of the June Labor Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, John Williams (<a href="http://www.paulcraigroberts.org/2014/07/07/virtual-economys-phantom-job-gains-based-statistical-fraud-paul-craig-roberts/www.ShadowStats.com" target="_blank">www.ShadowStats.com</a>)  wrote that the 288,000 June jobs and 6.1% unemployment rate  are “far  removed from common experience and underlying reality.” Payrolls were  overstated by “massive, hidden shifts in seasonal adjustments,” and the  Birth-Death model added the usual phantom jobs.</p>
<p>Williams reports that “the seasonal factors are changed each and  every month as part of the concurrent seasonal-adjustment process, which  is tantamount to a fraud,” as the changes in the seasonal factors can  inflate the jobs number.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>The monthly unemployment rates are not comparable, so one doesn’t  know whether the official U.3 rate (the headline rate that the financial  press reports) went up or down. Moreover, the rate does not count  discouraged workers who, unable to find a job, cease looking. To be  counted among the U.3 unemployed, the person must have actively looked  for work during the four weeks prior to the survey. The U.3 rate  automatically declines as people who have been unable to find jobs cease  trying to find one and thereby cease to be counted as unemployed.</p>
<p>There is a second official measure of unemployment that includes  people who have been discouraged for less than one year. That rate,  known as U.6, is seldom reported and is double the 6.1% rate. Since 1994 there has been no official measure than includes  discouraged people who have not looked for a job for more than a year.  Including all discouraged workers produces an unemployment rate that  currently stands at 23.1%, almost four times the rate that the financial  press reports.</p>

<p>
What you can take away from this is the opposite of what the  presstitute media would have you believe.  The measured rate of  unemployment can decline simply because large numbers of the unemployed  become discouraged workers, cease looking for work, and cease to be  counted in the U.3 and U.6 measures of the unemployment rate.</p>
<p>The decline in the employment-population ratio from 63% prior to the  2008 downturn to 59% today reflects the growth in discouraged workers.   Indeed, the ratio has not recovered its previous level during the  alleged recovery, an indication that the recovery is an illusion created  by the understated measure of inflation that is used to deflate nominal  GDP growth.</p>
<p>Another indication that there has been no recovery is that Sentier  Research’s index of real median household income continued to decline  for two years after the alleged recovery began in June 2009.   There has  been a slight upturn in real median household income since June 2011,  but income remains far below the pre-recession level.</p>
<p>The Birth-Death model adds an average of 62,000 jobs to the reported  payroll jobs numbers each month. This arbitrary boost to the payroll  jobs numbers is in addition to the Bureau of Labor Statistics’  underlying assumption that unreported jobs lost to business failures are  matched by unreported new jobs from new business startups, an  assumption that does not well fit an economy that fell into recession  and is unable to recover.</p>
<p>John Williams concludes that in current BLS reporting, “the aggregate  average overstatement of employment change easily exceeds 200,000 jobs  per month.”</p>
<p>In other words, the economy did not gain 288,000 new jobs last month.    But let’s assume the economy did gain 288,000 jobs and exam where the  claimed jobs are reported to be.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/familysurvival.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 0em;margin-left: 1em"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ASIFGy_z7zU/UCFiDQK8GBI/AAAAAAAAROU/7AHejVY_hUE/s202/3.gif"></a>Of the alleged 288,000 new jobs, 16,000, or 5.5 percent are in  manufacturing, which is not very promising for engineers and blue collar  workers.  Growth in goods producing jobs has almost disappeared from  the US economy.  As explained below, to alter this problem the  government is going to change definitions in order to artificially  inflate manufacturing jobs.</p>
<p>In June private services account for 82 percent of the supposed new  jobs.  The jobs are found mainly in non-tradable domestic services that  pay little and cannot be exported to help to close the large US trade  deficit.</p>
<p>Wholesale and retail trade account for 55,300 jobs.  Do you believe  sales are this strong  when retailers are closing stores and when  shopping malls are closing?</p>
<p>Insurance (most likely the paperwork of Obamacare) contributed 8,500 jobs.</p>
<p>As so few can purchase homes, “real estate rental and leasing” contributed 8,500 jobs.</p>
<p>Professional and business services contributed 67,000 jobs, but 57%  of these jobs were in employment services, temporary help services, and  services to buildings and dwellings.</p>
<p>That old standby, education and health services, accounted for 33,700  jobs consisting mainly of ambulatory health care services jobs and  social assistance jobs of which three-quarters are in child day care  services.</p>
<p>The other old standby, waitresses and bartenders, gave us 32,800  jobs, and amusements, gambling, and recreation gave us 3,500 jobs.</p>
<p>Local government, principally education, gave us 22,000 jobs.</p>
<p>So, where are the jobs for university graduates?  They are  practically non-existent. Think of all the MBAs, but June had only 2,300  jobs for management of companies and enterprises.</p>
<p>Think of the struggle to get into law and medical schools.  There’s  no job payoff. June had jobs for 1,200 in legal services, which includes  receptionists and para-legals.  Where are all the law school graduates  finding jobs?</p>
<p>Offices of physicians (mainly people who fill out the mandated  paperwork and comply with all the regulations, which have multiplied  under ObamaCare) hired 4,000 people.  Outpatient care centers hired 700  people.  Nursing care facilities hired 2,400 people.  So where are the  jobs for the medical school graduates?</p>
<p>Aside from all the exaggerations in the jobs numbers of which  ShadowStats.com has informed us, just taking the jobs as reported, what  kind of economy do these jobs indicate:  a superpower whose pretensions  are to exercise hegemony over the world or an economy in which  opportunities are disappearing and incomes are falling?</p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>Do you think that this jobs picture would be the same if the government in Washington cared about you instead of the mega-rich?</p>
<p>Some interesting numbers can be calculated from table A.9 in the BLS  press release.  John Williams advises that the BLS is inconsistent in  the methods it uses to tabulate the data in table A.9 and that the data  is also afflicted by seasonal adjustment problems.  However, as the  unemployment rate and payroll jobs are reported regardless of their  problems, we can also report the <i>BLS finding that in June 523,000 full-time jobs disappeared and 800,000 part time jobs appeared.</i><br />
<i><br />
</i><br />
Here, perhaps, we have yet another downside of the misnamed Obama  “Affordable Care Act.” Employers are terminating full-time employment  and replacing the jobs with part-time employment in order to come in  under the 50-person full time employment that makes employers  responsible for fringe benefits such as health care.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bloggersecret.com/" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 0em;margin-left: 1em"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-W_QDsMeuL2M/T8kFjUwCVXI/AAAAAAAAPEk/RT2DHTDyOsI/s300/300x250_v002.gif" width="200"></a>Americans are already experiencing difficulties making ends meet,  despite the alleged “recovery.”  If yet another half million Americans  have been forced onto part-time pay with consequent loss of health care  and other benefits, consumer demand is further compressed, with the  consequence, unless hidden by statistical trickery, of a 2nd quarter  negative GDP and thus officially the reappearance of recession.</p>
<p>What will the government do if a recession cannot be hidden?  If  years of unprecedented money printing and Keynesian fiscal deficits have  not brought recovery, what will bring recovery?  How far down will US  living standards fall for the 99% in order that the 1% can become ever  more mega-rich while Washington wastes our diminishing substance  exercising hegemony over the world?</p>
<p>Just as Washington lied to you about Saddam Hussein’s weapons of mass  destruction, Assad’s use of chemical weapons, Russian invasion of  Ukraine, Waco, and any number of false flag or nonexistent attacks such  as Tonkin Gulf, Washington lies to you about jobs and economic recovery.   Don’t believe the spin that you are unemployed because you are  shiftless and prefer government handouts to work.  The government does  not want you to know that you are unemployed because the corporations  offshored American jobs to foreigners and because economic policy only  serves the oversized banks and the one percent.</p>

<p>Just as the jobs and inflation numbers are rigged and the financial markets are rigged, <i>the  corrupt Obama regime is now planning to rig US manufacturing and trade  statistics in order to bury all evidence of offshoring’s adverse impact  on our economy. </i></p>
<p>The federal governments Economic Classification Policy Committee has  come up with a proposal to redefine fact as fantasy in order to hide  offshoring’s contribution to the US trade deficit, artificially inflate  the number of US manufacturing jobs, and redefine foreign-made  manufactured products as US manufactured products.  For example, Apple  iPhones made in China and sold in Europe would be reported as a US  export of manufactured goods. Read Ben Beachy’s important report on this  blatant statistical fraud in CounterPunch’s July 4th weekend edition: <a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/2014/07/04/we-didnt-offshore-manufacturing/" target="_blank">http://www.counterpunch.org/2014/07/04/we-didnt-offshore-manufacturing/</a></p>
<p>
China will not agree that the Apple brand name means that the phones are  not Chinese production. If the Obama regime succeeds with this fraud,  the iPhones would be counted twice, once by China and once by the US,  and the double-counting would exaggerate world GDP.</p>
<p>For years I have exposed the absurd claim that offshoring is merely  the operation of free trade, and I have exposed the incompetent studies  by such as Michael Porter at Harvard and Matthew Slaughter at Dartmouth  that claimed to prove that the US was benefitting from offshoring its  manufacturing.  My book published in 2012 in Germany and in 2013 in the  US, <i>The Failure of Laissez Faire Capitalism and Economic Dissolution of the West</i>,  proves that offshoring has dismantled the ladders of upward mobility  that made the US an opportunity society and is responsible for the  decline in US economic growth. The lost jobs and decline in the middle  class has contributed to the rise in income inequality, the destruction  of tax base for cities and states, and loss of population in America’s  once great manufacturing centers.</p>
<p>For the most part economists have turned a blind eye. Economists serve the globalists.  It pays them well.</p>
<p>The corruption in present-day America is total. Psychologists and  anthropologists serve war and torture. Economists serve globalism and US  financial hegemony. Physicists and chemists serve the war industries.  Physicists and computer geeks serve NSA. The media serves the government  and the corporations. The political parties serve the six powerful  private interest groups that rule the country.</p>
<p>No one serves truth and liberty.</p>
<p>I predict that within ten years truth and liberty will be forbidden  words uttered only by “domestic extremists” who are a threat that must  be exterminated without due process of law.</p>
<p>America has left us.  We now have the tyranny of the Orwellian state  that rules, not by the ballot box and Constitution, but by force and  propaganda.</p>

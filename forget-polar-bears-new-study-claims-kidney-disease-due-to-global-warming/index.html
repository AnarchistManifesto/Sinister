<p>In a move that serves as a reminder of the prevalence of lack of integrity within the Western medical industry, as well as the commitment to federally funded non-scientific political propaganda, Dr. Richard Johnson researcher at University of Colorado Anschutz has recently declared that a rare kidney disease observed in Central American sugar cane worker is caused by, get this, “<a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-10/uoca-mdm100815.php" target="blank">global warming.</a>”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“This could be the first epidemic directly caused by global warming,” said Johnson, professor of medicine at the University of Colorado School of Medicine and a world-renowned expert on the underlying causes of obesity, kidney disease, diabetes and hypertension. “Some districts of Nicaragua have been called the ‘land of widows’ due to the high mortality rates occurring among the male workers from chronic kidney disease.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This latest shockingly dishonest and almost laughable medical political claim serves to remind us that modern-day Western medicine and politically funded government “scientists” will stop at nothing to promote the agendas of their masters who apparently now go well beyond just the pharmaceutical industry.</p>

<p>This is at least the second of a series of recent federally funded “scientific” claims attempting to link global warming somehow to medical diseases. None of these claims are based on proven experiments or evidence-based medicine, but on pre-determined political goals that look to link global warming theories into sectors of life never before tried. Perhaps this is because the “polar bears are dying” disinformation campaign of the past decades ran its course. Or because the “melting glaciers” claims never gained enough traction for their liking.</p>
<p>The fact is that any MD or scientist who puts their names behind these political claims without any solid reproducible scientific evidence only serves to further remind us of the corruption that permeates science and medicine today. I exposed an earlier attempt this year (2015) of another politically funded “study” suggesting a link between CO2 emissions and heart disease, hypertension, respiratory illness and premature death. The study, intended to sell the need for a future global carbon tax and new mechanism of behavior control, was spread by mainstream media suggesting there was evidence that decreasing CO2 emissions could “<a href="http://truthandarttv.com/climate-change-psyop-new-study-decreasing-co2-emissions-will-save-thousands-of-lives" target="blank">save thousands of lives.</a>”</p>

Everyone knows this. I absolutely believe climate change is real. My first response to this is the climate is <em>supposed</em> to change, at least over a long period of time. Long-term change is natural. Anyone can study historic temperature charts and see that temperature and climates have changed throughout history. Short-term climate on the other hand should show some reasonable stability.</p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>However, when a powerful military industrial complex operating in secret and patenting all their plans for <a class="easyazon-link" href="https://www.activistpost.com/product/B007JDN7EM/US/permacultucom-20/?cart=y" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">permanent weather modification</a> (and thus control) is allowed to operate with full immunity from criminal prosecution, you get what we have today in 2015.</p>
<p>We have over a decade of heavy-duty, daily geoengineering of our skies. Chemtrails planes and other power plant <a href="http://weatherwar101.com/" target="blank">cooling tower</a> methods are regularly now used to spray and inject mixtures of artificial clouds and nano-metal particles into the atmosphere, all for the purposes of manipulating the climate and other likely purposes. We have over a solid decade of these contaminants and toxins sprayed into the sky and causing dimming of the sunlight that has been trying to reach the earth, causing alterations of the moisture in our atmosphere, and depositing dangerous toxic metal particles all over the ocean, the soil and all of the ecosystem tampering with the system’s pH and nutrient availability. We must face the reality that we have a dangerously and deliberately tampered ecosystem, all the while federally and UN/IPCC funded groups continue to attribute climate change strictly to CO2 emissions as it relates to Al Gore anthropogenic global warming theories debunked many times over.</p>
<p>This single partial truth of climate change versus acknowledging the true root cause is what I call the “Building 7” of the climate change movement. Climate activists are too comfortable in their climate movement in the same way that people find comfort in the 9/11 official story. Having to acknowledge geoengineering seems to be as painful as having to acknowledge the controlled demolition of WTC 7. Both are paradigm disrupting and both force the person who thinks of themselves as reasonable and well intended to take a second look at their own beliefs.</p>
<p>We have a stubborn generation of liberals and climate activists forever stuck on Al Gore’s CO2 lies, all the while they conveniently and willfully ignore global undeniable geoengineering crimes. Even worse, as they wallow in willful ignorance about the catastrophic engineered climate change we are all witnessing, they don’t realize that the “CO2” problem being presented by the highest level of the UN, federal governments and the mainstream media is a scheme for permanent global enslavement as reflected in <a class="easyazon-link" href="https://www.activistpost.com/product/B006OCWHCW/US/permacultucom-20/?cart=y" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Agenda 21</a>, Agenda 2030 and the models of “sustainable” living they continue to paint this as.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center"><a href="http://activistpost.net/batteries.html" target="_blank">Never buy another battery again (Ad)</a></h4>
<p>They refuse to see the history of the climate movement in the correct context that I’m describing here. I’m talking about the dark history of the movement that shows how the global elite planned to use the climate religion as an ace in the hole to roll out global governance. We are now seeing the global government ceremonies and stated goals every day in the news. The recently declared Agenda 2030 by the U.N., and those pushing the new world order offer us a glimpse of the desired end result they seek.</p>
<p>So what does all of this have to do with a climate change funded doctor at the University of Colorado Anschutz suddenly claiming that a newly discovered kidney disease is caused by global warming? Everything, because this is a continuation of the ongoing deception and lack of integrity in government-funded science whose peddlers are always willing to offer conclusions to studies without any actual evidence whatsoever, so long as the conclusion supports the stated agendas. Let’s examine Dr. Johnson’s claims.<img src="http://affiliates.naturalnews.com/scripts/imp.php?a_aid=TruthandArt&amp;a_bid=b9b40237" alt="" width="1" height="1"></p>
<p>Dr. Johnson says the new study observes that over 20,000 sugar cane workers in Central America died of kidney failure. He says many of them had high uric acid levels (also known as <a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/241767-overview" target="blank">hyperuricemia</a>) and suffered from chronic dehydration. For the sake of lay people and in the interest of condensed clarity, let me say that elevated uric acid levels or hyperuricemia and chronic kidney disease can be caused by many factors. Kidney failure will cause high uric acid levels and many factors can cause kidney failure with subsequent elevated uric acid levels. To name a few: diabetes, gout, infection, autoimmune or unknown inflammatory process, polycystic disease, genetic and other acquired metabolic disorders can all lead to kidney failure of one kind or another.</p>
<p>In this recent study Dr. Johnson scientifically explains the observed correlation between dehydration and high levels of uric acid as well as high sugar intake and kidney tubular damage. Nothing wrong with this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“There has been a marked increase in intake of sugary beverages throughout the world,” Johnson said. “Fructose, present in soft drinks, can induce tubular injury in laboratory animals.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But then at the very end of his presentation (watch video <a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/multimedia/pub/100899.php?from=308452" target="blank">here</a>) he shockingly declares a wild assumption with no evidence whatsoever:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I believe it is an epidemic related to global warming…</p>

<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/familysurvival.html" rel="nofollow"><img class="alignright" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-wNo87rwTkak/T_Nf058z13I/AAAAAAAAQUg/zfQlS8HQtiw/s270/150x270.gif" alt=""></a>Note that Dr. Johnson could have left it at saying that their may be a link between kidney failure and prolonged dehydration and or high sugar intake and that would have been reasonable. Instead, he makes a leap outside of the realm of evidence-based medicine and into reputation-damaging political propaganda by saying he “believes” (not “the evidence shows”) that this epidemic “is” (not “may be”) related to global warming. Well-trained, evidence-based ethical scientists and especially medical doctors just don’t normally speak this way.</p>
<p>This is a shocking assertion coming from a medical doctor who claims to presumably be a scientist and a researcher of integrity. Notice also he specifically says “global warming” not “climate change,” so let’s deal with these claims in the intended context.</p>
<p>IPCC themselves would disagree with Dr. Johnson since as <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2425775/Climate-scientists-told-cover-fact-Earths-temperature-risen-15-years.html" target="blank">reported</a> in 2013 their 2000-page climate report admitted that earth had not been warming as they expected for over 14 years. Again, did Dr. Johnson accidentally say “global warming” instead of “climate change”? Did he forget that global warming is out and climate change is in? Either way it only goes to show you the lack of integrity demonstrated by parties who take government grant money to conduct studies that somehow point back to global warming, climate change or whatever agenda the controllers want to push while ignoring their own crimes.</p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>There are many other explanations and questions Dr. Johnson can pose given the details of this study. Did civilizations in the Medieval warm period or any civilizations of the past ever suffer from the “global warming” kidney disease?  Since cold weather can cause dehydration as well, can global cooling also cause kidney disease? Given the myriad possible reasons for any group of people in any culture or region developing chronic kidney disease did Dr. Johnson’s team rule out long-term chronic infectious or inflammatory process? Genetic disorder? Diet? Environmental toxins? What direct evidence was there for specifically claiming that global warming was causing kidney disease prior to this study?? Are there no other causes of dehydration? Why not consider direct causes of dehydration rather than a political myth created by Al Gore? When the time comes to state this newly discovered evidence to the world Dr Johnson says “I believe” it is … related to global warming. The “I believe” statement thus acts as an advertisement for the movement and ultimately for the 2030 agenda at play for global domination. That is as scientifically convincing as saying I believe you should buy this car or I believe you should drink Coca-Cola.</p>
<p>This is another reminder that we are living in a time when truth and integrity means nothing to many corrupt scientists and doctors who only care about money and power. To them the only thing that matters is what you can get people to believe. And there is a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/2014_R&amp;Dbudget_climate.pdf" target="blank">money tree</a> of government funding designed to filter money through to all of the organizations that are willing to <a href="http://www.aaas.org/news/aaas-receives-noaa-and-nasa-funding-develop-climate-literacy-materials" target="blank">support</a> global warming claims. This story was promoted by the American Association for the Advancement of Science or AAAS who admittedly receives “NOAA and NASA funding to develop Climate Literacy Materials.”</p>

<p>Consider that we never heard the mention of medical conditions linked to global warming prior to this year (2015) recent propaganda campaign. Now we’re being slowly and regularly subjected to “new” claims that have absolutely no scientific bases whatsoever and bought-and-paid-for medical <a href="http://www.ajkd.org/" target="blank">journals</a> are right there ready to play along.</p>
<p>No one should be fooled by these bought-and-paid-for doctors and scientists who are now putting out statements of scientific conclusions as if their opinion IS the science. The journals then follow right in line and publish these studies with arbitrary conclusions. This process alone gives the study an aura of legitimacy. Then the following three words are the most powerful part of the psyop. The three words we hear all the time to psyop the general public into digesting the propaganda is: “A new study” … shows that or says that …</p>
<p>If you agree with this assessment please share this information so that people will become increasingly skeptical of these shameless anti-science political claims now being pushed by journals, scientists and now even medical doctors. These so-called scientists don’t deserve the respect of the true scientific and medical community and restoring the scientific integrity to science and medicine starts here.</p>

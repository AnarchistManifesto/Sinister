<p>The US government is on a shutdown due to the failure of Congress to reach consensus about illegal immigration. Upping the ante, Trump has released an ad concerning murders committed by illegal immigrants, focusing on Luis Bracamontes, charged in the 2014 killings of two police officers in Sacramento, California. The ad shows a leering Bracamontes stating, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-nm0vQwO5c">“The only thing that I %&amp;$#** regret is that I %&amp;$#** just killed two.”</a></p>
<p>While crimes committed by illegal immigrants or anyone else is a matter of grave concern, one might also want to take a hard look at what sort of murders are being funded by the government.</p>
<p><strong>MURDERS ABROAD</strong></p>
<p>The Trump administration has loosened the Obama-era rules on drone strikes, allowing the CIA to expand its foreign targets to include foot soldiers and others without skills or leadership status. As a result, Trump’s estimated civilian kills in war-torn countries far exceed Obama’s. <a href="http://thefreethoughtproject.com/trump-killed-more-civilians-obama/">As reported here</a>, in just nine months Trump’s estimated civilian deaths due to drone strikes were 4,500. In eight years in office, Obama’s total civilian death toll due to drones was estimated at from 2,300 to 3,400.</p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p><strong>MURDERS AT HOME</strong></p>
<p>Let’s take a look at domestic kills. That would be American citizens killed by government forces within the US. <a href="http://www.killedbypolice.net/">According to Killedbypolice</a>, which tracks police murders through media reports, 1188 people were killed by law enforcement in 2017. An additional 68 people have been killed by police since January 1 of 2018.</p>
<p>The Bureau of Justice Statistics maintains records of inmates who die while in jail or prison. A recent BJS report states that from 2001 to 2013, a total of 42,157 died while in state prison. Most of these deaths were reportedly due to illness. Suicide accounted for 2577 of these deaths, while accidents were listed as causing 411 deaths and homicides, 762. The total number of jail deaths listed for the year 2013 was 967, with 34% of these reported as suicides. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2015/07/23/how-often-do-prisoners-die-behind-bars/?utm_term=.bfa2fe229049">As noted in the <em>Washington Post</em></a>, “More than 70 percent of the inmates who died in local jails were not convicted at the time they died.”  A number of questions have been raised concerning the suicide deaths.</p>
<p><strong>MURDERS OF PEOPLE IN NURSING HOMES</strong></p>
<p>There are extra-judicial murders funded by our government which are not reported as such. There is no website tracking the murders of the elderly in nursing homes or hospitals, no Government Accountability Office reports detailing these deaths, although the anecdotal reports are increasing in number. Recently, in Hollywood, Florida, <a href="http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/hollywood-nursing-home-hurricane-deaths/fl-sb-nursing-home-homicides-official-20171122-story.html">twelve nursing home deaths were ruled to be homicides</a>, a stunning departure from the fact that most nursing home deaths are not investigated and when they are, <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2013/07/questions-arise-as-to-coroners-cover-up.html">as in the case of Charles Castle</a>, a cover-up often ensues.  Family members who report concerns of the fate of parents or friends under a court-authorized adult guardianship often find themselves under a gag order, as was Janet Pipes in Arizona, Ginny Johnson in North Carolina and a multitude of others. These gag orders mandate jail time for those who persevere in making such reports. Others, such as Debra Ashby, whose father is under a guardianship in California, are sued for alleged “defamation.”</p>
<p>A request for precautionary measures for Ashby’s father, Leon Bridges, <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2017/10/human-rights-group-files-groundbreaking-document-oas-commission-states-no-justice-guardianship-proceedings.html">has been filed by the human rights group Ku’untik with the Inter- American Commission on Human Rights</a>, which has yet to take action.  The guardian is now suing Ashby for a cool million, citing harm to his reputation.</p>
<p><strong>“BLACK PROJECT” MURDERS</strong></p>
<p>A “black project” involving doppelganger pharmaceuticals ensures the death under “plausible deniability” of a target–elderly, political or you name it. Numerous attempts have been made to turn these doppelganger or imposter pharmaceuticals over to regulatory agencies, including the Chemical Weapons Convention at the Hague and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. Thus far, all agencies contacted have refused to accept any evidence that heart attack drugs are now being disguised as Big Pharma pills and dispensed to unsuspecting individuals.</p>
<p>As discussed <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2016/02/falling-from-high-places.html">in this article</a> and elsewhere, a disturbing number of people who had access to classified information have fallen to their deaths.  Others, such as inventor Stanley Meyer, were poisoned. A growing number of American citizens, as well as others across the globe, are now stating that unconventional weapons are being tested on them. These weapons include microwave and directed energy weapons as well as chemical and biological weapons.</p>
<p>When individuals first started coming forward with these claims, they were largely dismissed as “tin foil hats” and mentally deranged. However, these claims have gained momentum and credence and those who are now alleging such weapons testing include a number of former government agents,such as ex-NSA employees Bill Binney and Karen Stewart and former FBI agent Geral Sosbee, <a href="https://www.biggerthansnowden.com/">among others</a>.  The entire “tin foil hat” designation took a major hit when recent news reports detailed that these <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/14/mystery-of-sonic-weapon-attacks-at-us-embassy-in-cuba-deepens">very same weapons had been trained on US Embassy personnel in Cuba</a>.</p>
<p>Karen Stewart, who served as an analyst with the NSA for 28 years before stumbling upon what she terms an illegal blackmail operation within the NSA itself, now sleeps in a self-styled bunker, with shielding to protect her from unconventional weapons attacks. Recent medical reports show heart and brain irregularities, including internal bleeding, which appear to have been caused by the directed energy bombardment. Her pet cat, Yoshi, recently succumbed after the frequency of attacks ramped up and a pet dog has now been diagnosed with fatal cancer.</p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

</div>
<p>Writes Stewart,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>….right now America and much of the world is being covertly destroyed by the unelected, mentally and morally rabid within the Deep State holding our government hostage with their secret army of hand-picked civilian sociopaths and “extermination technicians” from the utter dregs of humanity, hired and trained under the guise of National Security.” Ironically, she points out that these technicians are funded by taxpayer monies “earmarked for our protection.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And this brings us to the nut of the issue. As long as the dollars–<em><strong>our</strong></em> dollars–continue to flow to support attacks on us, be they through trigger-happy police who are not prosecuted for their actions, through judges who routinely ignore the law in order to funnel more warm bodies into predatory guardianships or through intelligence assets who are self enriching through high-tech attacks on innocent people, we will likely continue to experience more of the same.</p>
<p>So while the US government is on shutdown, it might be fruitful to revisit the purpose of government, which is to protect its citizens. Certainly the issue of illegal immigration deserves critical attention. We don’t want to give harbor to illegal criminal elements who will rape, rob or kill us. Nor should we be funding police, medical institutions, courts or intelligence agents to do the same.</p>

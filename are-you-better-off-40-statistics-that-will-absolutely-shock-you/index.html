<b><a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2012/09/are-you-better-off-40-statistics-that.html" target="_blank">Activist Post</a></b></p>
<p>Are you better off today than you were four years ago?  This is a question that comes up nearly every election.  This year the Romney campaign has even created a Twitter hashtag for it: <a href="https://twitter.com/i/#!/search/realtime/%23AreYouBetterOff">#AreYouBetterOff</a>.  The Democrats are making lots of speeches claiming that we are better off, and the Republicans are making lots of speeches claiming that we are not.  So are most Americans actually better off than they were four years ago?  Of course not.</p>
<p>One recent poll found that only <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/05/us/politics/better-off-its-less-clear-than-in-1980-campaign.html?pagewanted=all">20 percent</a> of Americans believe that they are better off financially than they were four years ago.  But the same thing was true four years ago as well.  Our economy has been in decline and the middle class has been shrinking for a very long time.  The Democrats want to put all of the blame on the Republicans for this, and the Republicans want to put all of the blame on the Democrats for this.  A recent CNN headline defiantly declared the following: “<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/09/04/opinion/granderson-middle-class/index.html">Decline of middle class not Obama’s fault</a>“, and this is the kind of thing we are going to hear day after day until the election in November.  But obviously something has gone fundamentally wrong with our economy.  So who should we blame?</p>
<p>Sadly, you hear very little on the mainstream news networks or the talk radio shows about the institution that has the most power over our economy.  <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/category/federal-reserve">The Federal Reserve</a> has far more power over our financial system than anyone else does, but the media and both political parties tell us that the Federal Reserve is “above politics” and that their “independence” must never be questioned.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>But the truth is that the debt-based financial system that the Federal Reserve is at the core of is absolutely central to our economic problems.  If you do not understand this, please see this article: “<a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/10-things-that-every-american-should-know-about-the-federal-reserve">10 Things That Every American Should Know About The Federal Reserve</a>“.</p>
<div align="center">
</div>
<p>
The Federal Reserve has done more to mess up our economy than anyone else has.</p>
<p>So shouldn’t they be held accountable?</p>
<p>That is a very good question.</p>
<p>Have you ever wondered why financial markets move so dramatically whenever Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke gives a speech?</p>
<p>The same thing does not happen when Barack Obama gives a speech.</p>
<p>That is because the financial markets know who holds the real power in our financial system.</p>
<p>But during this election season the American people are told to put all of their attention on the “red team” and the “blue team”.  We are told that the two major political parties are philosophical opposites and that they want to take the United States is two completely different directions.</p>
<p>The “true believers” on the blue team are completely and totally convinced that Barack Obama will be able to rescue the economy and save America.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/ultimatesurvivalplan.html" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-CTsdDqKcvhI/T7GjToaksaI/AAAAAAAAO2s/8vEb9HmqOhk/s316/160x316.gif"></a>The “true believers” on the red team are completely and totally convinced that Mitt Romney will be able to rescue the economy and save America.</p>
<p>Once upon a time I was one of those political activists.  I was fully convinced that America could be turned around if we could just get enough Republicans into office.</p>
<p>But then I noticed that nothing really seemed to change no matter who was in power.  I became disillusioned as I realized that Republicans were doing things pretty much the exact same way that Democrats were doing them when they got into power.</p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>Yes, there are some minor differences between the two parties on taxes and regulations. If we elect one guy over the other our economy might decline at a slightly different pace. But in the end both political parties are taking us to the exact same place. Down the toilet.</p>
<p>I wish that wasn’t true. But we need to be honest with ourselves….</p>
<ul>
<li>Both parties fully support the Federal Reserve.</li>
<li>Both parties supported the nomination of Ben Bernanke to a second term as the head of the Federal Reserve.</li>
<li>Both parties endlessly push <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/22-stats-that-show-how-the-emerging-one-world-economy-is-absolutely-killing-american-workers">the job-killing “free trade” agenda</a> of the global elite.</li>
<li>Both parties see nothing wrong with running absolutely enormous trade deficits with the rest of the world.</li>
<li>Both parties supported TARP.</li>
<li>Both parties supported the “economic stimulus” packages.</li>
<li>Both parties supported the auto industry bailouts.</li>
<li>Both parties have run up massive amounts of federal debt when in power.</li>
<li>Both parties have greatly expanded the size of the federal government when in power.</li>
<li>Both parties are full of control freaks and both parties have added more layers of <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/19-examples-of-how-control-freaks-are-killing-america-with-their-completely-ridiculous-regulations">ridiculous regulations</a> to our already overburdened society when in power.</li>
<li>Neither party supports getting rid of the income tax or the IRS.</li>
<li>Neither party has any intention of doing anything to prevent <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/the-coming-derivatives-crisis-that-could-destroy-the-entire-global-financial-system">the coming derivatives crisis</a> that could bring down the entire global financial system.</li>
<li>Both parties are absolutely showered with cash from the big Wall Street banks.</li>
<li>Both parties think that the TSA is doing a great job.</li>
<li>Both parties supported the NDAA and the renewal of the Patriot Act.</li>
<li>Both parties have greatly expanded the <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/14-incredibly-creepy-surveillance-technologies-that-big-brother-will-soon-be-using-to-spy-on-you">unconstitutional surveillance</a> of American citizens by government agencies.</li>
<li>Both parties are extremely soft on illegal immigration.</li>
<li>Both parties have treated military veterans <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/why-does-the-u-s-government-treat-military-veterans-like-human-garbage">horribly</a>.</li>
<li>Both parties are absolutely packed with corrupt politicians that are living the high life <a href="http://thetruthwins.com/archives/16-sickening-facts-that-show-how-members-of-congress-and-federal-workers-are-living-the-high-life-at-your-expense">at your expense</a>.</li>
<li>Neither party plans to balance the federal budget in 2013 if their candidate wins the election.</li>
<li>Neither party has a plan that will fix our <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/83046-for-a-3-hour-hospital-visit-why-are-hospital-bills-so-outrageous">deeply broken</a> health care system.</li>
<li>Neither party has any plans to shut down the Federal Reserve.  In fact, both parties see absolutely nothing wrong with our current system.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course this list could go on indefinitely, but hopefully you get the point.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/familysurvival.html" style="float: right;margin-left: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ASIFGy_z7zU/UCFiDQK8GBI/AAAAAAAAROU/7AHejVY_hUE/s202/3.gif"></a>But I can understand those that are deeply frustrated with Barack Obama and that desperately want to avoid another four years of his policies.</p>
<p>I also believe that Barack Obama has been the worst president in U.S. history and that he and his entire cabinet should immediately resign in disgrace.</p>
<p>However, the Republican party foolishly chose to nominate the Republican candidate that was most like Barack Obama to run against him.</p>
<p>That was an enormous mistake.</p>
<p>No matter what the talk radio shows are telling you, the truth is that this country will continue on pretty much the same path no matter who wins the election.</p>
<p>I know that statement is going to make a lot of people angry.  But it is the sad reality of what we are facing.</p>
<p>Even if you focus on just the economy, the truth is that Mitt Romney’s “five point plan” is <a href="http://www.policymic.com/articles/13940/if-you-liked-romney-s-5-point-plan-vote-for-obama">almost exactly the same thing</a> that Barack Obama has been saying.</p>
<p>Many Americans believe that since Mitt Romney made lots of money on Wall Street conducting leveraged buyouts of vulnerable corporations that he understands how to fix our economy.</p>
<p>Sadly, that is not the truth.</p>
<p>I have listened to many Romney speeches about the economy and I keep waiting for some pearls of wisdom, but I have found that he is just as clueless about the economy as our other recent presidents have been.</p>
<p>Look, I know that there are a lot of people out there that have good hearts that want to have someone that they can believe in. They want to believe that things can get better. They want to have hope. And I don’t blame them for that.</p>
<p>I just think that it is time to pull our heads out of the sand and realize that things are not going to be getting any better.</p>
<p>A political savior on a white horse is not going to come riding in to save the day.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.offgridoutpost.com/survival-packs.html#a_aid=activistpost&amp;a_bid=7b9a5561" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em" target="_blank"><img alt="" height="300" src="http://offgridoutpost.postaffiliatepro.com/accounts/default1/banners/200x300_FamilySurivalPacks_01-1.png" title="" width="200"></a>So by this point in the article a whole lot of Democrats and a whole lot of Republicans are very upset with me. But I am not against you.  There is way too much hate in our society today.  Even if we disagree with someone else we can still love them.</p>
<p>I just think that it is very important that we understand that there is not going to be a solution to our problems on the national level and that our economy is headed for collapse no matter who gets elected.</p>
<p>The total amount of debt in the United States has risen from less than 2 trillion dollars to nearly 55 trillion dollars over the past 40 years, and there is nothing that Barack Obama or Mitt Romney can do to prevent the “correction” that is coming.</p>
<p>So are Americans better off than they were four years ago?</p>
<p>Of course not.</p>
<p>But things will soon get a whole lot worse no matter how the election turns out.</p>
<p>The following are 40 statistics that will absolutely shock you….</p>
<p><b>#1</b> During the time Barack Obama has been in the White House, median household income has fallen <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/peterferrara/2012/09/02/obamas-accelerating-downward-spiral-for-america/">by 7.3 percent</a>.</p>
<p><b>#2</b> Back in 2007, <a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2012/08/midclass_decline_chart.html">19.2 percent</a> of all American families had a net worth of zero or less than zero.

<p><b>#4</b> According to the Pew Research Center, 61 percent of all Americans were “middle income” back in 1971.  Today, only <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2012/08/22/news/economy/middle-class-pew/index.html">51 percent</a> of all Americans are “middle income”.</p>
<p><b>#5</b> Back in 1970, middle income Americans brought home 62 percent of all income in the United States.

<p><b>#6</b> The unemployment rate in the United States has been above 8 percent <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2199362/Obama-tells-Americans-You-absolutely-better-years-ago.html?ito=feeds-newsxml">for 42 straight months</a>.</p>

<p><b>#9</b> Approximately <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/47133762">53 percent</a> of all U.S. college graduates under the age of 25 were either <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/53-percent-of-all-young-college-graduates-in-america-are-either-unemployed-or-underemployed">unemployed or underemployed</a> last year.</p>
<p><b>#10</b> Since Barack Obama entered the White House, the number of long-term unemployed Americans has risen <a href="http://www.republican.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/our-view?ID=e33a7a58-66d2-4491-91f6-aae703cdb370">from 2.7 million to 5.2 million</a>.</p>

<p><b>#18</b> While Barack Obama has been president the velocity of money has plunged <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/M2V/">to a post-World War II low</a>.<br />
<b><br />

<p><b>#20</b> Electricity bills in the United States have risen faster than the overall rate of inflation <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/energy/story/2011-12-13/electric-bills/51840042/1?loc=interstitialskip">for five years in a row</a>.</p>

<p><b>#24</b> As I wrote about <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/83046-for-a-3-hour-hospital-visit-why-are-hospital-bills-so-outrageous">yesterday</a>, back in 1980 less than 10 percent of U.S. GDP was spent on health care but now about <a href="http://www.moneycrashers.com/expensive-healthcare-affects-americans/">18 percent</a> of U.S. GDP goes toward health care.</p>
<p><b>#25</b> In a <a href="http://thetruthwins.com/archives/84-statistics-that-prove-that-the-decline-of-the-middle-class-is-real-and-that-it-is-getting-worse">previous article</a>, I noted that 62 percent of all middle class Americans say that they have had to <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/08/22/middle-class-suffers-worst-decade-in-modern-history-report-says/">reduce household spending</a> over the past year.</p>
<p><b>#26</b> Family budgets in America are being stretched to the breaking point.

<p><b>#28</b> More than three times as many new homes were sold in the United States <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/HSN1FNSA">in 2005</a> as will be sold in 2012.</p>
<p><b>#29</b> The United States was once ranked #1 in the world in GDP per capita.  Today we have slipped <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2004rank.html">to #11</a>.</p>
<p><b>#30</b> Since Barack Obama <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/18-statistics-that-prove-that-the-economy-has-not-improved-since-barack-obama-became-the-president-of-the-united-states">became president</a>, the number of Americans living in poverty has risen by 6.4 million.</p>
<p><b>#31</b> The number of Americans on food stamps has grown from about 17 million in the year 2000 to 31.9 million when Barack Obama entered the White House to <a href="http://www.fns.usda.gov/pd/34snapmonthly.htm">46.7 million</a> today.</p>

<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/stirlinggenerator.html" style="float: right;margin-left: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-J4xHp_BRR6k/UCGNstMMDZI/AAAAAAAARPc/H486-97BsBg/s200/ad2200.jpg" alt=""></a><b>#34</b> It is estimated that child homelessness in the United States has risen by <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/story/2011-12-12/homeless-children-increase/51851146/1">33 percent</a> since 2007.</p>
<p><b>#35</b> Back in 1965, only one out of every 50 Americans was on Medicaid.  Today, <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/mary-meeker-usa-inc-february-24-2011-2">approximately one out of every 6</a> Americans is on Medicaid.</p>
<p><b>#36</b> As I wrote about <a href="http://thetruthwins.com/archives/11-signs-that-the-u-s-health-care-system-is-heading-straight-down-the-toilet">the other day</a>, it is being projected that Obamacare will add <a href="http://news.investors.com/Article.aspx?id=598993&amp;ibdbot=1&amp;p=2">16 million more Americans</a> to the Medicaid rolls.</p>
<p><b>#37</b> It is being projected that the number of Americans on Medicare will grow from 50.7 million in 2012 to <a href="http://theweek.com/article/index/231267/is-america-running-out-of-doctors">73.2 million</a> in 2025.</p>

<b><a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2013/09/thanks-to-obamacare-employer-based.html">Activist Post</a></b></p>
<p>Barack Obama promised to fundamentally transform America, and when it  comes to health care he has definitely kept his promise.  Thanks to  Obamacare, health care spending is up, health insurance premiums are up,  the number of hours Americans are working is down and employer-based  health insurance is becoming an endangered species.  Of course  employer-based health insurance will not disappear completely any time  soon, but it has been steadily shrinking for over a decade, and  Obamacare will greatly accelerate that decline.</p>
<p>If you go back to 1999,  <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/poverty-in-america-2012-9#people-by-type-of-health-insurance-coverage-1999-to-2011-11" target="_blank" title="64.1 percent">64.1 percent</a> of all Americans were covered by employment-based health insurance.  That was pretty good.  Today, only <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2013/09/17/news/economy/health-insurance-census/index.html?iid=HP_LN" target="_blank" title="54.9 percent">54.9 percent</a>  of all Americans are covered by employment-based health insurance, and  now thousands upon thousands of U.S. employers are considering reducing  the scope of the health plans they offer to employees or eliminating  them altogether due to Obamacare.  If you are thinking that this sounds  like a potential nightmare for millions of Americans families, you would  be exactly right.</p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p><a name="more"></a>There have already been widespread reports of companies dropping  health insurance, but nobody knows for sure how widespread the carnage  will be.  According to <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-03-08/why-your-employer-may-drop-your-health-care-plan" target="_blank" title="Businessweek">Businessweek</a>, the surveys that have been done up to this point have come up with widely varying results…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A Deloitte study last year suggested <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390443437504577545770682810842.html" target="_blank" title="10 percent">10 percent</a> of employers would stop offering group health plans. A widely criticized McKinsey report from 2011 put the number <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/21/business/21insure.html" target="_blank" title="as high as one-third">as high as one-third</a>. The Congressional Budget Office’s latest projections suggest <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/publication/43900" target="_blank" title="8 million">8 million</a>  fewer people will be covered by employer plans five years from now  under the ACA than without it. Many of them will get policies through  health insurance exchanges instead.</p>

But what everyone does agree on is that employer-based health coverage will continue to diminish.<br />
And we are already watching this happen right in front of our eyes.  Just this week, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304795804579097422592424860.html" target="_blank" title="the Wall Street Journal">the Wall Street Journal</a> reported that the largest security guard firm in the United States is dropping health coverage for 55,000 employees…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The nation’s largest provider of security guards plans to  discontinue its lowest-cost health plans and steer roughly 55,000  workers to new government-sponsored insurance exchanges for coverage  next year, in the latest sign of the fraying ties between employment and  health care. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The U.S. arm of Sweden’s Securitas AB is among more than 1,200  employers that offer the kind of bare-bones health plans that must be  phased out beginning Jan. 1 under the health-care law. Nearly four  million people are enrolled in these so-called mini-med plans, which cap  benefits to participants, sometimes at as little as $3,000 a year. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“The mini-meds go away and we’re not replacing them,” said Jim  McNulty, a spokesman for Securitas’s U.S. operation. “Their option is to  go to the exchanges.” </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Other big employers, including Darden Restaurants Inc., Home Depot  Inc. and Trader Joe’s Co., say they will stop offering health insurance  to part-time workers, and will direct those employees to the state  exchanges. Darden, Home Depot and Trader Joe’s previously offered  mini-meds to their part timers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trader Joe’s, the grocer once lauded for providing health  care coverage to its part-time workers, is about to push those  employees off its plan. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/11/trader-joes-obamacare_n_3902341.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="a memo obtained by the Huffington Post">a memo obtained by the <i>Huffington Post</i></a>, the company will stop covering employees who work less than 30 hours per week. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The change is set for the start of 2014. Instead of insurance, workers instead will get a check for $500 in January.<br />

</i>“Depending on income you may earn outside of Trader Joe’s, we  believe that with the $500 from Trader Joe’s and the tax credits  available under the [Affordable Care Act (ACA)], many of you should be  able to obtain health care coverage at very little if any net cost to  you,” said Trader Joe CEO Dan Bane in the memo.</p>

<p>And this is a huge reason why the shift from full-time work to  part-time work in America has accelerated this year.  Obamacare creates  an incentive for companies to have more part-time workers and less  full-time workers.  In fact, almost all of the jobs that have been  “created” by the U.S. economy in 2013 <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/the-number-of-private-sector-jobs-fell-by-278000-last-month-but-the-economy-is-getting-better" title="have been part-time jobs">have been part-time jobs</a>.</p>
<p>But it is incredibly difficult to try to support a family on a part-time job.  Sadly, <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/15-signs-that-the-quality-of-jobs-in-america-is-going-downhill-really-fast" title="the quality of our jobs">the quality of our jobs</a> continues to decline rapidly and only <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/07/05/only-47-americans-have-full-time-job" target="_blank" title="47 percent">47 percent</a> of all adults have a full-time job in America today.  This is only going to continue to get even worse under Obamacare.</p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>As a result of these trends, more Americans are going to be forced to  go out and buy health insurance “on the individual market”.  When they  do, they are likely to be in for a really <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/09/24/one-man-obamacare-nightmare/" target="_blank" title="nasty surprise">nasty surprise</a>…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Andy and Amy Mangione of Louisville, Ky. and their two  boys are just the kind of people who should be helped by ObamaCare. But  they recently got a nasty surprise in the mail. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“When I saw the letter when I came home from work,” Andy said,  describing the large red wording on the envelope from his insurance  carrier, “(it said) ‘your action required, benefit changes, act now.’ Of  course I opened it immediately.” </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It had stunning news. Insurance for the Mangiones and their two  boys,which they bought on the individual market, was going to almost  triple in 2014 — from $333 a month to $965. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The insurance carrier made it clear the increase was in order to be compliant with the new health care law.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Are you ready to have your health insurance premiums potentially double or triple?</p>
<p>In other cases, families are discovering that health insurance companies are simply <a href="http://onenewsnow.com//perspectives/michelle-malkin/2013/09/25/obama-lied-my-health-plan-died" target="_blank" title="cancelling their health insurance plans">cancelling their health insurance plans</a>…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Across the country, insurers are sending out  ObamaCare-induced health plan death notices to untold tens of thousands  of other customers in the individual market. Twitter users are posting  their ObamaCare cancellation notices and accompanying rate increases:</p>
<p>Linda Deright posted her letter from Regency of Washington state: “63  percent jump, old policy of 15 yrs. cancelled.” Karen J. Dugan wrote:  “Received same notice from Blue Shield CA for our small business.  Driving into exchange and no info since online site is down.” Chris Birk  wrote: “Got notice from BCBS that my current health plan is not ACA  compliant. New plan 2x as costly for worse coverage.” Small-business  owner Villi Wilson posted his letter from HMSA Blue Cross Blue Shield  canceling his individual plan and added: “I thought Obama said if I like  my health care plan I can keep my health care plan.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In fact, this even happened to one member of Congress.  <a href="http://onenewsnow.com//perspectives/michelle-malkin/2013/09/25/obama-lied-my-health-plan-died" target="_blank" title="U.S. Representative Cory Gardner">U.S. Representative Cory Gardner</a>  had purchased health insurance on his own because he wanted to  experience what his constituents were going through, and he recently got  a letter informing him that his old plan had been “discontinued”…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“After my current plan is discontinued,” he wrote last  week, “the closest comparable plan through our current provider will  cost over 100 percent more, going from roughly $650 a month to $1,480  per month.” He now carries his ObamaCare cancellation notice with him as  hardcore proof of the Democrats’ ultimate deception.</p>

<p>In the end, millions upon millions of us are going to get pushed on to the Obamacare health insurance exchanges.</p>
<p>We were promised that there would be lots of competition and that prices would be reasonable. Unfortunately, in some areas of the country it turns out that the  “exchanges” are turning out to be “monopolies” where consumers <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2013/09/26/congresswoman-obamacare-creating-health-insurance-monopolies/" target="_blank" title="will only have one company to choose from">will only have one company to choose from</a>…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Although seven insurance companies currently operate in  North Carolina, under the new Obamacare exchanges, those options will  dwindle down to one in the majority of counties,” Ellmers said Thursday  following the disclosure of figures by federal health officials showing  that more than 60 percent of North Carolina counties will have only one  insurance provider option under Obamacare: Blue Cross Blue Shield. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“The whole point of an online marketplace was to provide options, so  North Carolinians could go online, compare prices, and choose plans from  different companies. That is how competition is supposed to work!,”  Ellmers said. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Beginning October 1 under Obamacare, Blue Cross Blue Shield will be  the only health insurance provider serving the entire state of North  Carolina in the new Obamacare exchanges, serving all 100 of the state’s  counties. Its competitor Coventry Health Care, which is owned by Aetna,  will only reach 39 counties. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That leaves 61 counties, or 61 percent of all the state’s counties, in a Blue Cross Blue Shield-only zone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not only that, but a lot of these exchanges are not even going to be  ready to function properly on October 1st.  For example, according to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/09/25/d-c-s-obamacare-fail-prices-wont-work-until-november/" target="_blank" title="the Washington Post">the Washington Post</a>, the D.C. “health marketplace” is a complete and total mess at this point…</p>

<p>Just days away from launch, the District of Columbia’s health marketplace is announcing a pretty significant delay. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>While the D.C. Health Link will launch a Web site on October 1,  shoppers will not have access to the their premium prices until  mid-November. The delay comes after the District marketplace discovered  “a high error rate” in calculating the tax credits that low- and  middle-income people will use to purchase insurance on the marketplace. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The insurance marketplaces, if working as plan, are supposed to spit  out an estimate for a tax credit after a shopper enters in some basic  information about where she lives and how much she earns. In the  District, that won’t happen next month. Instead, the eligibility  determination will be made “off-line by experts” by early November.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So who is going to benefit from this new system?</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/expatguide.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/_qLAIskTQXUc/TZ9QqThBpRI/AAAAAAAAIG0/1ea27Wk9TKA/USam200.jpg"></a>Well, it turns out that the health insurance companies will greatly  benefit.  Health insurance companies helped write Obamacare, and their  stock prices have <strong>absolutely soared</strong> since Obamacare was signed into law.  If you doubt this, just check out the amazing charts in <a href="http://www.infowars.com/insurance-giants-that-wrote-and-lobbied-for-health-law-cash-in/" target="_blank" title="this article">this article</a>.</p>
<p>Not that they were hurting under the old system either.  They have  been raking in gigantic mountains of cash for years while trying to  provide as little health care as possible.  For much more on this,  please see my previous article entitled “<a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/50-signs-that-the-u-s-health-care-system-is-a-gigantic-money-making-scam-that-is-about-to-collapse" title="50 Signs That The U.S. Health Care System Is A Gigantic Money Making Scam">50 Signs That The U.S. Health Care System Is A Gigantic Money Making Scam</a>“.</p>
<p>For the rest of us, Obamacare is going to be even worse than the old system.  A <a href="https://www.instant.ly/report/52386bb2e4b0c02bc208a937" target="_blank" title="2013 Health Care Survey">2013 Health Care Survey</a> that polled 200 top health care professionals <a href="http://m.washingtonexaminer.com/19-of-health-care-pros-say-americans-will-die-earlier-due-to-obamacare/article/2536481" target="_blank" title="discovered the following">discovered the following</a> about what they believe Obamacare will bring…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>— 53 percent, “Quality of health insurance policies will suffer.”<br />
— 51 percent, “Quality of care will go down.”<br />
— 49 percent, “The law is overly complicated.”<br />
— 42 percent, “Insurance exchanges will be poorly managed.”<br />
— 37 percent, “The law still allows insurance companies to be the middleman.”<br />
— 32 percent, “Too complex for businesses.”<br />
— 19 percent, “Americans will die earlier.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So Americans are going to pay more, get worse care, have more  paperwork and a more complicated system, and they are likely to die  younger too?</p>
<p>Wow, that sounds like a great deal.</p>

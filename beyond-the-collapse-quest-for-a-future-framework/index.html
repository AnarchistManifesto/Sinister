<p>It is Sir Arthur Conan Doyle who sets the tone for this week’s  report: “Once you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter  how improbable, must be the truth.” He’s also credited with saying  “There is nothing as deceptive as an obvious fact.” </p>
<p>And so we begin our investigation, as an attempt to help us decide what to “bet on” in the future.</p>
<p>As long-term readers of George’s <a href="http://www.urbansurvival.com/" target="_blank" title="Urban Survival">UrbanSurvival.com</a>  site are aware, he bought a gold coin in September of 2001 and has been  amazed at how it has increased in value. This past week, however, he  admitted to his premium subscribers to <a href="http://www.peoplenomics.com/" target="_blank">www.peoplenomics.com</a>,  that while gold did not suffer a major decline during the mini-crash of  1987, and while it held relatively steady going into the  2008-2010 market declines, it has not done as well as many averages (and  hot stocks like Apple) ever since.</p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>So what are the right questions to ask?</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>A number of Gaye’s readers on <a href="http://www.backdoorsurvival.com/">Backdoor Survival site</a> have raised  concerns about our future, too, so it is not like we are alone in this  quest. This is especially true of the over-50 crowd. Not that things are  bad right now (well, maybe they are), but most assuredly things are  primed to get worse over the next decade.  The question at hand is  this:  What can we look forward to beyond the collapse?</p>
<p>With that is mind, Gaye decided to “turn the tables” on George this week and put some questions to him for a change.</p>
<div style="color: black">
<div align="center">
</div>
<p>
<b>Gaye:</b>  What are your  thoughts on Social Security? Will Social Security survive attempts to  reduce, eliminate or privatize? How big will the gap be between our  personal social security payments and our expenses?</p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>George:</b>  As long as the federal  government can continue with the make-believe story about the economy,  and as long as too many people don’t “get it” (like the misconception  that TARP made money <a href="http://www.sigtarp.gov/reports/congress/2012/April_25_2012_Report_to_Congress.pdf">when the truth revealed this week that it cost taxpayers at least $200 billion</a>), Social Security could continue making payments to perhaps 2037. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
That may sound like a long ways off, but it’s already 2012, so that  is just 25 years. If you’re 63 (like someone I see in the mirror every  day) this means I had better plan on funding my last years on earth some  other way than Social Security. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
50 years of news watching (and 20+ reporting) had taught me that  politicians do things slowly, over time, so people won’t notice. That’s a  pretty safe bet to make on Social Security. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
The reason comes down to basic demographics. Social Security was  always set up as a “pay-as-you-go” system. The theory (now known to be  demonstrably false) was that the cost of people leaving the workforce  could be paid by people entering the workforce. Bad call. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
A terrible conspiracy of factors – unaddressed by Congress despite  all the blue ribbon soft-shoe panels – is that we have structural  deficiencies which ought to kill Social Security within 10 years. Among  the big ones which don’t get addressed:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
America is no longer a manufacturing country. Since the  days of Social Security’s invention, we have gone from a country which  makes virtually everything we need to a country which is only beyond  self-sufficiency in food – and even that wouldn’t be possible without  huge energy imports from Mexico and Venezuela. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
Which gets me to the second factor: Since we don’t make what we used  to, and because we have allowed wholesale jobjacking to least-cost labor  centers (third world crap-holes I call them) we have had to borrow huge  amounts of money just to remain in operation as a country.  Anyone can find the total US DEBT <a href="http://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/BPDLogin?application=np" target="_blank">on the US Treasury Public Debt to the Penny page here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
What most people don’t take into account, when they look  at the public debt numbers (about $15.63 trillion) is that the  intergovernmental debt holdings include money for the Social Security  Trust Fund. In other words, money which came into the federal  government for a designated trust was hijacked by a disreputable Congress (emphasis on the “con” part) and spent on entitlements and  social programs which the country could not afford on a cash basis.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
So, in reality, the Trust Fund was raided to come up with  current expense money. What happens, when that money is needed, is that  the intergovernmental loans will have to be paid back, and since there  is not enough money around to do that, the government will have to “make  up” money (by printing it). The result is sure to be (once we get  through the deflationary phase of the Second Depression we’re now in,  and experiencing slow-motion since the market peak in 2000), inflation  which could be on the order of 25 to 75%.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
Of course, such a scheme will do several things: First, it will send  the price of real goods screaming skyward. Second, anything that’s a  tangible commodity with value will go through the roof – things like  farmland, gold, silver, and energy. Third, as government already  understates the true costs of inflation, Social Security recipients have  the deck stacked against them. Yes, the nominal (count them) piece of  paper may go up, but they will never be allowed to go up faster than the  actual rate of paper printing. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
There are other issues, too, of course. Like the Higher Education  Hoax, which colleges and universities have been unwitting conspirators  in. Not only is America lacking jobs for people coming out of college, but they are forcing millions of young people to remain in  school – often training for jobs that never materialize. And then – this  is the clever Three Card Monte of it – the student loans become part of  intergovernmental lending, which then get bundled and sold off to  investors. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
A conspiracy-minded individual – just looking at the data – could see  in a heartbeat that one way for the US to get out of (or dramatically  reduce Social Security) would be to kill off a lot of Americans over,  say, the age of 65. And, as “evidence” of how this is playing out  elsewhere, we note that Japan is likely to lose its grip on #1 in  longevity as the inevitable increases in cancers and such result from  Fukushima. </p>

This is not to say such a conspiracy really “exists” but it does make  the point that the DATA supports such a view. Don’t like it? Don’t  meltdown Japan. </p>

<p>
A second reason for future healthcare to deteriorate – besides the  economic incentive to kill old people because they take up job slots and  they eat food – is that they also vote conservatively. While that used  to be a bonus point for the Republican party, it is becoming less so as  more and more people hit the 70s and up and see both parties as crooked  and become latter day “Independents.”</p>

<b>Gaye:</b>  So what’s the government to do?</div>
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>George:</b>  First, since government has  essentially been purchased by Washington law firms which shovel  corporate money into government persuasion programs day and night, the  Food and Drug administration has been death on affordable health care.<br />
As one example, a drug called colchicine, used to treat gout, which  had previously been costing consumers 9¢ a pill was ruled “proprietary”  under highly suspicious circumstances and now costs people like me, who  aren’t broke and don’t have medical coverage for small prescriptions,  $5.28 per pill. Even the medical community was outraged, but when the  FDA doesn’t have any rules preventing its members from taking fat jobs  in the Big Pharma world upon leaving government, what would you expect? </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
Similarly, studies on the value of statin drugs, which have in many  cases terrible side-effects, have been plastered over with statistical  studies that are often incomprehensible event to experts in statistics.  If you want to read the “other side” of the cholesterol case, Dr. Ufffe  Ravnskov’s “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1453759409/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=gayegeorge-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1453759409" target="_blank" title="Ignore the Awkward.: How the Cholesterol Myths Are Kept Alive">Ignore the Awkward.: How the Cholesterol Myths Are Kept Alive</a>”  does a fine job of tearing the bad data apart, but such shining example  of good medical scholarship are simply overwhelmed by what? Big Pharma  industry advertising. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
Whose doctor is going to risk a patient who is told “Be sure and ask your doctor…”?<br />
Last, but not least, we have the government seizing everything in  sight that has good results, even if it’s from the natural foods sector –  which at least in theory, the FDA shouldn’t be messing with. I’m sure  you recall the “guns drawn” bust of the whole milk sellers. But where’s  the FDA when it comes to keeping unnatural strands of DNA from junk crop  breeding programs? </p>

<b>Gaye:</b>  The return on  our investments has been scrappy for those seeking preservation of  capital.  Banksters have been bailed out via zero interest on savings,  forcing retirees into more risky investments or to eat up principal in  order to survive.

Now when it comes to money, if I put a duplexing (double-sided  printing) laser printer, a couple of reams of high-quality paper, maybe  some stick-on gold seals, and some official serial numbers to put on  them, would you consider that wealth? Not really. </p>

Which…and this is really why I still haven’t sold the ranch in East  Texas and we live out here in spider and snake land…is why we will  ultimately have to fall back on our ability to produce things. For me,  my big agenda in the coming year is really simple: Get good at growing  our own food. Since, if paper depreciates (which is what inflation  really is…printing up more money than the goods and services justify…so  that it takes more paper to buy the same things) that leaves food and  water from the land as one of the last hedges. </p>

<p>
<b>George:</b>  Yes, but likely we will get a  second decline in the economy – back to 2008-2009 levels first. The  reason is simple: People will need to be sold “the same old answers” the  “new way” which will be a replay of the 1930s. </p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
The answer: dead pools of capital. Money is going back to its owners.  Back to the rich. Which is why we see the tremendous concentration of  wealth we have today.

<p>
My expectation is this time around, since the dynamics are different,  the broken promises which will bring people out to the streets will be  different: Social Security failing to deliver to expectations and the  threat of class action fraud suits against government – which could be  won, I believe in front of a jury. </p>

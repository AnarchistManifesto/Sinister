By Nick Giambruno</p>
<p>62 years later, the aftermath is still troubling global politics.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/All-Shahs-Men-American-Middle/dp/047018549X?tag=permacultucom-20&amp;linkCode=w13&amp;linkID=&amp;ref_=assoc_res_sw_cr_dka_cra_t0_result_2&amp;ref-refURL=http%3A%2F%2Factivistpost.net%2Fbanners%2Famazon.htm">Operation Ajax</a> was a pivotal moment in US and world history. It was the first time the CIA overthrew a government.</p>
<p>Yet even today the US government would rather not talk about it. That’s why it remains an unknown story for many Americans.</p>
<p>The year was 1953. The objective was to oust Mohammad Mossadegh, the elected leader of the Majlis, Iran’s parliament.</p>
<p>Mossadegh was not a communist or a radical Islamist. He didn’t follow  any objectionable ideology. Instead, he was a secular nationalist. But  he was inconvenient.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>Like many Iranians, he was proud of his Persian heritage. (Until  1935, Iran was still known as Persia.) Persia once was an imperial  civilization, like Rome. Twentieth-century nationalists channeled that  glorious past, and they were keen on independence.</p>
<p>So it’s no surprise Mossadegh was earnest about ridding the country’s politics of foreign influence.<br />
At the time, Great Britain was the most active outside power in Iran.</p>
<p>For decades the British had enjoyed a sweetheart oil deal struck with  a former, corrupt Iranian leader. It allowed them to control Iran’s  petroleum industry and, by extension, the country’s entire economy.</p>
<div align="left">

<p>To nationalists like Mossadegh, this was intolerable and infuriating.  It would be like China getting a sweetheart deal from President Obama  for control of the US auto industry. No red-blooded American would stand  for such a thing.</p>
<p>It was the early 1950s. The smoke from World War II, a war that killed over <i>60 million people</i>,  still lingered. The horrors were fresh in everyone’s mind. Access to  oil had been a decisive factor in that war. Had Hitler succeeded in  securing his supply in 1942, the world might look very different today.</p>
<p>It was a concept not lost on the British. If any country wanted to  win a big war, it needed oil. Lots of it. It was a matter of life and  death.</p>
<p>Iran was a major source of oil for the British. Access to it was a  strategic military asset of the highest order. One the British would not  give up for any price.</p>
<p>Mossadegh understood this. He concluded that the only way to claw  back the oil industry was to nationalize it. On May 1, 1951, he did just  that. Shortly afterward, he stated:</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>Another important consideration is that by  the elimination of the power of the British company, we would also  eliminate corruption and intrigue, by means of which the internal  affairs of our country have been influenced. Once this tutelage has  ceased, Iran will have achieved its economic and political independence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/empsurvival.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img src="http://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-SH9_X5Yf-SY/UCq-RF-L_6I/AAAAAAAARZw/84wbu_McHzE/s200/200x200.jpg"></a>The British were not about to give up. They hatched a plot to regain  their influence in Iran. But they couldn’t do it alone. They would need  help from the US. But the US just wasn’t interested. So the British  undertook a campaign to paint Mossadegh as a communist.</p>
<p>The Brits played America’s Cold-War fears like a piano. They  convinced the US government that the commies were making inroads in  Iran. Given that Iran was just south of the expanding Soviet Union, the  story was plausible… but not true.</p>
<p>In the end, it worked. The Americans came on board. Operation Ajax  was born. The objective: overthrow Mossadegh’s elected government and  replace it with something more pliable.</p>
<p>MI6, the UK’s foreign spy agency, and the CIA would organize the  coup. Kermit Roosevelt, a grandson of former US President Teddy  Roosevelt, was the CIA officer in charge.</p>
<p>The goal was to return the monarchy of Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi  (also known as “the Shah”) to power. (In Farsi, the Persian language,  “shah” means “king.”)</p>
<p>The CIA and MI6 used classic methods of subterfuge. They paid Iranian  goons to pose as communists and wreak havoc in Tehran, the Iranian  capital, and vandalize its business district. The police couldn’t  restrain them, and the violence grew.</p>
<p>The coup plotters knew such events would disgust ordinary Iranians,  who were fearful of communism. It would cause them to demand action.  That action would include the Iranian military stepping in. As part of  the plot, the CIA and MI6 had corrupted key Iranian generals for just  this moment.</p>
<p>As if on cue, the generals took charge and deposed Mossadegh’s  government. The Iranian people didn’t resist. Instead, they cheered.  They thought the military was saving them from a violent communist  revolution.</p>
<p>Mossadegh’s government was out of the way. The coup’s operatives in  the Iranian military had seized power. The path had been cleared for the  Shah.</p>
<p>The Shah knew he owed his position to the US and UK. What they  giveth, they could taketh away. The Shah was more than willing to do  whatever the US and UK wanted him to do. Operation Ajax was a success…  but it would not be an enduring one.</p>
<p>The Iranian people would eventually figure out what really happened.  Many of them would come to despise the Shah as a puppet of a foreign  power. To maintain his position, the Shah became more despotic… which  only fed the opposition.</p>
<p>In 1979, 26 years after Operation Ajax, a popular uprising overthrew  the Shah. A power struggle ensued, and Ayatollah Khomeini’s Islamist  forces prevailed. The Islamic Republic of Iran was born. This time, it  was an anti-American government that came to power. Decades of animosity  followed, and it continues to this day.</p>
<p>It’s unthinkable to most that the Islamic Republic of Iran could  offer any sort of investment opportunity. Many find the mere mention of  the country distasteful.</p>
<p>There’s another country that most would have considered unthinkable  to invest in at one time. Many got hot under the collar just at the  mention of its name too: the People’s Republic of China.</p>
<p>If you had followed their thinking, you would have missed out on one  of recent history’s most powerful economic booms. That’s precisely why  you should ditch the conventional wisdom when it comes to thinking about  profiting from Iran. If you don’t, you could be letting a  once-in-a-generation opportunity pass you by.</p>
<p>Recently, I discussed investing in Iran with legendary investor Jim Rogers<b>.</b> He told us:</p>
<div style="margin-left: .5in">
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>I bought Iranian shares in 1993, and over  the next few years, [they] went up something like 47 times, so it was an  astonishing success.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>That was then. Now, additional sanctions make investing directly in  Iran off limits to Americans and most Europeans. But that could soon  change.</p>
<p>The conclusion of the negotiations on Iran’s nuclear program means  the economic floodgates will open. Persia will once again be open for  business. It would be a big deal: Iran’s $370 billion economy is by far  the largest still excluded from the international financial system.</p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

A tremendous amount of wealth is waiting to be  developed.</p>
<p>Iran’s economy is not all about natural resources. The country is  home to advanced nanotechnologies and the Middle East’s largest car  manufacturer. Its young population of 78 million yearns for iPhones and  other Western products, and there’s enormous built-up demand. That  demand is getting ready to explode like Mt. St. Helens.</p>
<p>European and Asian companies have been scrambling to Tehran to line up business deals.</p>
<p>In short, the opening of Iran is a <b><i>massive</i></b> opportunity.</p>
<p>Even if the West doesn’t lift the sanctions, Iran will simply turn to  the East to do business. Either way, the Iranian economy is on course  to experience one of the greatest booms in recent history. It’s on a  scale the world hasn’t seen since the opening of China. Opportunities  like this don’t happen every day, every year, or even every decade.</p>
<p>But for the average American, Iran is at the bottom of the list of  potential investment destinations. That’s what more than 30 years of  hostility and charter membership in the “Axis of Evil” will do.</p>
<p>The sentiment couldn’t get any worse. As a contrarian, that’s just  how I like it. But only if there is a solid reason to believe that the  negative sentiment is misplaced. In the case of Iran, I am certain that  it is.</p>

</div>
<p>In the not-so-distant past, I used to live in the United Arab  Emirates… right across the Persian Gulf from Iran. Being there gave me  the chance to see the country firsthand.</p>
<p><b>On the Ground in Iran</b></p>
<p>Hands down, Iran is the most fascinating country I’ve ever been to.</p>
<p>I’ve been to almost every country in the Middle East. Iran stands out  for a number of reasons. Unlike most other states in the Middle East,  Persia is not an artificial construct. By race, religion, and social  history, it is a nation. And European bureaucrats didn’t dream up Iran  by drawing zig-zags on a map. The map reflects the geographic reality of  a country with natural, fortress-like, mountain borders.<br />
For an American, getting there isn’t easy. But that’s part of the allure.</p>
<p>You can’t simply hop on a flight to Tehran from New York, like you  would to Vancouver or London. You can’t enter the country unless the  Iranian government has granted you permission in advance. And they take  their careful time.</p>
<p>The US has no diplomatic relations with Iran. There is no Iranian  embassy or consulate in the US at which to apply for a visa, but there  is an Iranian interests section in the Pakistani embassy in Washington,  DC, that can handle such requests. I was living near Dubai at the time,  so it was easier for me to go to the Iranian consulate there.</p>
<p>But you can’t just drop in to the Iranian consulate and apply for a  tourist visa. You have to work with an authorized service to assist you  in the process, which is what I did. After I submitted my paperwork and  waited a number of weeks, and then waited another couple of weeks, the  Iranian government approved my application.</p>
<p>I immediately noticed that the Iranian visa in my passport was not  the kind of cheap stamp you often get from Third-World countries.  Instead it carried holograms and other anti-counterfeiting features. Things that are associated with documents from developed countries. It  was a clue that Iran, a seemingly isolated and underdeveloped place, was  more sophisticated than I had expected.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/goingglobal.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 0em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_qLAIskTQXUc/TZ9T4EJnMJI/AAAAAAAAIG8/CxyihDChBW0/unclesam200.gif"></a>Sanctions have disconnected Iran from the international financial  system. Your ATM and credit cards won’t work there. You need to bring  cash (US dollars or euros work best) and exchange it for Iranian rials.  Iranians also have increasingly returned to gold as a store of value and  medium of exchange. This is no surprise. People in all corners of the  globe have used gold this way for thousands of years.</p>
<p>As soon as my flight landed in Tehran, my Iranian “tour guide”  greeted me. The Iranian government requires that minders accompany  Americans at all times. It’s a result of the Iranian government’s  not-necessarily unreasonable paranoia. They’d like to prevent Operation  Ajax 2.0.</p>
<p>Having a mandatory tour guide wasn’t all bad. Mine was a dual  American-Iranian citizen named Ali. Ali had spent a lot of time in  California and spoke perfect American English. He took me everywhere I  wanted to go. At the end of some days, Ali would let me go off on my  own. This gave me the chance to explore Tehran’s affluent northern  suburbs and legendary bazaar.</p>
<p>No matter where I went, everyone was genuinely kind and hospitable…  even after figuring out I was American. Not what you would expect for a  place known for its “Death to America” chants. It became obvious the  average Iranian harbors no hatred for Americans. (For more on what life  is really like in Iran, I’d suggest you watch travel writer Rick Steves’  video, <a href="http://www.internationalman.com/go/urbuw-2/ATP" target="_blank"><i>Rick Steves’ Iran</i></a>.)</p>
<p>The trip to Iran helped solidify my belief that the country is the  ultimate contrarian opportunity. It revealed the reality hiding behind  the frenzied sentiment of conventional thinking. It was just waiting for  the right catalyst. And now that catalyst is at hand. The conclusion of  the nuclear negotiations and the relaxation of sanctions will release  all the massive, built-up economic potential.</p>
<p>The rationale for profiting from the opening of Iran is clear.  Finding a practical way to do so is not. There is a way, however… and a  good one. One that is easily accessible through any brokerage account to  US investors and is completely legal for them. <a href="http://www.internationalman.com/go/urbxx-2/ATP" target="_blank"><b>For all the details click here to check out the latest issue of <i>Crisis Speculator.</i></b></a></p>

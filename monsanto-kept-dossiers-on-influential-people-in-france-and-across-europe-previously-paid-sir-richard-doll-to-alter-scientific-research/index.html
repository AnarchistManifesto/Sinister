<p>Bayer (Monsanto), the formerly merged company of potentially two of the evilest businesses in history is now under fire for keeping a dossier on influential people such as journalists in France, and according to Monsanto, they did the same across Europe, <em>Reuters </em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bayer-france-monsanto-europe/bayer-says-monsanto-likely-kept-files-on-influential-people-across-europe-idUSKCN1SJ1OY">reported.</a></p>
<p>French prosecutors allege that Monsanto kept a file of 200 names, including journalists and lawmakers in hopes of influencing positions on pesticides. The investigation was opened after newspaper <em>Le Monde</em> filed a complaint alleging the bribery. Monsanto admitted in a press conference with journalists that other countries in Europe were also affected by its lists.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>âItâs safe to say that other countries in Europe were affected by lists â¦ I assume that all EU member states could potentially be affected,â Matthias Berninger, Bayerâs head of public affairs and sustainability, told journalists on Monday.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>French public-sector research institutes Inra and CNRS also said they would file criminal complaints over mishandling of their employees personal data, after finding that some of their researchers and executives were included in Monsantoâs influencer list.</p>
<p>Bayer stated that to its knowledge Monsanto had not broken any laws lobbying scientific decisions on its products.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It added, âBayer will ask an external law firm to investigate the project Monsanto commissioned and evaluate the allegations. The law firm will also inform all of the persons on the lists of the information collected about themâ.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Monsanto is documented to have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2006/dec/08/smoking.frontpagenews" rel="noopener noreferrer">paid off</a> Sir Richard Doll, a renowned cancer researcher, for 20 years. Doll received a consultancy fee of $1,500 a day in the mid-1980s for his research on Monsantoâs Agent Orange, finding the chemical didnât cause cancer.</p>
<p>As this author <a href="https://activatenow.us/bayer-shares-down-38-second-jury-rules-roundup-weed-killer-causes-cancer/">reported</a> for <em>Activate Now</em>, Bayer/Monsanto was recently faced with a jury concluding that its Roundup product causes cancer. The finding was according to a second U.S. jury who ruled its Roundup weed killer was a carcinogenic substance that caused plaintiff Edwin Hardemanâs disease.</p>
<p>While Monsanto always insistedÂ <a class="" title="" role="" href="https://monsanto.com/company/media/statements/glyphosate-report-response/" target="" rel="noopener noreferrer">âglyphosate has a long history of safe use,â</a>Â a study by the World Health Organizationâs International Agency for Research on Cancer classified glyphosate asÂ <a class="" title="" role="" href="https://theecologist.org/2015/mar/23/iarc-glyphosate-probably-carcinogenic" target="" rel="noopener noreferrer">âprobably carcinogenicâ</a>Â back in 2015.</p>
<p>One year later, another organization, PAN, the Pesticide Action Network International, issued a 96-pageÂ <a href="http://www.naturalblaze.com/2016/10/glyphosate-contaminates-global-ecosystem-damning-new-pan-report.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">report</a>Â stating that glyphosate contaminates the Global Ecosystem. That same year the FDA suspended testing for glyphosate residues in food. Those foods, according to a subsequentÂ <a href="https://usrtk.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/FDN_Glyphosate_FoodTesting_Report_p2016-3.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">report</a>Â by Food Democracy Now! and the Detox Project, included many of Americaâs most popular foods including â cookies, crackers, popular cold cereals, and chips. The chemical was also found inÂ <a href="http://www.naturalblaze.com/2016/03/glyphosate-found-to-contaminate-california-wine.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">several wines</a>Â including organic wines,Â <a href="http://www.naturalblaze.com/2016/10/fda-tests-confirm-oatmeal-baby-foods-contain-residues-of-monsanto-weed-killer.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">baby food and formula</a>,Â <a href="https://www.ecowatch.com/toxic-weed-killer-glyphosate-found-in-breast-milk-infant-formula-1882030657.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">breast milk</a>Â and evenÂ <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2015/10/26/tampons-carcinogens_n_8392912.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">tampons</a>.</p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>Glyphosate is also sprayed directly on many types of conventional crops before harvest, including wheat, oats, and barley. In all, glyphosate is used in some fashion in the production of at least 70 food crops, according to the EPA, including a range of fruits, nuts, and veggies.</p>
<p>Glyphosate was also listed as a carcinogen onÂ <a title="Prop 65 list" href="https://oehha.ca.gov/proposition-65/crnr/glyphosate-listed-effective-july-7-2017-known-state-california-cause-cancer" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">California EPAâs Prop 65 list in July of 2017,</a>Â while a studyÂ <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep39328?WT.feed_name=subjects_biotechnology" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">published</a>Â in January of 2017 proved that chronic consumption of low levels of Roundup (which contains glyphosate)Â <a href="https://www.naturalblaze.com/2017/01/roundup-now-proven-to-cause-liver-disease-and-its-in-your-food.html" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">caused</a>Â fatty liver disease in animals.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in another study scientistsÂ <a href="https://ehjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12940-015-0056-1" rel="noopener noreferrer">have found</a>Â that exposing rats to ultra-low doses of Roundup caused liver and kidney damage.</p>
<p>AnotherÂ <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-who-glyphosate-idUSKCN0Y71HR" rel="noopener noreferrer">study</a>Â done by the WHO and UN experts at the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) conflicted the IARC report and found that âglyphosate did not cause cancer and pose a risk to humans.â</p>
<p>AnÂ <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/mar/15/no-cancer-risk-to-using-glyphosate-weedkiller-says-eu-watchdog" rel="noopener noreferrer">additional report</a>Â earlier this year by the European Chemical Agency agreed with the FAO study stating that glyphosate was âsafe.â</p>
<p>Monsanto now (Bayer) has an obvious conflicting record on whether or not its glyphosate chemical is safe or not.</p>
<p>Another California man, Dewayne Lee Johnson, was <a href="https://time.com/5460793/dewayne-lee-johnson-monsanto-lawsuit/">awarded</a>Â $289 million in August last year after a state jury found Roundup caused his own cancer. That award was later reduced to $78 million and is on appeal by Bayer.</p>
<p>One may wonder why they chose to go with Bayer instead of Monsanto, as Bayer also has a nasty history. No one is forgetting anytime soon that BayerÂ <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bayer-sold-hiv-risky-meds/">sold tainted</a> hemophiliac medicine which caused users to contract AIDS, sorry PR reps.</p>
<p>Bill Maher runs down both evil companiesâ so-called âachievementsâ in the video below, which includes âgiving heroin to children as medicine, creating Zyklon B, PCBs, Aspartame, DDT, Agent Orange and of course Roundup!â</p>

<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, Bayerâs Roundup product isnât the only product that causes problems; another commodity called Dicamba has also faced a backlash.</p>
<p>Dicamba has been under fire by farmers for causingÂ <a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2017-07/documents/fifra-dicambacomplianceadvisory-201708.pdf" rel="noopener">widespread damage</a> to their crops that are not GMOs designed to resist the chemical. Dicamba was even banned in Arkansas by the Plant Board, which Monsanto <a href="https://www.naturalblaze.com/2017/10/monsanto-sues-arkansas-board-dicamba-ban.html" rel="noopener">disputed</a>Â and sued the group forÂ acting outside its authority in prohibiting its herbicideâs use and failing to consider research Monsanto had submitted to federal regulators.</p>
<p>Dicamba is considered more toxic than glyphosate, but less toxic than 2,4-D, the third most common broadleaf herbicide. (Monsanto is working on crops that are resistant to 2,4-D, as well.) Yet, when used properly, dicamba is considered only mildly toxic to people, pollinators, wildlife, and aquatic organisms. There is no scientific consensus on whether it has cancer-causing properties, though theÂ <a href="http://npic.orst.edu/factsheets/archive/dicamba_tech.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">EPA says</a>Â âDicamba is not likely to be a human carcinogen.â</p>
<p>Then there is Monsantoâs product itÂ <a href="https://www.naturalblaze.com/2017/11/monsanto-nemastrike-rashes.html">canceled launching,</a> called NemaStrike, which is designed to be applied to crop seeds to protect them from worms and other bugs. The launch was halted after reports indicated that it caused strange rashes on people who came into contact with the chemical.</p>
<p>With two cases against Bayer found to be guilty for causing cancer, and a pending 11,200 Roundup lawsuits by farmers, home gardeners and landscapers claiming its glyphosate-based herbicides cause non-Hodgkin lymphoma and other cancers, as well as <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/bayers-roundup-caused-mans-cancer-jury-finds-monsanto-liability-trial-up-next-2019-03-19">six more trials</a> due to start this year in federal and state courts to go to trial in the U.S., Bayer is going to have a busy time with litigation.</p>
<p>Especially since this piles on top of a flood of lawsuits over waterways contaminated with PCBs (chemical compounds used in transformers, paints, sealants), and fresh cases <a href="https://www.agweb.com/article/dicamba-trials-to-start-october-2019/">emerging</a>Â over Dicamba.</p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>The current trial on Roundup for Hardeman is still pending liability ruling; however, with the evidence cited in this article, it seems like Bayer is surely liable.</p>
<p>Itâs unfortunate that recently deceased former President George H.W. Bushâs legacy is leaving earth with the monstrosity that is now Bayer. Among many atrocities, the former director of the CIA is also known for deregulating the industry that is responsible for poisoning people with <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/monsanto-vietnam-agent-orange_us_57a9e002e4b0b770b1a445ba?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer_us=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaHVmZmluZ3RvbnBvc3QuY29tLw&amp;guce_referrer_cs=JBs96y8uCoPyOWvvTnIiYw">Agent Orange</a>, as well as also having been responsible for the research of the uranium used for the Manhattan Project <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dayton_Project">(Dayton Project)</a> and PCBs chemicals.</p>
</p>
<p>One has to wonder how much George H.W. Bush was paid, since he deregulated the government to allow Monsanto to produce their crops as the video above documents and drafted laws on how the U.S. would handle GMOs. One can also speculate how may people Monsanto actually paid to push their cancerous products on humanity. But itâs important to point out once again for the reader that the company was caught in the 1980s when it paid off Richard Doll who pushed that their chemical product in the form of Agent Orange didnât cause cancer.</p>

<p>Monsanto also had Blackwater set up as its âIntel armâ by Cofer Black, the former head of the CIAâs counter-terrorism center. In 2008 Black traveled to ZÃ¼rich to meet Kevin Wilson, a security manager for global issues at Monsanto. Black worked as the chairman for the Total Intelligence Consulting Company at the time, which was owned by Blackwater. During this meeting with Wilson, Black <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/blackwaters-black-ops/">proposed to make Total Intelligence the âintel armâ of Monsanto.</a></p>
<p>Monsanto then hired Total Intelligence Solutions from 2008-09 under the agreement, contracting the firm to âinfiltrate animal rights activist groups by having employees become legal members.â It also promised to monitor activistsâ blogs and websites on Monsantoâs behalf.</p>
<p>Besides George H.W. Bush deregulating the industry for Monsanto and Sir Richard Doll pushing that its Agent Orange chemical was safe, there is also the story of Michael R. Taylorâs who has a history of back-and-forth employment between the big agriculture industryâs public and private sector. Taylor first began his career working for a corporate law firm that represented Monsanto, before being hired as a policy chief for the FDA in the early â90s. Taylor was later hired directly by Monsanto as its vice president of public policy, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/obama-gives-former-food-lobbyist-michael-taylor-a-second-chance-at-the-fda/">before being tapped again to lead the FDA in 2009.</a></p>
<p>Taylorâs policies in the â90s allowed for the approval of GMOs and recombinant bovine growth hormone, or rBGH. However, as the FDA chief, he never required producers to label food products containing GMOs, thus creating the controversy we have today.</p>
<p>Taylor is far from the only former Monsanto employee who would later go on to work in government. In fact, former Monsanto employees have worked in every aspect of government at the State Department, Department of Defense, Supreme Court, EPA, Social Security Administration, and Department of Commerce, <a href="http://ahrp.org/a-profit-enhancing-policy-shift-trumps-public-safety-scientific-integrity/">according</a> to AHRP which has extensively documented the revolving door.</p>
<p>Citizens are growing increasingly aware that companies like Bayer/Monsanto are bad for their health and the environment. Itâs heartbreaking to see a chemical company involved with the poisoning of U.S. families still poisoning people decades later.</p>
<p>Whatâs more worrying is that Monsanto ordered Blackwater to harass private citizens, paid off researchers and has had a revolving door in the U.S. for policy. All of this truly shows the extent of the stain of corruption that Monsanto has manufactured.</p>
<p>In the report, <em>Reuters</em> mentioned that Monsantoâs stock is down â40 percent since the first adverse U.S. judgment on Roundup last August, leaving the company with a market capitalization smaller than the price it paid for Monsantoâ in its acquisitional merger of the company.</p>
<p>Bayer/Monsanto will continue to face multiple pronged attacks against its dangerous products, finally being exposed for their cancer-causing elements in their chemicals and other health hazards in not one, not two, but three different commodities and more likely to come. This latest news of keeping dossiers on influential people in France and other countries in Europe who Monsanto could then attempt to bribe, like they did to Richard Doll paying as consultants, is just another part of Monsantoâs filthy corrupt history that Bayer now bears with the merger.</p>

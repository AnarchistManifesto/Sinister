<p>For his myriad faults, it’s easy to see why Donald Trump’s anti-Globalist rhetoric has stricken a chord with the American electorate. His vocal opposition to Neomercantile trade deals, his rhetorical rejection of “Sustainable Development” on the world stage; The Donald is doubtlessly a captivating figure to the dispossessed, downtrodden American voter seeking something – <em>anything</em> – to halt the ravages wrought by World Order Machiavellians.</p>
<p>If nothing else, watching Trump’s bombast single-handedly stymie a potential continuation of the Bush Crime Family Dynasty (to the ire of Neocons everywhere) has made for fantastic entertainment. Watching as a similar fate befalls the Clinton Syndicate, whose war crimes, Nation-State destroying “charitable” frauds, drug and arms-running accolades and ever-increasing body count deserve open scrutiny, has also made for a good bit of fun.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most satisfying aspect of this public airing of Bush/Clinton dirty laundry is that, in many cases, <em>the two share more than a few articles of clothing</em>. Both, through the Clinton Foundation, are complicit in looting the nation of Haiti and “<a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/article/437883/hillarys-america-secret-history-democratic-party-dinesh-dsouza-clinton-foundation" target="_blank">disappearing” millions in charitable donations for earthquake relief</a> – a fraud that preceded <a href="http://www.sciencealert.com/the-un-has-admitted-it-played-a-role-in-the-cholera-outbreak-in-haiti" target="_blank">the United Nations’ introduction of a deadly outbreak of cholera on the island</a>. Both, too, gained a significant amount of (deep) political prestige and economic clout from the CIA drug trade – as Vice President during the cocaine-fueled 1980s, Bush the Elder is as complicit in the Iran-Contra drug trade as anyone alive. And as then-Governor of Arkansas, home of the Agency’s infamous Mena, AK “drug drop” operation, Bill Clinton may as well have been a Regional Director of Cocaine, Inc.</p>
<p>Tracing this interlocking web of serial political criminals is one of the best methods we have of demonstrating the pervasive racket of oligarchy that rules America (and the world) today. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Lombardi" target="_blank">stunning and informative artwork of the late Mark Lombardi</a>, outlining the connections of banking, political, and drug trade interests, is a stark reminder of how truly intertwined the network of the Deep State truly is:</p>
</p>
<p>All this, however, begs questions: Can <em>any</em> political figure be as successful in the Two-Party Racket as The Donald has been <em>without</em> being connected to this web of Deep State actors? As a product of the “go-go, Greed is Good” ’80s, is Trump’s fortune connected to the drug and arms dealers of the Iran-Contra/BCCI/S&amp;L scandals also synonymous with the era? And if so, have such connections continued through to the present?</p>

<h3>The Donald and the Deep State Drug Traders</h3>
<p>It is no exaggeration to say that the Bush and Clinton empires have been built, in large part, on the backs of the drug trade. This knowledge within the broader conspiracy culture has been widely circulated since at least the release of the 1995 underground hit, <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epXVDEn3gsQ" target="_blank">The Mena Connection</a></em>:</p>
<p>[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epXVDEn3gsQ]</p>
<p>Given the sheer nature and scope of the Deep State drug and arms trade, perhaps it is not surprising to find that Mr. Trump has his fair share of connections to its players – and not insignificant ones, at that. A great deal of work in unearthing these relationships has been done by <a href="http://www.madcowprod.com/" target="_blank">investigative journalist Daniel Hopsicker</a>, best known for his documentaries and books on the CIA drug trade as well as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6W4L-HK-Os" target="_blank">the 9/11 Venice, Florida coverup</a>. A seasoned sleuth in his own right, Hopsicker has recently documented a longstanding relationship between Donald Trump and a number of Deep State actors, like CIA asset <a href="http://www.madcowprod.com/2016/03/17/donald-trump-dirty-money-the-filthy-rich-in-palm-beach/" target="_blank">Meyer Lansky’s partner, Louis Lesser</a>, who Trump purchased the <a href="http://www.gutenberg.us/articles/louis_lesser_enterprises,_inc." target="_blank">Taj Mahal Casino and Hotel from in Atlantic City</a>.</p>
<p>Another of these characters is known CIA asset and Saudi arms dealer, Adnan Khashoggi, a man whose connections to the Iran-Contra affair and the Deep State at large <a href="http://peacerevolution.podomatic.com/entry/2016-05-26T11_48_08-07_00" target="_blank">are far beyond the scope of this article</a>.</p>
<p>In his post entitled, “<a href="http://www.madcowprod.com/2016/03/09/donald-trump-palm-beach-homies/" target="_blank">Donald Trump and the Palm Beach Homies,</a>” it is alleged that Trump purchased Adnan Khashoggi’s yacht, at the time the longest in the world, in the mid-’90s from the cash-strapped, scandal-ridden Saudi “Man of Mystery.” Khashoggi is also said to have attended The Donald’s most recent wedding, neither of which are damning connections in and of themselves; they do, however, demonstrate a friendly relationship.</p>
<p>The most concrete evidence escalating their relationship from casual acquaintances to potential <em>partners in crime, </em>however, comes from a local Palm Beach source. Hopsicker says <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8TwaOBpVJo" target="_blank">in a recent interview</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I have information from a source over in Palm Beach that when Adnan Khashoggi was under indictment for ripping off the second largest bank in Thailand, and INTERPOL was searching for him, he was hiding out in a bungalow at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago" target="_blank">Mar-a-Lago.</a>” (One of Donald Trump’s real estate developments in Palm Beach.)</p>
<p>-Daniel Hopsicker</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Being friends with a spook is one thing – helping said spook to avoid detection in the wake of yet another “Too Big to Jail” bankster looting of the developing world is something else entirely.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/spybook.html" rel="nofollow"><img class="alignleft" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Oq5Im_ize04/VmRks0yjT4I/AAAAAAAACGk/lZjOmUnvnGk/s250-Ic42/LFL_SPY_101SpySecrets_250x250.jpg" alt=""></a>Khashoggi isn’t the only Deep State actor in the Palm Beach milieu connected to Trump – take, for example, billionaire Carl Icahn, who Trump has mused about making <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/emmagoldberg/2016/07/25/sheldon-adelson-carl-icahn-and-other-forbes-picks-for-a-possible-trump-billionaire-cabinet/#37e5c77621be" target="_blank">Secretary of Treasury in his potential administration</a>. Icahn, <a href="http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=22427793" target="_blank">who is also an associate of Khashoggi</a>, is known to Florida locals for his “investment” in a St. Petersburg airline whose only product “<a href="http://www.madcowprod.com/2016/03/09/donald-trump-palm-beach-homies/" target="_blank">turned out to be 5.5 tons of cocaine busted on a company plane,</a>” as Hopsicker puts it.</p>
<p>Trump’s connections to international intelligentsia’s drug trade go beyond even the figures mentioned in the aforementioned Hopsicker article; when The Donald proclaimed earlier this year that Richard Haas, long-time President of the Council on Foreign Relations, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/03/03/donald-trump-held-briefing-with-richard-haass-head-of-council-on-foreign-relations/" target="_blank">was one of the few men that he “really likes and respects,”</a> I began in earnest looking for more associative connections between Trump and the Anglo-American Establishment.</p>
<p>While the majority of the Mainstream Media has seen fit to paint Trump as <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/15/technology/silicon-valley-writes-a-protest-letter-against-trump.html" target="_blank">a pariah within the Silicon Valley community</a>, at least some of its powerbrokers, its true movers and shakers, find themselves in Trump’s camp. One such character of prominence is Peter Thiel, a founding member of the aptly-named “PayPal Mafia” and witting CIA cybersecurity subcontractor. A vocal Trump supporter who was given a prime speaking slot at this year’s Republican Convention, most were keen on focusing solely upon superficial banalities like Thiel’s sexual preferences.</p>
</p>
<p>Far more important are the multinational giants he’s built over the years, foremost of which is PayPal. Already suspected <a href="http://www.boilingfrogspost.com/2013/12/11/bfp-breaking-news-omidyars-paypal-corporation-said-to-be-implicated-in-withheld-nsa-documents/" target="_blank">to be complicit in colluding with NSA</a>, it’s almost inconceivable to think that one of the largest payment processors in the world <em>isn’t </em>also involved in drug trade money laundering.</p>
<p>Evidence for this claim comes from HSBC whistleblower John Cruz. As a British bank established in Hong Kong for the <a href="https://www.rt.com/op-edge/330781-drug-smuggling-hsbc-crimes/" target="_blank">express intent of handling profits from the burgeoning opium trade</a>, Mr. Cruz’s former employers are hardly strangers to the drug game. They also prove to be a bit of a one-trick pony, as their documented cooperation in <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-hsbc-probe-idUSBRE8BA05M20121211" target="_blank">laundering the dirty cash of Mexican drug lords</a> proves that not much has changed about HSBC’s business model in over a century.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5Y4UGPQTLg" target="_blank">a video interview</a> interview with Richard Grove of <a href="http://peacerevolution.podomatic.com/" target="_blank">Tragedy and Hope</a>, Cruz outlines how Thiel’s PayPal finds its way into HSBC’s drug kingdom:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Richard Grove: What in your daily work did you start seeing and what started to raise your awareness?</p>
<p>John Cruz: I would see other accounts [under the same Social Security number] beyond the accounts of an individual listed as “Unidentified.” And I would see hundreds, millions, billions, trillions of dollars going through these accounts around the world. And they would just say, “money to, money from,” “transfer in, transfer out.”</p>
<p>And they were just not complete as far as what the money was from. Then you couldn’t find out where the money was coming from, you couldn’t find out where it was going to… <strong>you had money going in and out of PayPal and American Express every day in denominations</strong>, I mean, on your account alone<strong> you could have millions going through PayPal and American Express in 20, 30, 40, 50, 100,000 dollar denominations, even numbers, every day</strong>. But you as the main account holder, in your main accounts, could not see this because they’re coded not to print statements. Not to have access to. <strong>And they’re labeled as “Unidentified.”</strong></p>
<p>So when you see an account with a billion dollars going through it in one day and you have hundreds of thousands of Social Security numbers attached to that one account? Very suspicious.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 style="text-align: center"><a href="http://activistpost.net/icloak.html" target="_blank">This little device delivers turnkey Internet privacy and security (Ad)</a></h4>
<p>Very suspicious, indeed. I’d highly recommend the curious reader listen to the entire interview linked above – but to contrast this network of associations with The Donald himself, one is forced to question if Trump’s rhetoric about drugs and “building a Great Wall” are less about stopping their flow and more about ensuring that only those with DC9s and C130s make their way safely to American markets:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We are going to build a great border wall to stop illegal immigration, to stop the gangs and the violence, and to stop the drugs from pouring into our communities.”</p>

<h3>The Donald and the Transhuman Technocrats</h3>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/patriotprivacy.html"><img class="alignright" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-87TN97qvUkI/Vglq4samFUI/AAAAAAAACBo/3KM84rzs47g/s250-Ic42/Eyeball-ad-300x2501-300x250.png" alt=""></a>Peter Thiel is not your average Silicon Valley tycoon; his belief, <em>his faith</em>, in the technostructure borders on the religious. Admittedly, the odds of finding someone working in tech who’s not an ardent futurist are increasingly low – but Peter Thiel is a man who believes he <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-07-21/the-strange-politics-of-peter-thiel-trump-s-most-unlikely-supporter" target="_blank">can literally cheat death and live forever</a>. He’s not merely a technocrat, he is a transhumanist, and a devout one at that.</p>
<p>Thiel also self-identifies as a “libertarian,” a strange choice of words for a man whose company, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palantir_Technologies" target="_blank">Palantir, is perhaps one of the most heavily government-subsidized cybersecurity contractors on the planet</a>. It’s also no secret that, in addition to a cast of dubious hedge fund managers, Palantir’s largest .gov financier is none other than In-Q-Tel, the CIA’s venture capital firm. Quite a large degree of hypocrisy from a man <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/peter-thiel-competition-is-for-losers-1410535536" target="_blank">who said in a 2014 <em>Wall Street Journal</em> Op-Ed</a>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I’m not interested in illegal bullies or government favorites: By ‘monopoly,’ I mean the kind of company that is so good at what it does that no other firm can offer a close substitute.”</p>
<p>-Peter Thiel</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Really, now? Are government favorites like PayPal, operating on the SWIFT and Fed Wire systems, exempt from this definition? Or government favorites like Palantir, who are paid massive sums of looted taxpayer dollars to build software that tracks, traces, and surveils the very populace that unwittingly funds it? Thiel’s true character, <em>nothing short of a vulture</em>, is demonstrated in the same op-ed when he “upgrades” the age-old quote from John D. Rockefeller who famously said, “Competition is a sin.”</p>
<p>Thiel’s 21st Century equivalent:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<strong>Competition is for losers</strong>. If you want to create and capture lasting value, look to build a monopoly.”</p>
<p>-Peter Thiel</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Transhumanism, monopoly, and the worst of crony capitalism? A dangerous combination, especially in a man who seems to conjure up the worst elements of Science Fiction in the companies he touches. Also a dangerous man to have anywhere near the levers of power, but given Thiel’s entrenched nature within the “Cybersecurity State,” he will inevitably play a role in The Donald’s administration – to the bane of <em>real libertarians </em>the world over.</p>
<p>But the “PayPal Mafia” Don is hardly the only individual with transhuman ideals who The Donald keeps close. As the officially “unofficial” Trump spokesman, consummate insider and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich is doubtlessly gunning for a potential Trump Cabinet position. Gingrich has said of Trump, “<em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO-NA73FsW8" target="_blank">He’s not them. He’s not part of the club. He hasn’t been through the Initiation Rites, he doesn’t belong to the Secret Society.</a></em>”</p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>The same, of course, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpiLARg87FU" target="_blank">cannot be said of Gingrich himself</a>, as he is among the more high-profile attendees of the Bohemian Grove. Newt doesn’t limit his involvement with the “Mystery Schools” to Germanic festivities in Northern California, though; he is something of a priest in the modern mystery school of transhumanism, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/bioecon-%28%23%20023SUPP%29%20NSF-NBIC.pdf" target="_blank">having co-authored the infamous NBIC Report and personally coined the term, “The Age of Transitions.”</a></p>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“While American science and technology benefit the entire world, it is vital to recognize that technological superiority is the fundamental basis of the economic prosperity and national security of the United States. <strong>We are in an Age of Transitions</strong>, when we must move forward if we are not to fall behind, and we must be ready to chart a course forward through constantly shifting seas and winds. Organizations of all kinds, including government itself, must become agile, reinventing themselves frequently while having the wisdom to know which values are fundamental and must be preserved.”</p>
<p>-Newt Gingrich</p>

<p>Newt Gingrich’s segment of the NBIC Report is a fascinating read – and not just for what it sees for the future, nor simply in outlining Newt’s own feelings on the “Age of Transitions,” but in demonstrating the breadcrumbs of suppressed history that have lead us to this point. Gingrich aptly opens his dialogue by mentioning <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj6ADC8ezxk&amp;index=3&amp;list=PL62A73B83932C4E4D" target="_blank">Vannevar Bush, inventor of MEMEX and the precursor to the modern multimedia age</a>.</p>
<p>For more on the transhuman gambit and Newt Gingrich’s role in it, there is an excellent documentary by filmmaker Aaron Franz on the topic:</p>
<p><iframe frameborder="0" width="854" height="640" src="https://www.dailymotion.com/embed/video/x2lxe7s" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay"></iframe></p>
<p>Regardless of who is (s)elected as the next President of the United States, the next administration will oversee vast changes to Internet infrastructure (and the Panopticon it supports). Be it the handover of <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/an-internet-giveaway-to-the-u-n-1472421165" target="_blank">DNS from America to the U.N.</a>, <a href="https://www.corbettreport.com/interview-865-new-world-next-week-with-james-evan-pilato/" target="_blank">net neutrality</a>, or the draconian <a href="https://www.corbettreport.com/smart-tyranny-how-to-resist-the-smart-grid/" target="_blank">“Internet of Things” and “Smart Grid,”</a> the barrel of Technofeudalism’s gun is quickly finding itself turned on humanity at large, if it hasn’t been aimed in that direction all along.</p>
<p>With people like Thiel and Gingrich gearing up to spearhead a “Technological Trump” administration, disarming the State from the top-down in this regard seems an increasingly unlikely outcome.</p>
<p>Or were you really under the impression that we could “Make America Great Again” and restore manufacturing <em>without </em>robots, automation, and artificial intelligence?</p>
<h3>Make America What, Again?</h3>
<p>Regardless of how one feels about Donald Trump, his numerous connections with the Deep State and key actors within it are <em>utterly undeniable</em>. Whether they are <em>utterly indefensible</em> is ultimately left to the reader. But the primary sources and interlocks outlined throughout this article aren’t merely “guilt by association.” <strong>This is how the intelligence community itself maps out potential “threat vectors” when tracking their own targets</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“People use human networks to organize the control of resources and geography. No person alone can control anything of significance. <strong>Presidents, drug lords and CEOs rely on people to execute their strategies</strong> and are constrained by the capabilities and interests of the people who work for them. <strong>Identifying these networks may be a daunting task depending on the network</strong>. For obvious reasons, criminal organizations and militant networks strive to keep their membership secret, and it is not always apparent who gives the orders and who carries out the orders in a political body. To discern who’s who in a group, and therefore whether an individual matters in a group, requires both intelligence and analysis to make sense of the intelligence.”</p>

<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/backyardliberty.html" rel="nofollow"><img class="alignleft" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-dJ7RdhFA2ok/URWUiYEYTcI/AAAAAAAAUIc/ldmH4YgMDj0/s200/imgad2200.gif" alt=""></a>Admittedly, the network outlined herein is a rudimentary one and requires more fleshing out. But for all his “anti-Globalist, Amerika First” rhetoric, Donald Trump finds himself at the center of two key Globalist enterprises: The Deep State drug trade and the Technofeudal State’s transhuman gambit. While The Donald has done a masterful job in dressing himself up as antithetical to these interests, an Administration is not just a President – <em>it’s the support network of the seemingly immortal Deep State actors</em> that supports them.</p>
<p>And Donald Trump is most certainly <em>from the network.</em> But is he <em>for </em>the network?</p>
<p>In this author’s mind, Donald’s Deep State connections belie three potential scenarios:</p>
<ol>
<li>Donald Trump is analogous to the John F./Joe Kennedy complex before him. He may be supported by a criminal enterprise and surrounded by unsavory characters, the Deep State may have leverage over him, but he ultimately has a “Good Heart” and seeks genuine change despite the uphill battle.</li>
<li>Donald Trump is a Deep State actor from a competing group of insiders, putting pressure on the “Old Order” crowd of the Bush/Clinton Cartel in making way for the “New Multipolar World Order” now emerging.</li>
<li>Donald Trump is a Deep State actor running solely for the aims of the Deep State itself. He is a part of it, complicit in it, and whether he wins or loses is immaterial to the greater objectives of World Order.</li>
</ol>
<p>I’m a cynical sod with this crazy belief that <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_yaENlXGa4" target="_blank">only individuals working in concert with other individuals of their own free will</a> </em>can ever change Humanity’s current predicament, and thus, lean heavily towards Options #2 and #3. But for those starry-eyed dreamers who place their faith in the God of the State, here’s to hoping that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iU83R7rpXQY" target="_blank">your next King of choice </a><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iU83R7rpXQY" target="_blank">does not become a sacrificial one</a>.</em></p>

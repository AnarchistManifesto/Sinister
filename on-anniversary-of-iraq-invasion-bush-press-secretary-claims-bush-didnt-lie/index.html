<p id="17e0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Here is a transcript of the full thread by Fleischer:</p>
<blockquote id="cd53" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">
<p>The Iraq war began sixteen years ago tomorrow. There is a myth about the war that I have been meaning to set straight for years. After no WMDs were found, the left claimed “Bush lied. People died.” This accusation itself is a lie. It’s time to put it to rest.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="0fbc" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">
<p>The fact is that President Bush (and I as press secretary) faithfully and accurately reported to the public what the intelligence community concluded. The CIA, along with the intelligence services of Egypt, France, Israel and others concluded that Saddam had WMD. We all turned out to be wrong. That is very different from lying.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="f07b" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">
<p>After the war, a bipartisan group was created to determine what went wrong, particularly why the intelligence community’s conclusions about Iraq were so different from what was found on the ground after the war. The group of experts was named the Robb-Silberman commission. It’s report was issued in March 2005. <a class="markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor" href="http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/wmd/report/report.html#overview" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-href="http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/wmd/report/report.html#overview">It can be found in full here</a>. Its key finding was that that a “major intelligence failure” took place. It also stated that no intelligence service was pressured by the Bush Administration to conclude that Saddam had WMDs.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="982a" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">
<p>Here are the key quotes from their report:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="db94" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--blockquote">
<p>“Overall Commission Finding: The Intelligence Community’s performance in assessing Iraq’s pre-war weapons of mass destruction programs was a major intelligence failure.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="3344" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">
<p>Nuclear Weapons Summary Finding: The Intelligence Community seriously misjudged the status of Iraq’s alleged nuclear weapons program in the 2002 NIE and other pre-Iraq war intelligence products. This misjudgment stemmed chiefly from the Community’s failure to analyze correctly Iraq’s reasons for attempting to procure high-strength aluminum tubes.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="e5ae" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">
<p>Biological Warfare Summary Finding: The Intelligence Community seriously misjudged the status of Iraq’s biological weapons program in the 2002 NIE and other pre-war intelligence products. The primary reason for this misjudgment was the Intelligence Community’s heavy reliance on a human source — codenamed ‘Curveball’ — whose information later proved to be unreliable.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="cd2b" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">
<p>Chemical Warfare Summary Finding: The Intelligence Community erred in its 2002 NIE assessment of Iraq’s alleged chemical warfare program. The Community’s substantial overestimation of Iraq’s chemical warfare program was due chiefly to flaws in analysis and the paucity of quality information collected. In the case of Iraq, collectors of intelligence absorbed the prevailing analytic consensus and tended to reject or ignore contrary information. The result was ‘tunnel vision’ focusing on the Intelligence Community’s existing assumptions. The Intelligence Community did not make or change any analytic judgments in response to political pressure to reach a particular conclusion, but the pervasive conventional wisdom that Saddam retained WMD affected the analytic process. The CIA took too long to admit error in Iraq, and its Weapons Intelligence, Nonproliferation, and Arms Control Center actively discouraged analysts from investigating errors.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="66c5" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">
<p>Finally, we closely examined the possibility that intelligence analysts were pressured by policymakers to change their judgments about Iraq’s nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons programs. The analysts who worked Iraqi weapons issues universally agreed that in no instance did political pressure cause them to skew or alter any of their analytical judgments.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="b609" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">
<p>That is what the investigators reported, after been given full access to people throughout the intelligence community. Which leads me to conclude that there was a liar and his name was Saddam Hussein. He created an elaborate system of lies to fool western intelligence services and he succeeded. He wanted us to believe he had WMDs.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="1576" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">
<p>The allegaton that “Bush lied. People died” is a liberal myth created to politically target President Bush. I understand the anger that was felt after no WMDs were found. But that doesn’t justify calling the President a liar. I can only hope that serious historians and other experts do their homework and resist falling for this myth.</p>

It is an absolute proven fact that George W Bush and his administration <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2011/12/leadup-iraq-war-timeline/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2011/12/leadup-iraq-war-timeline/">lied extensively</a> about the degree of certainty in intelligence regarding Saddam Hussein possessing weapons of mass destruction, having ties to Al Qaeda, and seeking nuclear weapons, all of which (along with Vice President Cheney’s claim that the US invaders would be “<a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/3080244/ns/meet_the_press/t/transcript-sept/#.XJIj5xMzbq0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/3080244/ns/meet_the_press/t/transcript-sept/#.XJIj5xMzbq0">greeted as liberators</a>”) proved false. The Bush administration did not know the things they claimed to know with any degree of certainty, but they claimed that they were certain in order to manufacture support for war. Claiming to know something you do not know is lying, especially when it’s to advance an ulterior motive.</p>
<p id="1cec" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Evidence from intelligence sources, secret communications and statements by people now in custody reveal that Saddam Hussein aids and protects terrorists, including members of Al Qaeda,” Bush <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/onpolitics/transcripts/bushtext_012803.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/onpolitics/transcripts/bushtext_012803.html">claimed in January 2003</a>. “Secretly, and without fingerprints, he could provide one of his hidden weapons to terrorists, or help them develop their own.”</p>

<p id="6717" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“We are absolutely sure they have continued to develop weapons of mass destruction, and we are sure they have in their possession weapons of mass destruction,” Secretary of State Colin Powell <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/world/powell-absolutely-sure-iraq-has-weapons-of-mass-destruction-79445.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/world/powell-absolutely-sure-iraq-has-weapons-of-mass-destruction-79445.html">said in December 2002</a>.</p>
<p id="28a6" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“My colleagues, every statement I make today is backed up by sources, solid sources,” Powell told the United Nations Security Council in his infamous <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.theage.com.au/national/full-text-of-colin-powells-speech-20030206-gdv6o3.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://www.theage.com.au/national/full-text-of-colin-powells-speech-20030206-gdv6o3.html">Iraq presentation</a> in February 2003. “These are not assertions.

<p id="97c3" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“People will continue to debate this issue, but there is no doubt in my mind,” Powell said in the same presentation. “These illicit procurement efforts show that Saddam Hussein is very much focused on putting in place the key missing piece from his nuclear weapons program, the ability to produce fissile material.”</p>

<p id="af14" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">For starters, Rafid Ahmed Alwan al-Janabi, who was cited in Powell’s presentation and who Fleischer refers to by the code name “Curveball” in the above thread, <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://youtu.be/lxerr_iGRXE" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://youtu.be/lxerr_iGRXE">was known to have been lying</a> about bioweapons long before the invasion. Despite the confident assertions made by the Bush administration about Janabi’s claims to the public, no American personnel were present when he made those claims, and he <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/feb/16/colin-powell-cia-curveball" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/feb/16/colin-powell-cia-curveball">told the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Guardian</em> in 2011</a>that the BND (the German intelligence agency who interrogated him) had known he was lying all along.</p>
<p id="a924" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“The BND [German intelligence] knew in 2000 that I was lying after they talked to my former boss, Dr Bassil Latif, who told them there were no mobile bioweapons factories,” Janabi said. “For 18 months after that they left me alone because they knew I was telling lies even though I never admitted it. Believe me, back then, I thought the whole thing was over for me. Then all of a sudden [in the run up to the 2003 invasion] they came back to me and started asking for more details about what I had told them. I still don’t know why the BND then passed on my information to the CIA and it ended up in Powell’s speech.”</p>
<p id="9d5f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Colonel Lawrence Wilkerson was Powell’s chief of staff and helped him prepare his UN presentation on Iraq. When asked on MSNBC if he believed he was lied to about Janabi following the 2011 revelation, Wilkerson <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://youtu.be/lxerr_iGRXE?t=204" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://youtu.be/lxerr_iGRXE?t=204">told Cenk Uygur</a> that “I cannot come to any other conclusion, especially when I have discovered that no US personnel were present when Curveball was interrogated by the BND, the German intelligence service. That we accepted that, that we even had a head of the European division for the CIA, Tyler Drumheller, who at the last minute during Powell’s preparation, during my preparation of the secretary, had told both Tenet and McLaughlin that Curveball might not be reliable. That information was never relayed to the Secretary of State, or to me. I have some serious doubts about it now. I think there was some manipulation of this material, and there was some outright lying.”</p>

Some choice excerpts:</p>
<p id="4ce1" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">“Our assessments rely heavily on analytic assumptions and judgment rather than hard evidence. The evidentiary base is particularly sparse for Iraqi nuclear programs.”</em></p>

<p id="d56c" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Military action was now seen as inevitable,” the document reads. “Bush wanted to remove Saddam, through military action, justified by the conjunction of terrorism and WMD.

The classified version contained dissents from the consensus and language which made it clear that the reader was reading assessments and opinions by the CIA and other intelligence agencies, whereas the unclassified version saw these things deleted, presenting the assessments as absolute fact.</p>

In this document right here, the CIA and 15 other U.S. intelligence agencies use words like this, ‘we assess that’ or ‘we judge that’ Hussein has weapons of mass destruction. This document here is the white paper that was given to you folks here in Congress and the American people. And the words ‘we assess that’ or ‘we judge that’ were removed, meaning that you folks here heard a fact, and in fact, it was only an opinion.</p>

Guesses presented as fact. Opinions presented as proof. That’s a lie. Bush lied. We know this with as much certainty as his administration was pretending to have in the lead-up to the Iraq invasion. There was a pre-existing agenda to invade Iraq, and justifications were advanced to provide an excuse for that invasion with such extreme aggression that now-National Security Advisor John Bolton literally <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://theintercept.com/2018/03/29/john-bolton-trump-bush-bustani-kids-opcw/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" data-href="https://theintercept.com/2018/03/29/john-bolton-trump-bush-bustani-kids-opcw/">threatened to murder an international official’s children</a> for making diplomacy work with Saddam.</p>

His comments read as follows:</p>
<blockquote id="13b6" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">
<p>About ten days after 9/11, I went through the Pentagon and I saw Secretary Rumsfeld and Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz. I went downstairs just to say hello to some of the people on the Joint Staff who used to work for me, and one of the generals called me in.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="0f3a" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">
<p>He said, “Sir, you’ve got to come in and talk to me a second.” I said, “Well, you’re too busy.” He said, “No, no.” He says, “We’ve made the decision we’re going to war with Iraq.” This was on or about the 20th of September. I said, “We’re going to war with Iraq? Why?” He said, “I don’t know.” He said, “I guess they don’t know what else to do.” So I said, “Well, did they find some information connecting Saddam to al-Qaeda?” He said, “No, no.” He says, “There’s nothing new that way. They just made the decision to go to war with Iraq.” He said, “I guess it’s like we don’t know what to do about terrorists, but we’ve got a good military and we can take down governments.” And he said, “I guess if the only tool you have is a hammer, every problem has to look like a nail.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="83b3" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">
<p>So I came back to see him a few weeks later, and by that time we were bombing in Afghanistan. I said, “Are we still going to war with Iraq?” And he said, “Oh, it’s worse than that.” He reached over on his desk. He picked up a piece of paper. And he said, “I just got this down from upstairs” — meaning the Secretary of Defense’s office — “today.” And he said, “This is a memo that describes how we’re going to take out seven countries in five years, starting with Iraq, and then Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and, finishing off, Iran.” I said, “Is it classified?” He said, “Yes, sir.” I said, “Well, don’t show it to me.” And I saw him a year or so ago, and I said, “You remember that?” He said, “Sir, I didn’t show you that memo! I didn’t show it to you!”</p>

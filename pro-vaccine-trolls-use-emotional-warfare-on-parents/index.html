<p><b><i>The Value of Your Child’s Life – According to Those Promoting Vaccines</i></b></p>
<p><a href="https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/baby-value-e13705217614691.jpg" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img border="0" height="133" src="https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/baby-value-e1370521761469.jpg" width="200"></a>Markus Heinze<br />
<b><a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2013/06/pro-vaccine-trolls-use-emotional.html" target="_blank">Activist Post</a></b></p>
<p>Most mothers and fathers vividly remember the days they took their child for shots, filled with anxiety, knowing it would be painful for the child and not knowing how the child will react to the vaccine. As I spent some time researching how those people who tell parents vaccines are safe respond to questions and uncertainties from parents, I came across the following:</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>Use emotional warfare on those questioning vaccines. Tell emotional stories full of tears and sobbing and unbearable grief and terror, about people in your own family or people you read about, who were sick with or died of terrible diseases. Don’t hold back details about bodily fluids and suchlike: the more gross the better. This stuff has a way of infiltrating the minds of parents, subtly influencing their decisions, in a manner similar to advertising. [1]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>The Vaccine Controversy</b></p>
<p>Later we will revisit the last paragraph. For now, let us wonder why there is a controversy surrounding vaccines. To provide you with a bigger picture of what is causing a vaccine controversy, let me back up and provide you with one personal aspect. Stay with me as the reason for a vaccine controversy unfolds.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>When our daughter was born I was overcome with emotions I had never experienced before, emerging feelings of immense joy holding a miracle in my arms, so innocent, vulnerable and sweet. I made a solemn promise to my daughter, right then, right there:  that I would always be there for her, protect her, educate her and never walk the path of least resistance. After all, this child had been entrusted to me and I am responsible to provide her with the best life she can possibly live.</p>

<p>
We are proactive parents. From the very beginning, I researched the safest car seat for my child, my wife did a good job breast feeding, and we have worked hard on stimulating our children intellectually. As a native of Germany, I clearly knew that I would give my children the gift of bilingualism. Prior to birth, I had already ordered an abundance of German books, picture cards, etc., to assist me in my endeavor of raising a German-speaking child in an English-speaking environment.</p>
<p>I vividly remember driving with our daughter to the hospital when she was 22 months old to see her newborn brother for the first time. We conversed in German the entire time and it struck me that my child spoke German much better than English despite the fact that she spent more time with English-speaking people (her nanny, mom, grandparents, etc.). I accomplished that incredible task by completely sacrificing myself and placing my daughter first.</p>
<p>When our son came along this task increased in difficulty. By the time our daughter was three she spoke German and English equally fluently. She is now five, still speaks both languages fluently, and she is beginning to read and write in both languages. We are going on long bike rides, she riding her own bike (she went on her first ten-mile bike ride without supporting wheels at the age of three), and my son is in a ‘bike seat’ behind me as we sing German songs and tell stories.</p>
<p><b>One Shot Changing Four Lives – Forever</b></p>
<p>Unfortunately, this is only part of our story. In 2011, when my oldest child was three and a half years old, we followed our pediatrician’s recommendation to catch up on some shots. That particular day, our daughter received one particular vaccine.</p>
<p>Twenty-four hours after that vaccine, she developed a horrific viral infection. Within the next few days, she started to have mood swings, became thirstier and needed to use the bathroom more often. Thirty days after the vaccine and 29 days after the rash, our daughter was diagnosed with type-1 diabetes.</p>
<p>During our first night in the hospital with our daughter, my wife and I looked at each other knowing that this would change our lives drastically. We agreed that we want our daughter to grow up feeling as carefree as possible and not feeling handicapped by her autoimmune disorder. My wife quit her teaching job the next day and became a homeschooling mother while managing type-1 diabetes.</p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

Our daughter and son excel at their school work and cognitive and physical development, all the while not being impacted by type-1 diabetes.</p>
<p>In the days following our daughter’s diagnosis, I also had to make a decision: do I accept our daughter’s condition as ‘fate,’ despite knowing differently? What about the promise I made to my child at birth? We already established an environment for her to receive the best possible treatment, management and education. Where does this lead me as the father of my child?</p>
<p><b>The Beginning After the Injury</b></p>
<p>As I witnessed my child regressing into an autoimmune disorder immediately post-vaccination, I would have been highly irresponsible and negligent to continue to harm my child by continue to having her vaccinated. I wanted, however, to learn if there were other cases of vaccine-injured children and perhaps even medical professionals, researchers and scientific evidence to know what I had experienced first-hand.</p>
<p>That was the beginning of my research journey. Yes, there are other cases, many cases and many medical professionals, researchers and scientific literature pointing towards vaccine dangers and vaccines not preventing, but causing, illness. Writing as I researched, I shared some of my findings in my book VACCeptable Injuries?</p>
<p>Having found the cause for my daughters ‘injustice’ and having stopped it from further harming her through more vaccines, I knew my responsibilities toward my child had not been met. I began to research major diabetes foundations like the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, the American Diabetes Association, the Joslin Diabetes Center and the Diabetes Research Institute. Even though all four organizations have contributed amazingly and wonderfully to the development of managing type-1 diabetes better today than ever (for which I am very thankful), I questioned whether their efforts will contribute to a cure.</p>
<p>The Juvenile Diabetes Cure Alliance found that “None of the major diabetes charities has set a time goal for a cure, and only one of the four, the DRIF, has adopted a definition of a cure.” [2] As I am missing the urgency from the mainstream diabetes organizations to find a cure, I felt that my responsibility as the father of my child is to engage in my own research. But now, back to vaccines.</p>
<p>As vaccines are administered to all children regardless of their differences (one size fits all), I am being rewarded through my research – tailored towards my individual child – to have found people, medical doctors, researchers, nurses, scientific articles and natural doctors to supplement the insulin treatment of our child.</p>
<p>My research has also led me to find a wonderful pediatrician who actually projects ethics in believing that parents, NOT PHARMACCEUTICAL COMPANIES, NOT THE GOVERNMENT AND NOT DOCTORS know their children best and should be the decision makers. He doesn’t push us to vaccinate, despite being pro-vaccine.</p>
<p><b>The Stories Parents Are Told to Avoid</b></p>
<p>I also found many other stories of vaccine-injured children:</p>
<p>You may find the story of ‘Little Ben’ to be very informative, whose family was rewarded one of the largest settlements in vaccine court for irreversible brain damage: <a href="http://www.littlebentrust.com/">http://www.littlebentrust.com/</a></p>
<p>Another heartbreaking story is that of Lisa Mark Smith who was severely injured by the flu vaccine. Her life and that of her family will never be the same: <a href="http://www.vacceptableinjuries.com/2013/05/a-mothers-flu-shot-nightmare-unedited.html">http://www.vacceptableinjuries.com/2013/05/a-mothers-flu-shot-nightmare-unedited.html</a></p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/vaccinetruth.html" style="float: right;margin-left: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-MkKSFqq5-DE/TfAbRwTtoXI/AAAAAAAAJRE/itK2KofpgVU/VACCINE-BANNER.gif" alt=""></a>Lisa’s story is also available in Vaccine Epidemic, available at Amazon.com.</p>
<p>Another of tens of thousands of stories from vaccine-injured children is that of Caroline. Caroline was a happy, healthy, playful baby … until six months of age when she received the DTaP, IPV/OPV, Hep B, PCV7 and a flu shot, all at her six-month well child visit. After that, she began exhibiting a shaking behavior any time her excitement or sensations became more than she could process: <a href="http://regardingcaroline.com/index.html">http://regardingcaroline.com/index.html</a></p>
<p>A vaccine controversy exists, because every day children are injured by vaccines and families’ lives are changed forever by a medical intervention that has never been proven to be safe and effective in the first place.</p>
<p><b>The Value of the Individual Child</b></p>
<p>In his article <i>The Value of Life, Statistically Speaking</i>, Rick Jones explains that<i> “healthy children may suffer adverse reactions, injury, or even death,” but “for vaccines, the enormous societal benefits trump the tragedies of the few.”</i> [3]</p>
<p>In other words: the individual child matters nothing compared to the masses. This attitude seems contrary to the value we place on the individual within our society. American educators are trained to recognize and understand the differences in children. American schools prioritize the fact that <i>“students are all different. That is what makes students unique and interesting human beings.”</i> [4]</p>
<p>My teachers always told me that there was nothing worse than following blindly, as in doing so, I was empowering a group of a few to make decisions for the masses. Some of my teachers had seen Nazism and Stalinism and knew very well what they were talking about.</p>
<p>There are great dangers involved in riding any bandwagon. Once we parents take our seats on the bandwagon, we are no longer leading our families—we are simply fellow passengers along with our children. We are no longer the ones making decisions for ourselves or our kids—we have ceded this important responsibility to whomever is driving that particular bandwagon. And this is a mistake.</p>
<p>In any wagonload of people, the needs of individual passengers may differ greatly, and what might be good for some of the passengers might be quite dangerous—even deadly—for others. And if ‘others’ is our child, it is our responsibility—not the driver’s—to foresee the danger and keep her from taking that deadly trip. [5]</p>
<p><b>Asking You to Be a Bad Parent</b></p>
<p>The American Academy of Pediatrics asks the following rhetorical question: “Do you treat all your children alike?” before elaborating on the subject of what makes GOOD parents: “Probably not. You should relate to and treat each youngster differently. Treating each child as an individual is part of what makes that child a unique person and is a way of appreciating his special characteristics.” [6]</p>
<p>In this article the Academy provides many reasons for treating your children differently and uniquely. When it comes to injecting your child with potentially lethal toxins via vaccines, however, the ‘one size fits all’ method is applied as the Academy of Pediatrics calls for all children to be vaccinated using the same dosage regardless of weight, heritage or having thoroughly examined each child for potential side effects.</p>
<p>At babies’ birth or two months of age, their parents have few clues how their newborn responds to different external stimuli. There are no thorough physical exams performed before subjecting babies to several shots at the same time. All of which is contrary to the notion of “know your child and treat her according to her unique needs.”</p>

<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/vaccineexempt.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-WfI77BHRfFg/TpHdZMZJHeI/AAAAAAAALS4/KDabWFqA1jM/s200/AVGLE2.0-CD.jpg"></a>If you are one of those parents living by the principle that each child should be known and treated according to his or her needs, you may find yourself having a problem with the notion of having your child injected with 48 doses of 14 vaccines (if you live in the United States). Or you may be the parent who witnessed your child regressing into illness after receiving routinely administered shots, then saying, “NO MORE.” Should you dare take the story of your vaccine-injured child to the public, you deserve nothing but contempt, according to many health care providers and others promoting vaccines.</p>
<p>In her book Your Baby’s Best Shot, Stacy Herlihy proclaims, “Vaccines are perhaps the greatest health miracle ever known to mankind. Inoculations will protect babies and toddlers from everything from pneumonia to chicken pox.” [7]</p>
<p>It is more than questionable that vaccines provide sufficient protection from illness. To make a benefit-risk analysis is crucial. To read more about the questionable assumption that vaccines sufficiently protect from illness you may find the article “Vaccination – Human Necessity Or Dangerous Ritual?” of interest. You can access it here: <a href="http://www.vacceptableinjuries.com/2013/05/vaccination-human-necessity-or.html">http://www.vacceptableinjuries.com/2013/05/vaccination-human-necessity-or.html</a>.</p>
<p>We should, however, focus on how Mrs. Herlihy – and many others favoring vaccines – answer to those parents questioning her assumption that vaccines are the greatest health miracle. Commenting on the book Vaccine Epidemic, Mrs. Herlihy proclaims that “human rights do NOT include the right to spread diseases to others.” [8]</p>
<div class="code-block code-block-1" style="margin: 0px">
<div align="center" class="mrf-external">
<a href="https://amorain.com/?E=ikLQsSIi%2fgaXBh0SRK5s8g%3d%3d&amp;s1="><img src="https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/500.jpg"></a></p>

</div>
<p>A human right is defined as “any basic right or freedom to which all human beings are entitled and in whose exercise a government may not interfere.” [9] We can only assume that Mrs. Herlihy wishes to be in control of YOUR child, preferably via government control. Further commenting on an alternative point of view, the author ofYour Baby’s Best Shot states that she removed the book Vaccine Epidemic, as an alternate view point “out of the library in complete disgust. This miserable exercise in creative typing is nothing but pages and pages of sheer misinformation by paranoid fools.” [10]</p>
<p>One has to question the very personal insinuations made by the author toward someone creating balance for better decision-making. It seems that Mrs. Herlihy disapproves of everyone going astray from her own point of view. Mrs. Herlihy offers utter contempt for responsible parents questioning the safety and effectiveness of vaccines when she states, “You’re a sad, paranoid, dangerous person with a ridiculous agenda.” [11]</p>
<p>Taking it a step further, Mrs. Herlihy responds to those mothers whose children have been injured or killed by vaccines by writing they are telling “…lies about her daughter’s illness and medical history.” [12] Perhaps caution is advised to read an author who uses ad hominems and pseudoscientific beliefs. Caution is warranted when reading an author who discredits any other viewpoint than her own as lies and insulting the person daring to share the story of her vaccine-injured child.</p>
<p>In summary, you are asked by the vast majority of health officials to override your parental instincts and anxieties following their agenda. If you refuse to subject your child to vaccines you are labeled ‘a bad parent.’ If you disregard your fears and consent to vaccines and your child is harmed in the process, then you are labeled a liar.</p>
<p>Utter caution is advised to blindly follow those who stoop to low levels of rhetoric as they seem to defend a vaccine religion rather than a medical intervention based on sound science. If injecting your child with live and attenuated viruses, as well as potentially lethal toxins, is truly based on sound science, one has to wonder why Mrs. Herlihy – as well as others promoting vaccines – have to stoop to such low personal rhetoric using “emotional warfare on those questioning vaccines.”</p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/vaccineexempt.html" rel="nofollow" style="float: right;margin-left: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em"><img class="noshadow" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-ndvYUapEn5A/TpHdZPRyqyI/AAAAAAAALS0/rUkfbJmy3o0/s240/vaccinexempt2.jpg" style="background:none" alt=""></a>Who knows your child best? Who has to live with consequences resulting from decisions imposed on you by pediatricians or diverse authors, labeling parents as “paranoid,” should they express the ramifications of the child’s vaccine injury?</p>
<p>Good decisions are made by taking all perspectives, arguments and scientific outcomes into consideration. Those advocating for all parents to inject their children with toxic substances via vaccines are also advising to silence voices of thinking otherwise. Their tools are means of “telling emotional stories full of tears, sobbing and unbearable grief and terror and not holding back lies about bodily fluid.” Perhaps, at this point, you should start asking questions of those claiming vaccines are safe and effective.</p>
<p>If Mrs. Herlihy were truly convinced that vaccines are preventing illness in children and are safe for all, she would welcome a scientific and societal debate, as her claims would withstand any scrutiny. Wanting to silence those questioning vaccines by means of intimidation and lies seems to imply that vaccine advocates are hiding something they wish not to be revealed.</p>

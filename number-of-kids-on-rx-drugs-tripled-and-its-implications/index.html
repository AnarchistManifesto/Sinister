<p>According to <i><a href="http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/2013/12/are-too-many-kids-taking-antipsychotic-drugs/index.htm">Consumer Reports</a></i>, “The number of children taking powerful antipsychotic drugs has nearly tripled over the last 10 to 15 years, according to recent research.”</p>
<p>Whooaah! Has anyone done a retrospective study to find if there’s a correlation between antipsychotic drug taking and the increase in violent crimes by members of society younger than 20 years of age?</p>
<p>According to Monica G. Young at <a href="http://naturalnews.com/"><i>NaturalNews.com</i></a>,</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>In the pre-medication era, it was known that with time, people usually recovered from       depression. If kids had tantrums, were unruly or shy, they were apt to outgrow it. Today,         individuals branded with disorders are likely to receive long-lasting diagnoses, endless           prescriptions and the poorer ones tend to remain on disability for life. [1]</p>

<p>Furthermore, how about factoring in this from <i>Consumer Reports</i>,</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p><a name="more"></a>Increasingly, kids are prescribed antipsychotic medications at their pediatrician’s office,    rather than by a psychiatrist. The number of prescriptions for the drugs written by        pediatricians has increased steadily over the last several years and is up nearly 25 percent           since 2006.  [CJF:  Based upon that ‘trajectory’, what should we expect?]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/allen-frances/is-criticism-of-dsm-5-ant_b_3326980.html">Dr. Allen Frances, MD</a>, who is critiquing the risks of the American Psychiatric Association’s new DSM-5, the antidepressant Rx business amounts to US$12Billion a year, while the stimulant drug market comes in at US$7Billion a year – not exactly “small potatoes.”  According to the then-projections, the vaccine market for 2010 was supposed to be about US$19.2Billion with some predicting an average annual growth of sales to amount to 21 percent!</p>

<p>Doesn’t that seem to be what it’s all about – not factual science – but the scientific, medical, and political disregards for the harms of neurotoxins and hazardous chemicals in vaccines, some of which are being steered deliberately into the    human brain?</p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>Comparatively, psychotic prescription drug increase and use in children is nothing compared with the uptake in mandated vaccines, vaccinations, and their toxins for children that starts usually within 24 hours of birth with the Hepatitis B vaccine and barrels along at two-month intervals when infants are taken to their pediatricians for what are called “well-baby” visits at 2, 4, and 6 months of age, only to be pumped with as many as nine (9) vaccines at one time that usually make them have an adverse reaction, minor or serious,  or contribute to life-long health anomalies.</p>
<p><i><b>Now, let’s figure out how many times vaccinations have increased? </b></i></p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/New-Proud-Parents-of-Unvaccinated-Children/113991452086710">a chart provided by <i>Proud Parents of Unvaccinated Children</i></a>, <b>4 vaccines</b> (Smallpox and DTP [Diphtheria, Tetanus, Pertussis (3)] were given to children in the <b>1940s</b>.  Let’s use that number as our base rate for sake of argument. </p>
<p>According to The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), </p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>The smallpox vaccine was discontinued for routine use in the United States in the early     1970s.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/vaccinetruth.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" height="175" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-38G3VOJQToQ/TfAZ2bc-qRI/AAAAAAAAJQ8/LA-TGAvVeWk/250x250-b.jpg" width="200"></a>However, instead of that reducing the number of vaccines given, the number of vaccine doses given in <b>1980 </b>increased to <b>21 vaccines</b>:  DTP [3] &amp; Polio at 2 months; DTP [3] &amp; Polio at 4 months; DTP [3] &amp; Polio at 6 months; MMR [3] (Measles, Mumps, Rubella) at 12 months; DTP [3] at 18 months; DTP [3] at 5 years. </p>
<p>Therefore, the 1980 vaccine/vaccination schedule of 21 vaccine doses resulted in a 5-and-a-quarter times increase over the base [4 vaccines] 1940s vaccination schedule.</p>
<p><b>Juvenile Crime</b></p>
<p>Now, this writer wishes to interject something that will be challenged, but needs to be pointed out: Juvenile crime, which has increased exponentially and dramatically in the time frame after the 1980 mandated vaccine schedule that introduced more toxic chemicals into children’s brains and bodies.</p>
<p>According to the website <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">www.justice.gov/</a>… <b>“The number of teenagers under eighteen arrested for murder has risen over one hundred fifty percent from 1985 to 1994,”</b> as stated in the <i><b>FBI Uniform Crime Reports, 1994</b></i>.  While “Seventeen percent of all serious violent crimes in 1991 were committed by juveniles, either alone (eleven percent) or in juvenile groups (six percent).” [Recall vaccine doses increased 5 ¼ times in 1980.] Other reports are cited stating, “Increasing youth violence has become a national concern, and <b>juvenile arrests are on the rise.</b>” “The most alarming statistics among these increases are the <b>growth in homicides and weapons violations among younger juveniles.</b>” [CJF emphasis added] [Does violence as entertainment also play a role in crime?]</p>
<p><a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/eousa/foia_reading_room/usam/title9/crm00102.htm">http://www.justice.gov/usao/eousa/foia_reading_room/usam/title9/crm00102.htm</a></p>
<p><b>Now, let’s see what the 2012 vaccine/vaccination schedule produced. </b></p>
<p><b>Prenatal:</b> pregnant mother’s H1N1 flu vaccine; Hepatitis B at <b>birth</b>; Dtap [3] (Diphtheria, Tetanus, Acellular Pertussis), Polio, Hib, Pneu, Rotavirus, HepB for a total of <b>8 vaccines at 2 months of age</b>; the very same schedule as at 2 months with no HepB for <b>7 vaccines at 4 months of age</b>; Dtap [3], Polio, Hib, Flu/H1N1 for a total of <b>6 vaccines at 6 months of age</b>; another Flu/H1N1 vaccine at <b>7 months of age</b>; Pneu and MMR [3] for a total of <b>4 vaccines at 12 months of age, or 28 vaccine doses by one year of age.</b>  By the end of the first year of life according to the 2012 vaccination schedule, vaccine doses increased seven (7) times, i.e., 28 vaccine doses,  over the doses given in the 1940s.</p>
<p>Continuing on still, a child receives 19 more vaccine doses by age of 6: Varicella and Hepatitis A <b>[2] vaccines at 15 months old</b>.  The Dtap [3], Polio, Hib, HepA, and Flu/H1N1 for a total of 7 <b>vaccines at 18 months of age.</b>  Another <b>Flu/H1N1 vaccine at 2 ½ years of age.</b>  Between <b>4 and 6 years of age, a child receives 9 vaccines</b> at one time: Dtap [3], Polio, MMR [3], Varicella, and Flu/H1N1.</p>
<p>By a child’s 6th birthday, his or her vaccine/vaccination mandated schedule grew almost <b>12 times over what they were in 1940, for a total of 47 doses of vaccines!</b>  Vaccination schedules increased from only 4 vaccines to almost twelve times that amount or 47 vaccine doses, per this writer’ calculations.</p>
<p>However, there is a caveat to those figures.  They do not include the boosters and newer vaccines, e.g., the HPV vaccines for male and female children up to 18 years of age, which appear on the CDC’s schedule <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/who/teens/downloads/parent-version-schedule-7-18yrs.pdf"><b>here</b></a>. </p>
<p>But we shouldn’t stop there.  Now take a look at the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/downloads/adult/adult-schedule.pdf">recommended vaccination schedule for adults</a>.</p>
<p>If readers have read my October 2013 book, <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Vaccination-Voodoo-What-About-Vaccines/dp/1484923820/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1387371708&amp;sr=8-1-fkmr0&amp;keywords=Vaccination+Voodoo%2C+What+YOU+Don%E2%80%99t+Know+About+Vaccines"><b>Vaccination Voodoo, What YOU Don’t Know About Vaccines</b></a></i>, you can readily understand how many toxic chemicals and neurotoxins are being pumped into infants, toddlers, teens, and adults.  So, can we do a quick guestimate on the increase of those toxins in vaccines over one’s life time? Well, that depends upon how long a person may live, once you study the 2013 Adult Schedule for Immunization in the USA.</p>
<p><b>Who’s to Blame?</b></p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/vaccineexempt.html" rel="nofollow" style="float: right;margin-left: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-WfI77BHRfFg/TpHdZMZJHeI/AAAAAAAALS4/KDabWFqA1jM/s200/AVGLE2.0-CD.jpg" alt=""></a>Furthermore, we know that 300 new vaccines are in development stages.  Question: How will the 2013 vaccination schedules, plus those newbie vaccines, dramatically increase the amount of toxic drugs given to everyone? Exponentially is an accurate answer.  Therefore, is it any wonder that the USA has a totally legal drug culture that keeps growing day by day, and year by year?  And the medical societies are to blame!  They keep ‘sanctifying’ and pushing more and more chemical drugs, especially vaccines, any which way they can into humans, even from before birth using fear tactics and health agency mandates.  This writer remembers a time when <a href="http://www.drugs.com/pregnancy/aspirin.html">not even an aspirin was recommended to be taken by a pregnant woman</a>. </p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>Instead of implementing complementary medicine protocols when appropriate and a holistic approach to lifestyles along with a nutritious, organically-grown, GMO- and chemical-free dietary, the medical profession, federal, and state health agencies keep pushing drugs like any drug dealer does, except their pushing is legal – and in many cases MANDATORY, as with vaccines and chemotherapy for cancer treatments, especially for children when parents prefer other treatments.  Read 11-year-old <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/health/amish-girl-hiding-avoid-forced-cancer-treatment-article-1.1533048">Sarah Hershberger’s sad story</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, citizens do pay the price, rather expressly with adverse events, ill health, or even death in many instances.  </p>
<p>According to Gary Null, PhD,</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>Out of the 783,936 annual deaths from conventional medicine mistakes,            approximately 106,000 of those are the result of prescription drug use. [2]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And still no one is doing anything about it other than fining Big Pharma big fines.  Where do all those big fines go?  Shouldn’t there be an accounting of how those fines are used or spent?  Do they finance the U.S. FDA’s operations?  Or is it a matter of someone scratching someone else’s back?</p>
<p><b>Change IS on the Horizon – not the other kind of change </b></p>
<p>Starting in January 2014, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania will initiate a prescription drug take-back program.  MedReturn collection boxes will be at locations throughout the state so consumers can properly dispose of prescription drugs.  “Abuse of prescription drugs is a serious problem that can lead to addiction, overdose and death,” said DDAP Secretary Gary Tennis. [3]           </p>
<p>The more drugs the medical profession and Big Pharma push into consumers, the more problems.  Antibiotics in food animals are other drug problems that need addressing.  Finally, after all these years of use and abusing antibiotics for fattening animals for market, the FDA is going to do something.  See <a href="http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm378100.htm">“Phasing Out Certain Antibiotic Use in Farm Animals”</a>. Don’t you think those veterinary drugs also put a little more meat and fat on humans’ hindquarters, too, in addition to compromising the human immune system?</p>
<p>But here’s the <i>piece de resistance</i>, as far as this writer is concerned.  It’s a story out of the U.K. about the hyping and issuing of <a href="http://nsnbc.me/2013/05/14/bbc-news-removes-false-claims-about-measles-epidemic-after-being-busted/">false news claims about the measles epidemic earlier this year in Wales</a> that was promoting vaccinations, i.e., the MMR vaccine which many parents don’t want their children vaccinated with. </p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/superfoods.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" class="noshadow" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-N2GOFRKd8Vs/UF4PWWZ5dsI/AAAAAAAARz4/tuwcrewmlWA/s316/herbalcures.png" style="background: none;border: none" width="160"></a>Another equally-enlightening article is <a href="http://nsnbc.me/2013/05/10/the-vaccine-hoax-is-over-freedom-of-information-act-documents-from-uk-reveal-30-years-of-coverup/">“The Vaccine Hoax is Over Documents from UK reveal 30 Years of Cover-up.”</a>  And still they keep on pushing vaccine drugs and people keep on believing the hype.  All this drug-pushing with vaccines, antipsychotics, veterinary antibiotics in animal feeds, plus add to that over 100,000 chemicals that can be used in our environment and food chain, from crop fields to processing to manufacturing- and shipping-chemicals, humans have become walking toxic waste dumps.  On top of all that, add the heavy metals, chemicals, probable viruses, and toxins being sprayed daily over our heads from airplanes that <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=chemtrail+photos&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mo2wUtKkAc7lsASj1YFA&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CCkQsAQ&amp;biw=1018&amp;bih=605">create chemtrails</a>.</p>
<p>All that still does not include the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=fukushima+aerial+plume+maps+in+the+usa&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=aY6wUtmcIYflsAT4qYEo&amp;ved=0CCkQsAQ&amp;biw=1018&amp;bih=605">radioactive waste aerial plumes</a> that flow across the Pacific Ocean from Fukushima.  What does all that do to us, especially infants, toddlers, and teens?</p>
<p><b>Autism</b></p>
<p>Finally, to come full circle, we need to look at the rates of autism over the years?  Autism was first detected by Dr. Leo Kanner, a child psychiatrist at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore.  He first reported about autism in his 1943 paper.  At first autism was called the Kanner syndrome; it was so rare Dr. Kanner did not mention it in many of his publications.</p>
<p>Here are the generally accepted statistics regarding autism:</p>
<ul>
<li>Until about 1970, it is generally believed that the autism rate was one in 10,000.</li>
<li>In 1975: one in 1,500; in 2009: one in 110; in 2012: one in 88; in March 2013: one in 50.</li>
<li>According to some, the rate of autism has increased by 600% in the last 20 years.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Is Correlation Causation?</b></p>
<p>However, there is something that medicine and public health agencies overlook and don’t even want to hear about.  It is this: If one cross-references or juxtaposes the increase in vaccines given to infants, toddlers, and teens according to draconian vaccination mandates, which unequivocally document an almost 12-times increase in the number of vaccine doses given children to age 6 between the timeframe of the 1940s and 2012, there is an apparent correlation rather than coincidence.  It’s about time we stop accepting that vaccines do not harm nor cause damage, and anything that happens after receiving a vaccine is mere coincidence.  That’s nothing but sanitized poppycock!</p>
<p>Furthermore, the U.S. Vaccine Court is proof that something is amiss with vaccines.  That court has paid out close to US$3Billion in vaccine damage claims since its inception in the late 1980s.  As of April 2013, close to US$6Million alone was paid to only 49 victims damaged by the HPV vaccine <a href="http://therefusers.com/refusers-newsroom/us-vaccine-court-pays-6-million-to-gardasil-victims-most-claims-not-yet-settled/#.Uq-t5nt3uGN">(Source)</a>.</p>
<p><b>Other Toxic Issues</b></p>
<p>Before we leave the issue of oversupplying toxic chemicals in drugs to children, let’s consider other products we use daily that compromise us chemically.  Consider what the U.S. FDA recently said about those ‘all important’ antibacterial soaps.   As <i>Food Safety News</i> put it,</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>According to FDA, there is no evidence that antibacterial soaps are any more effective at preventing illness than washing with plain soap and water. Some data even suggest that          long-term exposure to certain active ingredients used in antibacterial products —   <b>triclosan in liquid soaps and triclocarban in bar soaps — could pose health risks,      such as bacterial resistance or hormonal effects</b>. [4] [CJF emphasis added]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Could the hormonal effects implied to antibacterial products be similar to endocrine disruption that comes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisphenol_A">from Bisphenol A (BPA)</a>?  However, BPA’s replacement, BPS, is even more problematic insofar as it is more readily absorbable upon contact.  Ponder this:</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<div class="code-block code-block-1" style="margin: 0px">
<div align="center" class="mrf-external">
<a href="https://amorain.com/?E=ikLQsSIi%2fgaXBh0SRK5s8g%3d%3d&amp;s1="><img src="https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/500.jpg"></a></p>

</div>
<p>The study detected BPS in all the receipt paper they tested, 87 percent of the samples of   paper currency and 52 percent of recycled paper. The researchers estimate that <b>people     may be absorbing BPS through their skin in larger doses than they absorbed BPA         when it was more widely used – 19 times more BPS than BPA. People who handle   thermal paper in their jobs may be absorbing much more BPS.</b> [5] [CJF emphasis added]</p>
<p>This writer contends that society is over-chemicalized – deliberately – either because of pseudo-science or profit-making ventures and proprietary interests seeking spectacular bottom line figures. I discuss those issues in my 2009 book, <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Our-Chemical-Lives-Hijacking-DNA/dp/1439255369/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1387371039&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Our+Chemical+Lives+And+The+Hijacking+Of+Our+DNA%2C+A+Probe+Into+What%E2%80%99s+Probably+Making+Us+Sick"><b>Our Chemical Lives And The Hijacking Of Our DNA, A Probe Into What’s Probably Making Us Sick</b></a></i>.  The number of drugs given to young children, in particular, has more than tripled; how about twelve times for vaccines alone, plus other Rx drugs kids take – and legally!  We have a drug-zombie culture from street drugs and those legally mandated, prescribed or overprescribed, and provided by those who should know better: the medical profession.  How many Rx’s do senior citizens take? </p>
<p>The <i>Wall Street Journal</i> in its December 28, 2010 article “So Young and So Many Pills” [6] printed the exceptional graphic below.  Please study the data associated with each type of medication.  The numbers are astounding!  Why so many children on so many meds? Take a look at sleep aids and statins being prescribed to 0 to 9 year olds!  What’s causing such a ‘pandemic’ of chronic illnesses in the very young? Can it be the synergistic biological interaction of heavy metals in vaccines and other meds, plus all the toxic man-made chemicals humans are mandated to intake in everything from the air we breathe to the water we drink to the food we eat to the clothing we wear to the furniture we sit on to the cars  we drive?</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both;text-align: center"><a href="https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/17.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em;margin-right: 1em"><img border="0" height="345" src="https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/16.jpg" width="400"></a></div>
<p>
When will we wake up enough to realize that we do not have a deficiency of man-made chemicals, especially pharmaceutical drugs foisted upon us in the name of medical science? Actually, we are inundated! When will we finally realize that we and our children are being poisoned in the name of medical science gone off the deep end with its hard core influences in government, business, and the media?  When will we decide enough is enough and stop buying into pseudo-scientific hype, which after many years down the line of our buying into such deceitful hype finds pharmaceuticals are recalled for all the damage they have done?    </p>
<p>Well, finally someone has realized what’s going on with poisoning us, especially children.  </p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>A California Superior Court judge in San Jose ordered three current or former paint           companies to pay $1.1 billion into a fund to be used to clean up hazards from lead           paint in hundreds of thousands of homes in the state. [7]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Incidentally, science, society, and vested interests finally had to accept the problems associated with lead [Pb] and the damage it causes to human health and the environment.  Reluctantly, after decades of tobacco science saying smoking didn’t harm us and that medical doctors preferred certain brands of cigarettes, the tobacco industry has to decorate their brands with truth in advertising like the following:</p>

Take note of the Warning Label regarding fetal injury, premature birth, and low birth weight! Why didn’t such warnings appear earlier than they have?  We need similar ‘bridles’ for the chemical and pharmaceutical industries.  They really are not too big to be made to comply with <i>factual </i>science.</p>
<p><b>It’s Congress’s Fault</b></p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/stepoutsidethebox.html" rel="nofollow" style="float: right;margin-left: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-kADbI3spO2M/TwILKt_It9I/AAAAAAAANvU/F0N-dw_gGR4/s261/cancer.png" alt=""></a>The problem, as this writer sees it, is Congress!  Congress’s unwillingness to take the bull by the horns and do its job of oversight, plus stop taking all the gifts that K Street lobbyists have to offer, which in turn, only buy influence that looks favorably upon introducing or passing laws that vested interests want enacted to protect their corporate interests.  </p>
<p>Seeming examples are Monsanto with non-labeling of GMO edibles in the USA, and the ‘coup’ the pharmaceutical industry was able to pull off in getting the 1986 law President Ronald Reagan signed: the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986, which took away all legal liability for vaccine damage from Big Pharma and vaccine makers, and which undoubtedly has led to the overproduction of a product—vaccines—that is mandated to be given to infants, toddlers, teens, and adults, and which causes horrendous damage and no one is held accountable.  </p>
<p>It seems the more they can get away with, the more they will offer and no one stands in their steamroller way.  What a shame! </p>

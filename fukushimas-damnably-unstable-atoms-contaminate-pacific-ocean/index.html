<p><i>Water is life’s matter and matrix, mother and medium. There is no       life without water.</i> – Albert Szent-Gyorgyi, biochemist       </p>
<p><i>We are all infected and impure with sin. When we display our       righteous deeds, they are nothing but filthy rags. Like autumn       leaves, we wither and fall, and our sins sweep us away like the       wind.</i> – The Bible, Isaiah 64:6       </p>
<p>Over one and a half years has passed since the accident at the       Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power station. Both US scientists, basing       their findings on Japanese government data, and Tokyo Electric       Power Company (Tepco) itself, admit that nuclear reactors are       probably continuing to contaminate the Pacific Ocean with       radiation.       </p>
<p>The way the Establishment treats the issue is revealing, ranging       from mild concern to glib indifference, to blatant double-speak.       While the <i>New York Times</i> has a reputation for standard-setting       journalism, close scrutiny of their reporting (cited below) shows       they promote the best-case scenario while downplaying dangers. The       word “glib” pretty much sums up their style. For example, the NYT       notes at the end of their article that while on the one hand Tepco       denies radiation is leaking into the ocean, Tepco’s “spokesman”       said he could not rule out radiation leaks. NYT leaves it at that       without pursuing the truth of the matter.       </p>
<p><a name="more"></a>It would be impolite for NYT to take Tepco to task too forcefully       and at any rate NYT has a proud and well established record of       promoting perpetual war for perpetual peace, the nuclear weapons       arms race and “atoms for peace” nuclear energy (1).       </p>
<p>Corporate news must be examined for unproved and false       assumptions, distorted and omitted facts, while important       information is often buried at the bottom of the article — “below       the fold” (in the newspaper, pre-computer days’ jargon). Editorial       decisions to isolate and emphasize certain facts and establishment       funded sources as being reliable creates an acceptable narrative       for readers to parrot to their friends while standing around the       water-cooler.       </p>

<b>The Assault On Ocean Health       </b></p>
<p>Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) is is one of the       world’s leading oceanographic institutes and is located in Cape       Cod, Massachusetts, USA. According to Wikipedia, WHOI is       essentially funded by the National Science Foundation, which is       itself a US government agency (2).       </p>
<p>Woods Hole represents one of the more conscientious branches of       the US government, insofar as their monitoring of the health of       the world’s oceans provides an incalculable service. Why is it       WHOI, essentially representing the US, sounds the clarion call       that radiation is continuing to seep into the ocean from the       disaster site, instead of the Japanese government? Tepco has no       interest in exposing their own incompetence and crimes.       </p>
<p>We can assume that WHOI sugar coats their findings and rhetoric       unless they want to lose funding since support for nuclear power       and weapons enjoys bipartisan support in the US congress. The US       military itself dumps more pollution into the Earth’s environment       than any other single organized entity (3). You won’t see WHOI       writing reports about that any time soon.       </p>
<p>Nevertheless, the analysis of one WHOI scientist was enlightening:       <br />

<p>[M]arine chemist Ken Buesseler analyzed data made publicly       available by the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and       Fisheries (MAFF) on radiation levels in fish, shellfish and       seaweed collected at ports and inland sites in and around       Fukushima Prefecture. The picture he draws from the nearly 9,000       samples describes the complex interplay between radionuclides       released from Fukushima and the marine environment…. the vast       majority of fish caught off the northeast coast of Japan remain       below limits for seafood consumption…. bottom-dwelling       fish…consistently show the highest level of contamination by a       radioactive isotope of cesium from the damaged nuclear power       plant. He also points out that levels of contamination in almost       all classifications of fish are not declining, although not all       types of fish are showing the same levels, and some are not       showing any appreciable contamination. As a result, Buesseler       concludes that there may be a continuing source of radionuclides       into the ocean, either in the form of low-level leaks from the       reactor site itself or contaminated sediment on the seafloor(4).       </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Crucially, WHOI admits that contaminated ocean fish are evidence       of an ongoing problem. Cesium, the main effluent from the site       remains a danger for as long as 300 years, but a continuing flow       of radiation would lengthen that time frame every single day.       </p>
<p>Although Buesseler’s findings were presented by mainstream media       as somewhat upsetting news, Buesseler and his team have reported       on the hydrological aspects of radioactive discharges since       October of 2011. WHOI reported on a variety of avenues by which       radioactively contaminated water was reaching the ocean. This       could have been, and could still be from, intentional or       unintentional releases of water used to cool the melted reactor       cores; leaks from the water recycling system; contaminated water       that had seeped down to groundwater which then seeped out to the       ocean; and so on (5). If this process is ongoing it would easily       explain why levels of radiation detected in fish species are not       decreasing.       </p>
<p>In April of 2012, Tepco claimed that groundwater was seeping from       below, upwards into the reactor buildings, becoming contaminated       and then seeping back out again. They had plans to use wells in       order to direct 1,000 tons of groundwater per day out to the       Pacific Ocean so that the water would not become contaminated from       the reactors. I have not confirmed whether this operation was ever       begun or its progress (6).       </p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>Nuclear expert, Arnie Gundersen, believes there is no doubt that       Fukushima is continuing to “ooze” radiation into the ocean from       water that is used to cool the melted cores, and it is leaking       from the basements of the reactor buildings (7). Previously       Gundersen stated that “Unit 3 is contaminating Unit 4. They are       connected. So we are finding water from Unit 3 leaking into Unit 4       and you know if its leaking between the buildings it’s leaking       into the ground next to the buildings too” (8). This water is       highly radioactive, measuring approximately a million becquerels       per liter. If this is leaking into the ground, it is seeping into       the ground water, and then flowing into the ocean. This is not       low-level radiation.       </p>

<p>Radioactive cesium levels in most kinds of fish caught off the       coast of Fukushima haven’t declined in the year following Japan’s       nuclear disaster, a signal that the seafloor or leakage from the       damaged reactors must be continuing to contaminate the waters –       possibly threatening fisheries for decades….Japanese government       data shows that 40 percent of bottom-dwelling fish such as cod,       flounder and halibut are above the limit (9). </p>

<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>The safety of fish and other foods from around Fukushima remains       a concern among ordinary Japanese, among the world’s highest per       capita consumers of seafood…. two greenlings, which are       bottom-feeders, had cesium levels of more than 25,000 becquerels       per kilogram, 250 times the level the government considers       safe…. Hideo Yamazaki, a marine biologist at Kinki University,       agrees with Buesseler’s theory that the cesium is leaking from the       Fukushima nuclear plant… (10).       </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nevertheless, according to Buesseler:       </p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>The ‘vast majority’ of fish caught off Japan show no sign of       radioactive contamination at levels dangerous to humans…. But       close to the plant, an ongoing high level of the reactor       byproducts cesium-134 and cesium-137 ‘implies that cesium is still       being released to the food chain’…. levels between 1,000 and       10,000 Bq/kg have been found in fish caught off Fukushima (11).       </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The new website Simply Info has done an excellent job analyzing       ongoing trends at the Fukushima disaster site. They note that as       far away as the US West Coast:       </p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>[a] group of researchers from the Oregon Sea Grant released some       of their findings on Pacific albacore tuna. The research group       found very small levels of contamination that can be traced back       to Fukushima Daiichi…. The albacore tested after Fukushima had       340 – 1024 millibequerels/kg of combined cesium. Millibequerels       are a fraction of a bequerel so these findings in the albacore are       very small. Fukushima contamination was also not found in all       albacore tested, some tested with no Fukushima related       contamination…. The albacore news is good and bad. Good that the       levels found are so low, bad in that there are still traces being       found in fish landed off the US coast (12).       </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, tuna, being at the top of the aquatic food chain, have       long been contaminated from heavy metals such as mercury, the       effluent of industrial processes. In the US, tuna consumers are       exposed to higher amounts of toxic mercury compared to Europe       where restrictions are tighter (13).       </p>
<p><b>Human Health Impact       </b></p>
<p>Simply Info makes the point about the arbitrary “safety limits”       for radiation set by authorities, noting that it is “emphasized       that levels are low and eating one of these fish would not be       lethal. Researchers seem very concerned about inadvertently       setting off panic…. The problem comes in when you look at what       someone eats in total every day. The single item consumed once may       pose limited or no risk but people eat many things. Most people       eat at least 3 times a day. If everything you consume has some       small amount of contamination it can begin to total a detectable       level in the body…. It generally isn’t the single food item that       is of concern but the total of all of a person’s food consumption       that can begin to be a concern” (Op. cit.).       </p>
<p>Establishment sources for information, bought off or bullied by       the International Nuclear Criminal Cabal (INCC), exclude a number       of concerns regarding low level radiation. They ignore models for       protecting public safety such as employing the precautionary       principle (14). Even the World Health       <br />
Organization– a United Nations body whose hands have been tied by       agreements with the International Atomic Energy Agency to keep       quiet about nuke dangers–historically admitted that “[t]here is       no safe low level of radiation” (15). Credit goes to       Director-General Margaret Chan for finally speaking out.       </p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/stepoutsidethebox.html" style="float: right;margin-left: 1em;margin-bottom: 0em"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-kADbI3spO2M/TwILKt_It9I/AAAAAAAANvU/F0N-dw_gGR4/s261/cancer.png" alt=""></a>In recent times both medical doctors and scientists have estimated       that the Fukushima nuclear disaster will cost lives. Dr. Bradford       Weeks, MD, stated that “[t]here’s some government studies, which       are always underestimated, that there would be 225,000 cases of       cancer from [Fukushima]” (16). Another fully credentialed       scientist warns that “there are going to be at least tens of       thousands and possibly hundreds of thousand or more of people in       the future dying of cancer or having children with birth defects,       but that once again is all hidden from view” (17).       </p>
<p><b>A Whole Lotta Trouble In The Bubbles       </b></p>
<p>Is Tepco getting a handle on this seemingly insurmountable       problem? After all, Humanity put a Man on the Moon, didn’t they?       </p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>To stop water from seeping out of the plant, Tokyo Electric is       building a 2,400-foot-long wall between the site’s reactors and       the ocean. But [Yoshikazu Nagai, a spokesman for Tepco] said the       steel-and-concrete wall, which will reach 100 feet underground,       will take until mid-2014 to build (“Fish Off Japan’s Coast,” Op.       cit.).       </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although such a wall might block contaminated water from reaching       the ocean, something would still have to be done with the water       itself by pumping it through filters and into containers.       </p>
<p>The main problem facing Tepco is how to clean and store       radioactive water that has been used to cool the melted reactor       cores, as the amount accumulates with no end in sight. Either a       final resting place for unimaginably huge amounts of water will       have to be found, or a means for cleansing the water so that it       can be safely discharged into the ocean will have to be invented.       Even then, the filters will have accumulated radiation and will       have to be stored in the same way that massive amounts of highly       radioactive waste is stored.       </p>
<p>In the current situation Tepco “is struggling to find space to       store tens of thousands of tons of highly contaminated water used       to cool the broken reactors. About 200,000 tons of radioactive       water — enough to fill more than 50 Olympic-sized swimming pools       — are being stored in hundreds of gigantic tanks built around the       Fukushima Dai-ichi plant…. TEPCO is close to running a new       treatment system that could make the water safe enough to release       into the ocean. Outside experts worry that if contaminated water       is released, there will be lasting impact on the environment”       (18).       </p>
<p>Figuring out how to jettison the water may be a priority, given       that land, time and space are limited.       </p>
<p>Tepco hopes to use “new purifying equipment…that is supposedly       able to decontaminate the water by removing strontium and other       nuclides, potentially below detectable levels…. Nuclear engineer       and college lecturer Masashi Goto said the contaminated water       buildup poses a long-term health and environmental threat. He       worries that the radioactive water in the basements may already be       getting into the underground water system, where it could reach       far beyond the plant, possibly the ocean or public water supplies.       ‘You never know where it’s leaking out and once it’s out you can       never put it back in place…It’s just outrageous and shows how       big a disaster the accident is.’”</p>
<p>Goto believes cleaning up the       mess will take more than a decade and that “TEPCO’s roadmap for       dealing with the problem is ‘wishful thinking…The longer it       takes, the more contaminated water they get’” (19). Already 89.2%       of water tanks are full and by 2015 even with expanded numbers of       storage tanks, they will be full again (20).       </p>
<p>Another scheme is to build a huge underground water storage pit.       One veteran engineer has criticized the scheme:       </p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>Tepco has dug a pit and lined [it] with bentonite and       polyethylene seal, and stored water underground, and then       cover[ed]. But if there were any earthquake again here, a crack       would generate, I guess. And I don’t know why Tepco has decided to       make underground [inaudible] for excess water. It can easily be       discharged into the underground water [in case of a large       earthquake] (21). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such storage methods are temporary at best       (22).       </p>
<p>As if Tepco didn’t have its hands full, there is disturbing       information from former Prime Minister Naoto Kan that contradicts       Tepco’s previously glib statements about the safety of Unit 4.       Unit 4 is the reactor building holding tons of highly radioactive       fuel rods in its pool on the fourth floor of the building. One of       Kan’s engineers has confirmed that since the earthquake the ground       underneath Unit 4 has sunk 80 centimeters in an uneven manner.       That means the building is gradually tilting and adding to worries       of building collapse, either due to ongoing structural stress, or       in the case of another major earthquake (23).       </p>

<p>We have heard about proposed solutions such as entombing the       destroyed reactors in concrete (“Arnold Gundersen with another,”       Op. cit.) or pouring borax into the melted cores, which is       supposed to neutralize radioactivity (24). I have no idea whether       these ideas would work — maybe a combination of approaches would       be the solution. A gathering of the world’s most creative-minded       scientists and engineers would be a welcome development, and long       overdue, considering that Fukushima could continue to irradiate       the Pacific Ocean for decades, if not for a long time to come. The       pathetic response so far is clear evidence of what can only be       called a psychotic dysfunction in the international scientific and       policy communities.       </p>
<p>When I browse the daily news via the Internet it is obvious that       the pace of acceleration of entropic social phenomena is       hastening, so that the convergence of technological and economic       chaos is caught in a positive feedback loop. One mishap causes       another until the dike breaks and the streets are flooded with       seawater.       </p>
<p>Maybe it is that we have built our technological society on a       series of lies, one conveniently and stealthily laid upon another,       done so subtly and imperceptibly and over such long periods of       time that no one seems to notice. We forgive ourselves for being       willing participants. We exist in a system that teaches that       resistance is futile and that immoral behavior is normal. Lasha       Darkmoon accurately summarizes the situation in Amerika in her       essay: “Here Comes Evil”:       </p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>It’s only a matter of time before the masses are shaken from       their slumber and realize that the world that awaits them is a       world under the dominion of evil. Our government is now controlled       by a criminal cabal. Our country is a loony bin where the crazies       are in charge. Our cities are crime factories. Our banks are run       by bandits who steal from the poor. Our schools are production       lines for the manufacture of morons. Our places of work are venues       of legalized exploitation and servitude. Our news is horror       fiction. Our courts are coin-operated machines that crank out       injustice. Our laws are dirty jokes. Our heroes are villains. Our       celebrities are abominations. Our politicians are psychopaths at       large. We live in an America where torture has now been normalized       and murder is legal—an Orwellian world too terrifying even for       Orwell’s imagination (25).       </p>

<p>The breakdown of technocratic systems coincides with social       disintegration. During the mid 19th century, French historian,       Alexis de Tocqueville, wrote,       </p>

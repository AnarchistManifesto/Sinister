<p><i>Knowing that there are technologies that enable a person’s thoughts to be disrupted at a distance, should we be taking a closer look at this phenomenon?</i></p>
<p>Julie Beal<br />
<a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2013/08/seventh-news-reporter-talking-gibberish.html"><b>Activist Post</b></a></p>
<p>In 2011, the Daily Mail (in the UK) published an article, asking “Are secret U.S. army tests to blame for TV presenters speaking utter gibberish?”, and described the incidents as “a string of American and Canadian TV presenters dissolving on-air into unintelligible gobbledygook, their distress obvious as they try but fail to stop themselves blurting out a train of disconnected words, before the producers cut to something else”.</p>
<p>Being the Daily Mail, the article dismissed the idea that microwaves had been targeted at these reporters to disrupt their speech as crazy conspiracy talk. But it was certainly newsworthy because this brief, sudden, series of “meltdowns” had happened in a very short space of time. Other researchers followed up on this: for instance, the video below highlights even more news reporters, including some that the mainstream missed.</p>
<p>[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rWmpgWHG_0?feature=player_detailpage]</p>
<p>This topic has been amply covered by other researchers in the past, but it’s worth looking at again because there have been two more incidents since then, making a total of at least seven (almost identical) cases!</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>There was one case in 2010, five cases in 2011, one in 2012, and another one this year, this time in Australia. Helen Kapalos experienced what some have called her “on-screen death” on the <a href="http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/television/helen-kapalos-suffers-unfortunate-8216onscreen-death8217-during-today-tonight-coverage/story-e6frfmyi-1226670790352">Today Tonight</a> programme, on the 26th of June.</p>

<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script></div>

<p>This latest event differs from the previous cases only in that Kapalos had no auto-cue or script, and her gibberish lasted much longer – at least 90 seconds. </p>

Knowing that it is technologically possible to disrupt a person’s speech, <a href="http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/dangerroom/files/Bioeffects_of_Selected_Non-Lethal_Weapons.pdf">from a distance</a>, and that the effects only last while the microwave or magnetic pulse is being emitted, really makes these events worth more analysis. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) can be used to make people blind, or just unable to see faces, it can interfere with the ability to perform actions, compute with numbers, and affect the ability to speak. In fact, anything a human wants to do can be stopped with TMS pulses.</p>
<p>Activist Post recently revealed <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2013/07/secret-darpa-mind-control-project.html">a study by DARPA/Arizona State University</a> where TMS is used to disrupt the way a person processes a story. Some people have speculated that the newsreaders were somehow targeted through their earpieces, but a new technology, called capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers can deliver <a href="http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2010-09/darpa-wants-mind-control-keep-soldiers-sharp-smart-and-safe">transcranial pulsed ultrasound</a> to a person’s brain remotely, reaching deeper into the cortex.</p>
<p>This technology is also being developed at Arizona State University, with funding from DARPA, using <a href="http://science.dodlive.mil/2010/09/01/remote-control-of-brain-activity-using-ultrasound/">ultrasonic neuromodulation</a> to affect changes in the state of the brain.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/infinite-brain.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_qLAIskTQXUc/TdSeGgTQjyI/AAAAAAAAI3g/uIBlfFK1IqU/Todd-250x250-01A.gif"></a>Most of the reporters have, after the event, been told the problem was due to either epilepsy, stroke, or migraine. However, it is incredibly improbable that they could have maintained their composure, with no signs of discomfort, pain, twitching, instability, or any of the other symptoms that accompany these illnesses. All of them appear confused about what’s coming out of their mouths, as if they can’t quite tell if they are making sense or not, but all of them keep talking then go straight back to normal afterwards, as though someone just turned the switch off. Not only that, but speaking gibberish (and that’s all) is a symptom not usually exhibited by someone with a migraine, or someone having a stroke or an epileptic fit. They can – but most don’t. And when they do, it usually lasts at least several minutes, not mere seconds. </p>
<p>Add to this the fact that there are millions of live recordings on file, and there are no other reported instances of this happening before. Just these seven, and five of them happened in 2011 alone – all to news reporters!</p>
<p>Ian Punnett (10 July, 2010) was unable to explain what happened to him during his usual radio chat with Coast to Coast A.M.’s George Noory:</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>As Mr. Punnett put it, he had and has no real idea what happened to cause that. A Christian minister, Punnett neither drinks nor takes drugs. What he remembers is sitting in his home office waiting to do that routine promo phone call for the following night’s Coast to Coast A.M. show, then taking the call from the radio producer and waited on the line until George Noory came on. He remembered the beginning of the conversation, then suddenly his recollection stopped and all he knew is that Mr. Noory cut him off when he didn’t feel he was finished promo-ing the upcoming show, something he felt was a little rude as he couldn’t understand why he was cut short. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>Mr. Punnett explained that the station producer called him back and asked him what was wrong but that he was unaware of any problem. He then went on to work in his office, fully awake and coherent, for another hour and a half before going to bed. (<a href="http://voices.yahoo.com/ian-punett-was-coast-coast-ams-weekend-host-drunk-6389526.html">Source</a>)</p>

<p>The next event was just a few months later; Sarah Carlson (18 JANUARY 2011) was speaking perfectly on WISC-TV in Wisconsin when she suddenly lapsed into utter gibberish. This episode only lasted ten seconds. Carlson had previously had an epileptic seizure on air; she was sitting next to her co-host but not on camera, and viewers <a href="http://host.madison.com/news/local/article_bdf86e88-da1f-11de-8bce-001cc4c03286.html">reported hearing a noise</a>, then seeing her slump into his arms.</p>
<p>[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTKx3orfZ8A?feature=player_detailpage]</p>
<p>Serene Branson was the next to speak gibberish, just one month later, while she was reporting from the Grammy music awards;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgELlF6_e8w"> the video went viral</a>, despite also lasting only a few seconds. Following the episode, Branson was examined by paramedics, and found to be fine: a colleague gave her a ride back home, as “a precautionary measure”, and the next morning she felt fine. <a href="http://www.popeater.com/2011/02/14/serene-branson-stroke/">(Source)</a></p>
<p>Her doctor told her it was a <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2011/feb/17/news/la-heb-branson-episode-20110217">complex migraine</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>Serene Branson…..  described being ‘terrified and confused’ ….. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>She said later: ‘My head was definitely pounding and I was very uncomfortable, and I knew something wasn’t right.’ Her doctor later said she had suffered a complex migraine, the symptoms of which mimic a stroke. <a href="http://www.sott.net/article/226667-The-Mystery-of-the-TV-Presenters-Who-Suddenly-Started-Talking-Gibberish">(Source)</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following month, it was Mark McAllister’s turn.  The <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox9oUVDxnOE">video of this event</a> once again shows the reporter speaking normally, then suddenly switch to gibberish. This time, it lasted for forty seconds, and like the others, he went from normal to gibberish and then back to normal.</p>
<p>He was trying to speak about U.S. military action in Libya when he said,</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>‘More than sifty four 18 fighter jets are spending about as much as 20 and about ready to assist 600 hundred, hundred deployed over the an amount needed.’…..

Like the other reporters he maintained his composure, and used the correct intonation, and even hand gestures, for someone reporting the news. The speech problems associated with migraines, epilepsy and strokes are generally referred to as slurring of speech, and an inability to form words correctly. These reporters, however, spoke quickly and appeared normal. Most of the time, they did not sound like they were struggling to speak at all. They were merely confused about what was happening, though apparently unaware that they were making no sense, as they all kept trying to keep going.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7lCcc-pwi0">Annie Stensrud</a> (December 2011) began by speaking almost normally, and her speech was a bit slow and slurred, which led many people to accuse her of being drunk at the time. However, after nearly two minutes of this, Stensrud makes no sense at all at the end of her episode, then all of a sudden she was back to normal. (<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2162021/Dave-Barnett-Bizarre-air-rambling-TV-sports-announcer-leaves-viewers-baffled.html">Source</a>)</p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>Stensrud thinks the anti-anxiety medication she was taking had caused this to happen, and insisted she was neither drunk, nor a drunkard, at the time, but turned to drink after her life was destroyed by all the bitching. Not long after, she was pulled over and prosecuted for drunk driving, and subsequently got fired from her job as a TV news anchor and had been unable to find work since when interviewed a year later. In other words, it ruined her life. <a href="http://blogs.citypages.com/blotter/2012/08/annie_stensrud_drunk_broadcast_anchor_says_she_wasnt_drunk.php">(Source)</a></p>

<p>Texas Rangers television broadcaster, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5acEeLJS-0">Dave Barnett</a>, began talking nonsense live and on-air 18 June 2012, whilst commentating on a soccer game, saying, for instance, “Go ahead run… is at fifth on what Adams is insisting on calling it a botched robbery. But what actually happened was his henchmen took piece literally out of…” He was then cut off momentarily, and then he carried on normally, as though nothing had happened. <a href="http://blogs.dallasobserver.com/unfairpark/2012/06/rangers_broadcaster_dave_barne.php">(Source)</a> He was later diagnosed as having suffered a migraine. (<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2162021/Dave-Barnett-Bizarre-air-rambling-TV-sports-announcer-leaves-viewers-baffled.html">Source</a>)</p>
<p>There is one other case, which sounds very similar – Judith Sheindlin, known in the U.S. as Judge Judy, suddenly lapsed into <a href="http://www.thespec.com/news-story/2198895-babbling-judge-judy-hospitalized-/">speaking gibberish</a> while recording a show (March, 2011). She was taken to hospital for tests, but was found to be well. Doctors have suggested she may have had a transient ischemic attack (TIA), though <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz_Z3TBoBoM">the normal symptoms for a TIA</a> are dizziness, and weakness on one side of the body, such as a droopy eye, though no such symptoms were said to have been experienced by Sheindlin, who afterwards commented, “Turned out to be I was fine, I’m not sure whether I had one of those TIA experiences and they go away”. (<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1383489/Judge-Judy-speaks-mini-stroke-I-talking-slow-motion.html">Source</a>)</p>
<p>(There is no video footage of Judge Judy, so it is not possible to assess what happened to her.)</p>
<p>So just how likely is it that all of these incidents can be explained by epilepsy, stroke, or migraine? (Only happening to news reporters?!) Epilepsy can cause <a href="http://www.healingwell.com/community/default.aspx?f=23&amp;m=139635">‘speech arrest’</a> but this is quite a <a href="http://www.news-medical.net/news/20130813/Patients-with-rare-epilepsy-aphasia-share-mutations-on-same-gene.aspx">rare form</a> of epilepsy – as low as 1.75% of epileptics suffer from <a href="http://www.ehealthme.com/cs/epilepsy/aphasia">aphasia</a>  or <a href="http://www.ehealthme.com/cs/epilepsy/slurred+speech">slurred speech</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>When a patient has a seizure, the electrical activity in her brain is disrupted. …. The <a href="http://www.efnj.com/content/info/seizures.html">Epilepsy Foundation of New Jersey</a> states that partial seizures, also called focal seizures, are the most common seizures. When a patient has a partial seizure, the abnormal electrical activity occurs on only one hemisphere of the brain. With a simple partial seizure, the patient does not have problems with consciousness or memory. …. The other type of partial seizure, complex partial seizures, do affect memory and behavior, according to the <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000697.htm">National Institutes of Health (NIH)</a>. Symptoms include staring, not understanding what other people say, smacking lips, moving limbs in strange ways and speaking nonsense. <a href="http://www.empowher.com/epilepsy/content/nine-types-common-seizures?page=0,0">(Source)</a></p>

<p>Those who are unfortunate enough to suffer a stroke, or a mini-stroke (known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transient_ischemic_attack">transient ischemic attack or TIA</a>) may have difficulty speaking, as shown in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q68XVzzFMCY">this video on YouTube</a> (the man starts to ‘have a stroke’ at about 55 seconds, and he can’t speak at all). However, it is not at all common to have this symptom only, and retaining composure is probably unheard of when it comes to strokes, epilepsy, and migraine.</p>
<p>The Heart and Stroke Foundation shows a<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1sN0DpRrnTo&amp;list=TLpIDpsK_1EsA"> video on YouTube</a> which says typical symptoms of TIAs are muscle weakness, numbness or tingling, vision problems, droopy face, dizziness, slurring your words, or difficulty expressing your thoughts, and typically last between 30 seconds and ten minutes. Epilepsy is usually accompanied by seizures, and migraines make a person’s face crumple in pain. People with migraines do not need to be told they have had one – they know all too well what it feels like.</p>

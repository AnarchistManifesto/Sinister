<p>Jack Blood, <i>Contributing Writer</i><br />
<a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2011/06/kkr-to-buy-top-isp-domain-reg-go-daddy.html"><b>Activist Post</b></a></p>
<p>If you haven’t heard much about <a href="http://www.kkr.com/">KKR</a>  (Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts and Co) it’s probably not your fault. Like  many Pac Man style private equity groups gobbling up vast proportions of  businesses in every sector, they tend to be “publicity shy” and like  to operate in the dark of night, with a cloak of anonymity.</p>
<p>In  other words, since they and other P.E.’s  own much of the media designed  to inform us of these matters, it’s not hard to keep things on the QT.</p>
<p>Private Equity basically means that since they have no stockholders to answer to, (<i>except within the compartmentalization of the various individual companies they leverage</i>) they  do not have to justify acquisitions and mergers . . . which simply get  announced in the back pages of newspapers. (They can also classify just  who is investing in the myriad companies under their control!)</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both;text-align: center"><a href="https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/350px-Private_Equity_Fund_Diagram1.png" style="clear: left;float: left;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-right: 1em"><img border="0" height="200" src="https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/350px-Private_Equity_Fund_Diagram.png" width="320"></a></div>
<p>According to an updated 2008 ranking created by industry magazine Private Equity International (The PEI 50), the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_private_equity_firms" title="List of private equity firms">largest private equity firms</a> include <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlyle_Group" title="Carlyle Group">The Carlyle Group</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kohlberg_Kravis_Roberts" title="Kohlberg Kravis Roberts">Kohlberg Kravis Roberts</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs" title="Goldman Sachs">Goldman Sachs Principal Investment Group</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackstone_Group" title="Blackstone Group">The Blackstone Group</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bain_Capital" title="Bain Capital">Bain Capital</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPG_Capital" title="TPG Capital">TPG Capital</a>.  These firms are typically direct investors in companies rather than  investors in the private equity asset class and, for the most part, the  largest private equity investment firms focused primarily on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leveraged_buyout" title="Leveraged buyout">leveraged buyouts</a> rather than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venture_capital" title="Venture capital">venture capital</a>.</p>
<p><b>(Thomas Lee Partners should definitely be mentioned here, and it is rather suspicious that they have been “omitted”)</b></p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preqin" title="Preqin">Preqin</a> ltd (formerly known as Private Equity Intelligence), an independent data providers provides a ranking of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fund_of_funds#Private_equity_fund_of_funds" title="Fund of funds">25 largest private equity investment managers</a>. Among the largest firms in that ranking were <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlpInvest_Partners" title="AlpInvest Partners">AlpInvest Partners</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AXA_Private_Equity" title="AXA Private Equity">AXA Private Equity</a>, <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIG" title="AIG">AIG Investments</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs" title="Goldman Sachs">Goldman Sachs Private Equity Group</a></b> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantheon_Ventures" title="Pantheon Ventures">Pantheon Ventures</a>.</p>
<p>Yeah  – you got it: the “equity” they raise (at least in the case of AIG and  Goldman Sachs) came out of your pockets through things like T.A.R.P and  QE1,QE2, 3, 4, 5….. Thanks to the “Federal” Reserve.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>In  many circumstances these behemouths work together to pool their  combined resources in joint ventures. The Bain Capitol Partners / Thomas  Lee <a href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:Grdq-IS7u3EJ:www.clearchannel.com/Corporate/PressRelease.aspx%3FPressReleaseID%3D1824+KKR+Bain+clearchannel&amp;cd=2&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;source=www.google.com">buyout of Clearchannel</a> is just one example.</p>
<div style="float: left;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-right: 1em">

<p>
The  standard operating procedure for P.E. Co’s appears to be one of using  connections and influence to drive down the price of said targeted  company for takeover, then use those same connections to grow the  business to astronomical proportions.  At this time it is either sold for  profit, or used for more leverage.</p>
<p>These Private Equity firms  also work together so they do not have to bid against each other, and  this of course keeps prices down and eliminates competition. The charges  of bid rigging are many.</p>
<p><i>Here is but one story of  the above mention collusion:</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.law.com/jsp/cc/PubArticleCC.jsp?id=1202427246563"><i><b>Price Fixing Suit involves Prominent Private equity Players</b></i></a> </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><b><i>Action alleges banks, private equity firms kept company prices low</i> </b></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Lawyers  for the private equity industry are watching a consolidated antitrust  class action alleging that 17 private equity companies and investment  banks conspired to keep the price of target companies artificially low  during a five-year period. The case recently survived a motion to  dismiss, exposing to trial companies such as JPMorgan Chase and Merrill  Lynch. The suit names some of the most prominent private equity and  public investment players, including Bain Capital Partners and The  Blackstone Group.</i> </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><i>The suit names some of the most prominent private equity and public investment players, including <b>Bain Capital Partners</b>, The Blackstone Group, <b>Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co</b>. and Thomas H. Lee Partners L.P.</i> </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Eleven companies or their defense attorneys declined comment: Blackstone; <b>the Carlyle Group</b>  and a couple of its funds; Goldman Sachs; JPMorgan; Merrill Lynch;  Providence Equity Partners Inc.; Silver Lake Partners; Texas Pacific  Group; Thomas H. Lee; and Warburg Pincus. Others did not respond to a  request for comment, including Apollo Global Management, <b>Kohlberg Kravis</b> and Permira Advisors.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most  informed Americans know something about the Carlyle Group. Famous  during the Bush Presidency (Both George Bush’s, Bin Ladens, Queen Liz <a href="http://www.tvnewslies.org/html/kept_promises.html">among others</a>…. <a href="http://whatreallyhappened.com/WRHARTICLES/bush_family_911.html">were beneficiaries of 911 and the war on terror!</a> What is rarely mentioned by Democrats these days is just how prominent Carlyle still is today in the Obama Admin!</p>
<p>So, here’s a question for ya: WHO DID COUSIN OBAMA APPOINT TO HEAD GM AFTER IT WAS “NATIONALIZED” er…. BAILED OUT?</p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p><b>Now…. All you Bush haters, and Obama Lovers….. PUT THAT IN YOUR PIPE AND SMOKE IT</b>. While you’re at it go get some Dunkin’ Donuts because Carlyle owns that too! (<i>sigh</i>)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.baincapital.com/">Bain Capital</a> Partners might be of interest these days if for no other reason than the fact that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bain_Capital">Mitt Romney is a principle founder</a>.  Maybe THAT is why Romney is considered by the “Media” to be a front  runner for the GOP Nomination for President of the USA! Starting off  with Office Supply giant “Staples” – Bain has, in the matter of just a  decade or so,  shot to the top of the list of P.E. Firms!<br />
And this can get really sneaky as we will see below. Bain owns Staples, Staples owns Whole Foods, etc….</p>
<p><b>So – Getting back to our premise, WHO IS KKR? </b></p>

<p>Here is just a small snapshot of companies owned or operated by KKR. We only list the ones you will be most familiar with. <b>(We suggest boycotting these companies if you love Freedom!!!)</b></p>
<p><b>BMG Music:</b>  (buys, or steals copyrights to popular music catalogs) – They have also  ruined many a music career through careless and targeted shelving – I  call this the “Illuminati Distribution Cartel” – They all mostly work  together to allow certain music to be distributed to the public, while  gate-keeping those who might contribute to a more “Aware” society. My  Friends <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHTFeJD6Upc">Gwen Mars</a> were victims of BMG.</p>
<p><b>Del Monte Foods Co</b>:  Described as: One of the country’s largest producers, distributors and  marketers of premium-quality, branded pet and food products for the U.S.  retail market.  U.S. retail market, generating approximately $3.7  billion in net sales in fiscal 2010. They claim to be Nutritionally  conscious, but a quick look into the matter shows that they are one of  the largest distributors of GMO Foods for people and pets. Del Monte  could be considered a major component of the “Illuminati Food  Distribution Cartel”.</p>
<p><b>Dollar General Corp:</b> A  customer-driven distributor of everyday items, including basic  consumable merchandise and other home, apparel and seasonal products,  with more than 8,000 stores in 35 states.  (<i>As of February, 2010) </i></p>
<p>This Company is cornering the market in the “Dollar Store” arena, which targets the nation’s poor (<i>which grows in proportion with every passing day!</i>).<b> </b></p>
<p><b>Eastman Kodak: </b><i>(bought cheap!) </i>A diversified group with a broad range of activities principally across  film, photography, commercial printing and consumer electronics.</p>
<p><b>Energy Future Holding Corp:</b>  Manages a portfolio of competitive and regulated energy subsidiaries  consisting of TXU Energy, a competitive electricity retailer, Luminant, a  competitive power generation business, including mining, wholesale  marketing and trading, and construction, and Oncor, a regulated electric  distribution and transmission business. <b>The Chairman is Don Evans</b>.  The Insider of insiders…. Appointed U.S. secretary of commerce by  President George W. Bush. He is also a Senior Partner at Quintana <b>Energy</b> Partners, L.P. (“conflict of interest” is a term that comes to mind.)</p>
<p>Remember VP Dick Cheney’s <a href="http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Cheney_Energy_Task_Force">secret energy meetings before 911</a>? Don was at a minimum a peripheral  player.</p>
<p>On the Board of Directors of EFH is Thomas D. Ferguson who also is a managing director of Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co.  (<b>See how this works?</b>)  Also on the board is Scott Lebovitz, yet another managing director of  Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co – Jeffrey Liaw (BoD)  Mr. Liaw once worked for  Bain Capital (those guys again) -Also on the board is:  Marc S.  Lipschultz (Goldman Sachs),  Lyndon L. Olson, Jr<b>.:</b>  Olson was a senior adviser with Citigroup Inc. (Rockefeller) from 2002  to 2008, after serving as United States ambassador to Sweden from 1998  to 2001. (He is also chairman of the board of the Texas Scottish Rite  Hospital in Dallas) – Kenneth Pontarelli is a managing director of  Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. in its principal investment. </p>

William K. Reilly – This guy is one of the most powerful people you  may have never heard about! He is the MAN if you want to know who is <a href="http://www.pwc.com/lu/en/sustainability/docs/pwc-pe.pdf">driving</a> the <a href="http://www.truthwinds.com/siterun_data/government/new_world_order/news.php?q=1289321921">Agenda 21</a> car in the USA. (This is a massive scam to convince the public that these <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-04-06/kkr-barbarians-go-green-as-buyout-firms-embrace-more-profit-in-less-energy.html">“barbarians” are all going green</a>.  Really they have just found a nicer way to kill you after sucking you  dry!) He works directly for NWO Chief Prince Philip – Queen Liz’s hubby,  who <a href="http://american_almanac.tripod.com/tinny.htm">once stated</a>  that “he would like to be reincarnated as a deadly disease to kill off  80% of the global population”! Nice huh?) Accolades: Administrator of  the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (1989-1993), president of the  World Wildlife Fund (1985-1989), president of The Conservation  Foundation (1973-1989), and <b>director of the Rockefeller Task Force on Land Use and Urban Growth</b>  from (1972-1973).

He holds a B.A. degree from Yale, J.D. from Harvard and M.S. in Urban  Planning from Columbia University. (all three ranking as the top NWO  training centers)</p>
<p>Jonathan D. Smidt: Like many in KKR he was  involved in KINDERCARE a cesspool of Ritual Luciferian abuse on  children! Prior to joining KKR, Mr. Smidt was at Goldman Sachs &amp; Co<br />
*Most every board member of this colossal energy company (and that of the KKR “capstone”) has ties to <a href="http://finance.fortune.cnn.com/2010/10/21/breaking-kkr-buying-goldman/">Goldman Sachs</a>, The CFR, UT, Stanford U (<a href="http://educate-yourself.org/nwo/nwotavistockbestkeptsecret.shtml">Tavistock</a>)  Harvard, and James Baker (Carlyle Group) Bush Crime Family Capo…  Together they represent a whos who of the energy industrial complex,  merging into banking, education, and healthcare.</p>
<p>*<b>I cannot  – for the sake of time – do such an extensive diagnostic of each KKR  holding… But the pattern continues in each company. This, I believe,  makes it easier for a small group of people to own and control  EVERYTHING! </b><i>(To see ALL of KKR’s holdings  <a href="http://www.kkr.com/kpe/private_equity_portfolio.cfm">go to the KKR website</a>.)</i><b><br />

<p>I<i>n 1948, when Prescott was looking for a job in the oil industry for his </i><i>son, the future US President, George Bush, he turned to his great friend,</i><i> Ray <b>Kravis</b>, the father of <b>Henry</b> <b>Kravis</b>, the very same man who today owns</i><i><b> Kindercare</b> through his company, Kohlburg, <b>Kravis</b>, and Roberts. Father Ray</i><i> was the son of a British tailor who made a fortune through the oil industry.</i> </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><i>His specialty was tax accountancy and he invented a tax shelter which </i><i>reduced tax liability for oil companies by as much as 65%. He was very </i><i>popular with the classic Illuminati families and offered George Bush a job,</i><i> although he later chose to work elsewhere.</i> </p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>“I know George Bush well,” Ray <b>Kravis</b> said later. “I’ve known him since he</i><i> got out of school. His father was a very good friend of mine.”</i> </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Ray <b>Kravis</b> also became closely associated with the Kennedy family and the</i><i> mega-crook, Joseph Kennedy, the Illuminati father of JFK, made him manager </i><i>of the family fortune. <b>Kravis</b> and Joe Kennedy were often golf partners </i><i>during their winters in Palm Beach. </i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Webster Tarpley and Anton Chaitkin, in their outstanding book, George Bush, the Unauthorised Biography<i>, said:</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i> That the</i><i> business techniques of father Ray were passed onto his son, <b>Henry</b>, the owner </i><i>of <b>Kindercare</b>. They write:</i> </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><i>“Such activity imparted the kind of primitive-accumulation mentality that</i><i> was later seen to animate Ray Kravis’s son <b>Henry</b>. During the 1980s, as we</i><i> will see, <b>Henry</b> <b>Kravis</b> personally generated some $58 billion in debt for the </i><i>purpose of acquiring 36 companies and assembling the largest corporate empire</i><i>, in paper terms, of all time. <b>Henry</b> <b>Kravis</b> would be one of the leaders</i><i> of the leveraged buyout gang which became a mainstay of the political machine of George Bush”.</i> </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><i>During the Reagan-Bush and Bush-Quayle administrations, Kohlburg, <b>Kravis</b>, and Roberts (KKR), founded in 1976, compiled a fantastic empire through often</i><i> forced takeovers of companies using apparently limitless borrowed </i><i>money.  Actor Michael Douglas was the former prep school classmate of <b>Henry</b></i><i><b> Kravis</b>, and <b>it was <a href="http://www.makingsteel.com/nuts-bolts.html">his character that inspired Douglas’s portrayal </a>of Gordon</b></i><i><b> Gekko</b>, the corporate raider in the Oliver Stone movie, Wall Street.</i></p>

<p>An announcement of the sale could come as early as next  week, although a deal hasn’t been signed yet and the people cautioned  that an agreement may not be reached. (<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article">source</a>)</p>
<p><b>Go Daddy</b> is an Internet <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name_registrar" title="Domain name registrar">domain registrar</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_hosting" title="Web hosting">Web hosting</a> company that also sells e-business related <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software" title="Software">software</a> and services. <b>In 2010, it reached more than 45 million <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name" title="Domain name">domain names</a> under management</b>.

<b>Bob (Robert) Parsons</b> is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer" title="Chief executive officer">CEO</a> and founder of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Go_Daddy_Group,_Inc." title="The Go Daddy Group, Inc.">The Go Daddy Group, Inc.</a>, a family of companies comprising three ICANN-accredited domain name registrars, including flagship registrar <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GoDaddy.com" title="GoDaddy.com">GoDaddy.com</a>, reseller registrar Wild West Domains and Blue Razor Domains.

<p>Right  now KKR and partners are busy doing all they can to shut out any other  potential buyers, while painting Bob Parsons to be an unstable nut bag  in an attempt to drive down confidence, and therefore the price. <b>It is in every sense PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE!</b></p>
<p>If  these pac-maniac vampires get a hold of Go Daddy, they will have  effectively taken control of a huge section of the Internet. If needed,  they can shut down or “accidentally” delete websites, cancel domains, or  tamper with sites unfriendly to their friends.</p>
<p>Of course when the inevitable “<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/24/business/worldbusiness/24iht-cyber.1.6299676.html">E Pearl Harbor</a>” hits the web, KKR and friends will be the first to sign on to the already prepared “<a href="http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/258311">E Patriot Act</a>“.

<div class="separator" style="clear: both;text-align: center"><a href="https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/topimg_1972_godaddy_logo_600x4001.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em;margin-right: 1em"></a></div>
<p>The corporate conflation existing in these Private Equity companies  makes it harder for the average citizen to know who owns what. On thing  we have learned over the years is by cross referencing the Board of  Directors in any of the various holdings, we can get a pretty good  glimpse of the fascist leaning of “Cartel Capitalism” (which cannot, and  should not EVER be confused with Free Market Principles of someone like  myself, or Ron Paul for that matter.)</p>
<p>Back in 2002 with the help of a researcher than has long since  “disappeared” … I stumbled on a company (WFE) that claimed to own almost  everything in every sector of life:  Education, Finance, Health,  Technology, Media, Arts and music . . . you name it; they had some of it. At  the time they were working with Warren Buffet and others to corner the  Silver market ( a feat too big even for them) When I began discussing  this mega company that no one had ever heard of, and exposed their  website….Guess what? It disappeared. They simply vanished.</p>
<p>(I have since determined that they changed their name and put on a tighter mask.)</p>
<p>As  early back as the 1970s we could see that the Rockefellers (for  example) owned over 50% of all Pharmaceutical companies, and the  majority of the  Airlines. Because of newer “anti trust” laws, and the  overall awareness of the public to be wary of such massive ownership in  every sector (and control of the populace as a result) – The  Industrialists have had to be a whole lot more sneaky in owning  everything at once.</p>
<p>It is my sincere goal that articles like this  help to spotlight this manipulation of markets, price fixing, and supply  of quality goods, and services for the ultimate freedom of citizens  around the world!</p>

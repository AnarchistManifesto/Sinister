<p>Over the past  30 years, <b>over 40,000 patents were created and accepted on genes alone</b>.</p>
<p>As these genes are acquired and patented, it is only a matter of time  before large corporations will own patents on a large number of human genes  and tissues.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>Companies have been <i>patenting genes for over 100 years</i>.</p>
<p>As the patents continue to be created, so does the potential for a  large amount of the human genetic coding to be owned by major  corporations.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, these companies simply copy and  alter human genes and subsequently claim ownership.</p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

According to the  government, these <b>gene patents are intellectual property to the companies who have created them</b>. If in the future these patented genes are utilized in the creation of <a href="http://naturalsociety.com/genetic-hybrid-human-animal-experiments-lead-to-call-for-new-rules/">experimental animals or controversial hybrids</a>, companies will essentially own a portion of the living creature itself.</p>
<p>Many  people are worried about what this means for the future of mankind,  long term and short term. This kind of practice is much more intrusive  than influential on the human race. No one truly knows just how  impactful gene patents will be on the population, or even how the  possibility of negative outcomes can be properly dealt with.</p>
<p>Certainly not everyone supports the genetic modification of human food, <i>let alone on the human race</i>. We have already seen how <b><a href="http://naturalsociety.com/how-biotech-corporations-and-gmo-crops-are-threatening-the-environment-and-humankind-alike/">genetic modification of the food supply can pose health hazards</a></b>. In fact, <a href="http://naturalsociety.com/genetically-modified-foods/" title="GMO">GMO</a>’s are seeing such opposition that <b><a href="http://naturalsociety.com/gmo-crops-continually-banned-around-world-health-freedom/">GMO crops are continually being banned around</a></b> the  world in display of health freedom. People don’t want to be eating  man-made genes anymore, and they certainly do not want living organisms  to be <i>made out of them</i>.</p>
<p>In a recent phone interview with Harriet Washington, author of <i>Deadly Monopolies: The Shocking Corporate Takeover of Life Itself-And the Consequences for Your Health and Our Medical Future, </i>Harriett  discusses the negative implications of corporate medical patents and  what needs to be done to stop the research profits from ruining our  health.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Brad Jacobson: The main piece of  legislation that opened the door for corporations to begin patenting  human life was the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980. Can you tell us how this law  was sold to the American people?</b></p>
<p>Harriet Washington: Just  to recap what the Bayh-Dole Act is, basically it was a law that  permitted for the first time universities to legally transfer their  patents to private corporations, to sell them, license them. That had  been virtually prohibited in the past because most of these new  inventions had been developed with tax dollars. And the thinking had  been, “If you develop things with our tax dollars, then we shouldn’t  allow them to go to private corporations who can establish a monopoly  with their patents.”</p>
<p>It was sold to the American public primarily  by [former Indiana Sen.] Birch Bayh, who of course partnered with  [former Kansas Sen.] Bob Dole. But it was Birch Bayh who made the  argument that we have all these patents lying around, no one’s doing  anything with them. If we let corporations get them, then they’ll  develop them into needed medications. So people were told this is the  root to get the medications and treatments that we need.</p>
<p>However,  what’s really interesting, though — I went behind the scenes and of  course I saw that, rather than being any kind of groundswell of popular  support, the law actually passed on the last hour of the last day of the  last congressional session because of some good ol’ boy networking.</p>
<p><b>BJ: Also in 1980, the legal counterpart for this corporate opening came with the court decision<i>Diamond v. Chakrabarty</i>,  in which a scientist’s patenting of an oil-eating bacteria was  contested. But how is this different than what had been patentable in  the past?</b> </p>
<p>HW: It’s certainly a good question because  living things have been patented in the past. That’s a misconception  people have. Louis Pasteur had patented a yeast. Takamine [Hideo] had  patented adrenaline. Numerous living things had been patented before.  However, there were often legal challenges by people who would say,  “This patent is not really valid because you can’t patent a product of  nature.” </p>
<p>So in 1980, when Ananda Chakrabarty, a researcher at  General Electric, decided to try to patent some bacteria that he had  intensively engineered to be able to “eat crude oil,” the U.S.] patent  office said, “We’ll patent the process you use, but we’re not going to  patent these bacteria. They’re living things and only inventions can be  patented. We can’t patent products of nature.” </p>
<p>So Chakrabarty and  General Electric sued and the patent office decided to defer to the  Supreme Court. The Supreme Court decided that, yes, living things can be  patented, which is interesting because Chakrabarty insisted he was  shocked by the ruling. He said that he fully expected he had made his  case, but he was surprised they decided to more broadly permit the  patenting of living things. </p>
<p>But now it’s being applied to things  where the contribution of the researcher is nowhere near so extensive.  So, of course, genetic sequences found in our body are being patented.  Medically important animals — like Harvard’s OncoMouse which is  guaranteed to get cancer — are being patented. And so these products of  nature, including products of our bodies, being patented has created  huge problems for us. </p>
<p><b>BJ: In 1951, Henrietta Lacks, an  African-American woman, was being treated for cervical cancer without  success at John Hopkins University. Without Henrietta’s or her family’s  knowledge, John Hopkins University researcher Dr. George Gey obtained a  sample of her tumor from her doctors, which eventually led to his  creation of an immortalized cell line used in the development of the  polio vaccine as well as drugs for numerous other diseases. It also  generated millions of dollars in profits around the world, yet the Lacks  family was never compensated, nor did they even have health insurance  at the time. How was this case a harbinger for what would follow in the  context of patient rights in regard to medical patents?</b> </p>
<div style="float: right;margin-left: 1em;margin-bottom: 0em"><a href="http://activistpost.net/survivalseedbank.html"><img class="noshadow" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_qLAIskTQXUc/TVxr_EnYeqI/AAAAAAAAGzo/SeV_Frv5FHg/seedbankonly.jpg" style="background:none" alt=""></a></div>
<p>
HW:  I actually met with the Lacks family in the mid-1990s. I wrote about  her case and I think there are some things that have been promulgated  that are not exactly true. It’s true the family didn’t have any health  insurance and weren’t compensated. But they never evinced concern about  being paid. I think that was a focus that had been imposed later by  people who I think had the best intentions in the world. Some of the  people who wrote about them were very concerned they weren’t paid. </p>
<p>But  the Lacks family expressed consistently that their mother had been a  medical benefactor and no one knew this. Her name had been changed in  the accounts so that nobody knew who she was. They were very upset about  the autonomy. </p>
<p>And they didn’t like having been lied to of course. </p>

<p><b>BJ:  You mention in the book the paternalistic nature that Dr. Gey had  taken. The excuse he’d used was that he changed her name to protect her,  but they didn’t really accept that.</b> </p>
<p>HW: Her husband  thought they didn’t want the world to know that this is a black lady  helping science. And that seemed to be the prevailing attitude in the  family. They resented that.</p>
<p><b>BJ: What’s the positive impact, however, of this cell line having never been patented?</b> </p>
<p>HW:  So what happened to Henrietta Lacks was an abuse of her and her family.  But the dissemination of her cells very cheaply, not free but very  cheaply, made a lot of medical advances possible. The reason they  weren’t patented was this was before 1980 and it wasn’t legally  possible. It also wasn’t part of the medical culture then. Medicine was  being practiced by people in university settings. They had different  motivations, not money. </p>
<p>Now it’s impossible to speculate about  exactly what would’ve happened. But had her cells been patentable, had  this happened after 1980, there’s a good chance that certainly  recognizing their value, Dr. Gey or John Hopkins or some other  researcher would’ve taken a patent out on it and then they would’ve, as  is usual, only licensed them to the researchers and universities that  would have paid them a hefty fee. Or perhaps not licensed them at all. </p>
<p>Which  means the polio vaccine probably would still be developed, but it  might’ve cost a lot more money than it did. It might not have been  available to everybody as it was. So those are the differences. </p>
<p><b>BJ:  John Moore, a leukemia patient in the 1980s, first had his spleen  removed in 1976. Unbeknownst to him, it would lead to the creation of a  cell line estimated to be worth $3 million by the pharmaceutical company  Sandoz. Moore sued his doctor who had removed the spleen after he  discovered the doctor had filed for a patent on his cells and proteins  that led to this lucrative cell line. Can you talk about the difference  between what happened in the case and its impact?</b> </p>
<p>HW:  When John Moore was initially treated, the Chakrabarty law had not been  decided yet. Bayh-Dole hadn’t been passed. So, as living things, his  cells weren’t eligible for patenting either. However, once these rulings  were passed, his doctor, Dr. David Golde, and the University of  California, immediately responded by taking out a patent on his cells. </p>
<p>His  doctor recognized that his spleen and his cells were medically  important. He knew that, but it was before he could take a patent out on  them. I’m sure at that point he never dreamed that in a few years he  would be able to take this collection and sample of his cells and  tissues — that he had assiduously kept alive and was researching — and  take out a patent on them and control the profits from them. </p>
<p>So  when the law was passed, Dr. Golde had already established a laboratory  to do research on it. He and another researcher and the university owned  the patent. Now they went to Sandoz and established a contract for $3  million — $3 million 1980 dollars. Then [Sandoz] could plan to acquire  huge profits. Before that, Dr. Golde had been interested for the usual  reasons. He would be able to hopefully develop some medically useful  compounds and, more to the point, become famous and get some  publications. Now, there was a great deal of money to be made.</p>
<p><b>BJ:  You write that today, however, as opposed to the case of Henrietta  Lacks and John Moore, it is normal tissues in large quantities that  provides a lot of wealth for people who hold patents. So are you saying  that everyone is now vulnerable to the same kind of appropriation as  what happened to Lacks and Moore?</b></p>
<p>HW: Yes. Lacks and  Moore’s vulnerability was a bit different, but it was the same  principle. And today, we’re all vulnerable to that. We’re vulnerable  because if we undergo surgery in certain hospitals, such as the Harvard  University hospitals or Duke and a number of others, we are given a  consent form to sign, which will give a private corporation, in many  cases Ardais [Corp.], the rights to any tissues or cells taken from our  body, often described in the consent form as “discarded and worthless.”  But they’re not worthless or the corporation wouldn’t have bought them. </p>

Also,  in many cities in this country — in fact, in more than half the states —  have something called medical examiners laws, or presumed consent law.  These laws dictate that a medical examiner or coroner in these cities,  when someone dies, can take any tissues from your body that could have  some medical value. Then they’re transferred to a broker or two, who  then eventually transfers them to surgeons or hospitals. At each step,  there is a hefty fee paid. And then the institution pays a fee. So  although it’s against the law technically to sell an organ or sell these  tissues, from my point of view they are actually being sold. </p>
<p>And  then of course medical research conducted by private corporations or in  which private corporations pay medical institutions to conduct research  according to the corporations’ dictate, which means they control it. So  one thing they have begun doing is exploiting a 1996 law that governs  medical research, which says that if you are in the United States and  you’re the victim of a trauma — shot in the chest, a heart attack, hit  by a car — medical research can be conducted on you without your  permission. </p>

<p>I have spoken to research subjects who had no idea  that they were used in medical research until a member of their family  told them. We all expect that we’re going to be offered informed  consent. In medical research, this is an exception. </p>
<p><b>BJ: Is there any legislation you know of today that is being introduced to address these issues?</b></p>
<p>HW:  I know of no legislation that is being promoted or that even has been  suggested. I think it’s because so few members of the public even know  it’s going on. You can’t fight something if you don’t know it exists.  And I find it really interesting that, although a few medical journals  have called me and interviewed me about this, it’s not being published  someplace where a great many people will read it.</p>
<p>I wrote an  article for a magazine — and I’ll be prudent and I won’t name it — a  popular magazine with a very large circulation. They said they loved the  article, they’d love to publish it, right up to the moment where I got a  phone call saying they were killing it and then they paid me for it  anyway. </p>
<p><b>BJ: And what about the “consensual” situation,  when a patient is made to sign a consent form right before going into  surgery? That might be legal, but it’s also very misleading, no?</b> </p>
<p>HW:  That’s consensual. But the legality of doing this is actually kind of  shadowy. I don’t think it’s been well established whether it’s legal or  not to take somebody’s tissues in surgery without asking their  permission first. So what happened is researchers and corporations had  decided to cover themselves by getting people in this scenario to sign a  consent form and the difficulty, as you suggested, is whether people  really understand what they’re signing. </p>
<p>But the piece of paper,  the consent form, is not informed consent. If you have a signed consent  form in a file and you go to court, that’s not proof of informed  consent. That’s only one piece of evidence to support your claim that  you informed the person. Actual informed consent is an ongoing process  between the researcher and the subject. You have to not only tell them  all the information about the study, about what’s known about the  consequences, but also if new information emerges you have to keep the  person apprised of that. That’s informed consent. </p>
<p>What they’re  doing is they’re having signed a consent form to try to prove that  they’ve given these people informed consent. But the truth is, you know,  if you’re a hospital patient and it’s six o’clock in the morning, and  you’re still groggy from your sleeping medication from the night before,  you’re woken, handed a sheet of forms to sign for surgery you  presumably need and there are staff people standing around you…that’s  not conducive to informed consent.</p>
<p>Most patients don’t read it,  but that’s kind of logical. You know, you need this surgery. The last  thing you want to do the second before you go under the knife is  antagonize the people who are doing your surgery.</p>

</a><b><br />
</b> Over many years, the media and corporations have mounted a concerted effort to demean religious faith and to portray certain religious groups as dangerous to modern society.  Darwin and evolution are often the means, pitting “modern science” against “religious dogma.”  </p>
<p>The problem is that “science” has become the pawn of the corporations.  People are recognizing that very keenly as they watch the endless lies by Monsanto about genetically engineered food be exposed.</p>
<p>A recent Stanford “study,” blasted all over the country by media, purporting to show that organic food is no different from pesticide-ridden crops, is a <a href="http://www.allgov.com/news/top-stories/researchers-of-anti-organic-report-funded-by-agribusiness-120916?news=845321">prime example</a>, with only a bit of investigating revealing that the person behind the study had once done bogus studies for the Tobacco Industry as well.  The study is so loose with reality that it even says agribusiness “<a href="http://news.stanford.edu/pr/2010/pr-agriculture-global-warming-061410.html">slows pace of global warming</a>” even though agribusiness’s <a href="http://www.opednews.com/articles/Global-warming--pill-by-p-by-Linn-Cohen-Cole-081122-465.html">seeds</a> (and the pharmaceutical industries vaccines and pills) are based on petrochemicals, central to driving global warming.</p>
<p>Science is being cavalierly twisted by the corporations and media, and in a direction that is anti-life.  One of the most important protections people have against such falsehoods is, ironically, religious belief.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>That belief is meant to be based on conscience and morality.  It was the <a href="http://www.salem-news.com/articles/september072012/truth-love-tr.php">truth-filled, loving force</a> that rid India of the British Empire.  It was a strong force against the Vietnam War as <a href="http://www.vietnamwar.net/Berrigan.htm">priests were willing to go to jail</a> to stop it. It is a force in Burma where <a href="http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1663397,00.html">Buddhist monks</a> have stood against a repressive government. It is a force in Tibet now as monks have <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/nov/10/burning-martyrs-tibetan-monks-fire">burned themselves to death</a> in response to the totalitarian Chinese rule attempting to stamp out religious life there. There has been a demonization of those opposed to abortion, but has anyone stopped to think what it would mean for this culture to be fine with killing fetuses, not faced with the moral questions raised by those arguing we have no right to take a life?  </p>
<div align="center">
</div>
<p>
Right now, true concern for health is being ignored by the WHO, which has turned its back on <a href="http://foodfreedomgroup.com/2012/04/17/india-vaccine-induced-polio/">47,500</a> children paralyzed by Bill Gates’ polio campaign in India as well as children damaged or killed in Pakistan.  The WHO, the World Bank and Gates are using media to tell the world that the vaccines are eliminating polio, when in fact the scientific community has known for 10 years that it can never be eliminated now that the biotech industry has synthesized the virus (which is twice as deadly as wild polio).  Corporate media is a means to seek funds to continue this <a href="http://foodfreedomgroup.com/2012/05/25/real-simple-mag-47500-paralyzed/">catastrophe</a>, even suggesting American women personally participate, and to hide from the world that, in fact, polio is being systematically spread across Asia and Africa.  </p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/vaccinetruth.html" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em" target="_blank"><img alt="" height="175" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-38G3VOJQToQ/TfAZ2bc-qRI/AAAAAAAAJQ8/LA-TGAvVeWk/250x250-b.jpg" width="200"></a>When imams in Africa or groups in Asia object to vaccines, worried that children are being crippled and dying, media is used to assault them for being anti-science, anti-progress, and often imply religious stupidity.  Yet it was a religious group that exposed the <a href="http://www.engdahl.oilgeopolitics.net/Swine_Flu/Gates_Vaccines/gates_vaccines.html">reality</a> of tetanus vaccines being used to sterilize people.  </p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>Americans are aware that the country is being plundered – losing its homes, its jobs, its farms, its access to real food, its economy, its rights – by politicians and corporations both operating without moral values.  Americans’ bodies are also under assault.  If those bodies can be made ill, they become the source, over a lifetime of sickness, of a fortune for corporations selling vaccines.</p>
<p> This is another form of the <a href="http://www.japanesepopsongs.com/idiotcycle/">Idiot Cycle</a>, in which the companies which sicken people with their toxins then provide the “medicines” to treat those illnesses.  </p>
<p>Religious belief is a sizable roadblock to such power, and when it comes to vaccines, it is precisely moral commitment to the life of children and of their community that has stood in the way.  That morality often (though not solely) comes from religious belief.</p>
<p>In that context, it is vital to note what is occurring in the US in terms of efforts to undermine religious rights.  </p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>The <b>religious exemption</b> to vaccination is now under heavy attack across the country. In the video below, Barbara Loe Fisher, co-founder of the National Vaccine Information Center (NVIC), discusses this important exemption, and why it’s so vital we defend our right to opt out of vaccinations for medical, religious, or conscientious belief reasons. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>All Americans need to know their options for legally opting-out of vaccinations, and you also need to know why it’s so important to protect this legal option, whether you choose to use every federally recommended vaccine for yourself and your children or not.(<a href="http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2012/09/18/vaccine-exemptions.aspx?e_cid=20120918_DNL_art_2">Source</a>)</p>

<p>The Nuremberg Code was established after the Holocaust to prevent the <a href="http://www4.dr-rath-foundation.org/PHARMACEUTICAL_BUSINESS/history_of_the_pharmaceutical_industry.htm">pharmaceutical industry</a> from ever again forcing “medical procedures” on people against their wil.  It is this defense against such industry power that is under attack.  Without exemptions, people would be forced to submit their children to vaccines (and perhaps submit themselves if laws are written to include adults).  As it is becoming clear the vaccines are actually causing diseases, people are also recognizing that there is <a href="http://www4.dr-rath-foundation.org/PHARMACEUTICAL_BUSINESS/laws_of_the_pharmaceutical_industry.htm">profit in diseases</a> (the article is by a Jewish cardiologist).</p>

<p>People, faced with the thought that vaccines may not in fact be the saving miracle of modern medicine, often fall back on what they have been told about the polio and smallpox vaccines as evidence of people’s lives being saved.  Polio and smallpox are the big threats that leave people vulnerable to doing whatever the government says if thet announce an outbreak of some infectious disease.  Yet what we were told about the polio vaccine is as <a href="http://foodfreedomgroup.com/2012/04/17/the-polio-game/">false</a> as what we have been told about the <a href="http://thinktwice.com/smallpox.htm">Smallpox</a> vaccine.  We have been fed fear on a steady basis so the public will be willing to submit to whatever “solution” is suggested.  </p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/vaccineexempt.html" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-WfI77BHRfFg/TpHdZMZJHeI/AAAAAAAALS4/KDabWFqA1jM/s200/AVGLE2.0-CD.jpg"></a>West Nile virus is the latest such scare, with people being told it’s incurable and that spraying of toxic chemicals to kill mosquitoes must be done.  Yet West Nile virus has <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/036852_Dallas_West_Nile_aerial_spraying.html#ixzz26PGiOSwd">never even been isolated</a> and may actually be a collections of symptoms related to toxins (in which case spraying more is an even more terrible idea that people know it already is), and there is <a href="http://curezone.com/forums/fm.asp?i=269396">cure</a> but it has been suppressed (as was an easy <a href="http://www.seanet.com/~alexs/ascorbate/199x/landwehr-r-j_orthomol_med-1991-v6-n2-p99.htm">cure for polio</a>). </p>
<p>(In fact, there is a proven cure for over 70 infectious diseases – meningitis, anthrax, hepatitis, dengue, West Nile, polio, swine flu, etc.  See this <a href="http://www.medfoxpub.com/cgi-bin/start.cgi/medfoxnews/PrimalPanacea.html">video</a>), making vaccines obsolete, even if they weren’t dangerous.)</p>
<p>What if a Smallpox outbreak (or any other disease) were announced and the CDC said everyone must get the vaccine?  Here is where religious exemptions become vital as a means to refuse, for the <a href="http://www.gaia-health.com/articles401/000419-smallpox-vaccine-outbreak.shtml">CDC has admitted the small pox vaccine caused Smallpox</a>.  And in addition, the CDC has admitted <a href="http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/smallpox/vaccination/pdf/heartproblems.pdf">the vaccine causes heart problems</a> and warns people should not get it if (quote):</p>
<ul>
<li>You have been told by a doctor that you have high blood pressure.</li>
<li>You have been told by a doctor that you have high blood cholesterol.</li>
<li>You have been told by a doctor that you have diabetes or high blood sugar.</li>
<li>You have a first degree relative (for example mother, father, brother, or sister) who had a heart condition before the age of 50.</li>
</ul>
<p>Powerful governments have a long history of undermining religious belief.  In its quiet way, such beliefs stand against power and support the moral life and spiritual grounding of human beings.  “Science” captured by corporations has been used to demean religious belief.  Those same corporations have used media to promote vaccines, to cover up crippling and deaths, and to suppress actual cures.  So human thoughts based on moral beliefs are vital protection for life.  The assault on religious exemptions for vaccines is meant to remove morality as a roadblock to profits.  </p>
<p>Just as morality in general is critical to maintain and even to expand, so too are religious exemptions.  Some people may use such exemptions to say “No” to vaccines because they believe they violate a deeply held religious conviction that the body is a blessed gift from God and may not be intruded on by a government.  Some may say “No” to being experimented on based on a historical awareness that the pharmaceutical industry worked to develop a means to sterilize people at doctor’s appointments without their knowing.  Others may fight for religious exemption because they see the Nuremberg Code as a phoenix rising out of the Holocaust and believe it is their religious obligation to protect it (“the informed consent” of religious exemptions) as part of “Never again.”  Other may from religious conviction object to the immorality of an industry generating “diseases for profits.”</p>
<p>Whatever the moral conviction, religious exemptions to vaccines are a spiritual counterbalance to power and profit, and in that, they are essential to all Americans.</p>

<p>Science never ceases to question. When a theory is taught as an unquestionable fact, it should be quite obvious that something is wrong. Today, science isn’t really science, and this is not only true for topics such as evolution, it’s true in many areas where science is used for an agenda by powerful and corrupt forces.</p>
<p>Health sciences are a great example. As Bud Relman, former editor of the New England Journal of Medicine said: </p>
<p>“The medical profession is being bought by the pharmaceutical industry, not only in terms of the practice of medicine, but also in terms of teaching and research. The academic institutions of this country are allowing themselves to be the paid agents of the pharmaceutical industry. I think it’s disgraceful.”</p>

<p><a name="more"></a>Today, some scientific publications are silenced and others are pushed forward, depending on how they affect corporate and political agendas. It’s not actually about the science. What the mainstream media preaches as “settled science” is not actually settled. </p>
<p>In fact it is often highly dubious. Why don’t more people see this? The answer is simple, it’s because we rely on outside sources to tell us ‘what is,’ instead of taking the time, as individual researchers, to really look into something.</p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><b><span style="font-size: large">The Theory Of Evolution</span></b></span></p>
<p>The ‘<a href="http://humansarefree.com/2013/12/9-scienctific-facts-prove-theory-of.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Theory of Evolution</a>’ falls into this category. Scientists who have rejected the basic premises of Darwin’s theory continue to be condemned and shunned by the mainstream community and powerful people.</p>
<p>This is because their paradigm-shifting thoughts and ideas on the subject, though more grounded in fact, threaten the goal of the global elite, which NSA whistleblower William Binney says, is “total population control.” </p>
<p>The average person who gets a bachelor’s degree in science is trained to simply repeat the same old textbook rhetoric as to why evolution is the be all and end all of human existence, without actually looking into why the theory is highly questionable.</p>
<p>One of the latest dissenters is David Gelernter, a prominent scientist and distinguished professor of computer science at Yale University. He recently published an <a href="https://www.claremont.org/crb/article/giving-up-darwin/?intcmp=gvsl_www1.cbn.com-cbnnews-us-2019-august-respected-yale-prof-turns-back-on-evolution-says-darwinism-is-a-religion-and-intelligent-design-is-serious-option_1_recentessay" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">essay</a> in the Claremont Review of Books explaining his objections to a premise behind Darwin’s theory.</p>
<p>He first points to the famous “Cambrian Explosion” which occurred half a billion years ago, in which a number of new organisms, including the first ever known animals, pop up suddenly in the fossil record over a period of approximately 70 million years.</p>
<p>Apparently, this giant explosion of spontaneous life was followed by evolution, slow growth and “scanty fossils, mainly of single celled organisms, dating back to the origins of life roughly three and a half billions years ago.”</p>
<p>From here, he explains how Darwin’s theory predicts that new life forms evolve gradually from preceding ones. but if this is applied to the Cambrian creatures as well, it doesn’t work. The predecessors to the Cambrian creatures are missing, something that Darwin himself was disturbed by as well. </p>
<p>Furthermore, even without this fact, many scientists have already used other aspects of the fossil record to demonstrate that Darwin’s theory is clearly wrong.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Cambrian explosion had been unearthed, and beneath those Cambrian creatures their Precambrian predecessors should have been waiting – and weren’t. In fact, the fossil record as a whole lacked the upward-branching structure Darwin predicted… the ever-expanding fossil archives don’t look good for Darwin, who made clear and concrete predictions that have (so far) been falsified — according to many reputable paleontologists, anyway. </p>
<p>&#8220;When does the clock run out on those predictions? Never. But any thoughtful person must ask himself whether scientists today are looking for evidence that bears on Darwin, or looking to explain away evidence that contradicts him. There are some of each. Scientists are only human, and their thinking (like everyone else’s) is colored by emotion.&#8221; (<a href="https://www.claremont.org/crb/article/giving-up-darwin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source</a>)</p>

<p>His next point goes a little deeper. Many people point to the fact that variation occurs naturally among individuals and different traits are past on, this is something observable and something that we all know. Many scientists actually use this point as a proof for evolution, which doesn’t make much sense. </p>
<p>According to proponents of the theory of evolution, natural variation is the consequence of random change or mutation to cells, to the genetic information within our cells that deal with reproduction. These cells pass on genetic change to the next generation, which, according to Darwinians, changes the future of the species and not just the individual.</p>
<p>The engine behind this thought, as Gelernter explains, is ‘change’ driven by the survival of the fittest and, obviously, lots and lots of time. He then goes on to ask a very crucial question: What exactly does generating new forms of life entail?</p>
<p>Many within the field agree that generating a new shape of protein is the key to it. But does Darwinian evolution even purport to be able to do that? For <a href="https://dissentfromdarwin.org/2008/08/11/chris_williams_phd_biochemistr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris Williams</a>, A Ph.D., Biochemistry Ohio State University, the full scope of Darwinian Evolution barely touches upon this important matter:</p>
<p>&#8220;As a biochemist and software developer who works in genetic and metabolic screening, I am continually amazed by the incredible complexity of life. For example, each of us has a vast ‘computer program’ of six billion DNA bases in every cell that guided our development from a fertilized egg, specifies how to make more than 200 tissue types, and ties all this together in numerous highly functional organ systems. </p>
<p>&#8220;Few people outside of genetics or biochemistry realize that evolutionists still can provide no substantive details at all about the origin of life, and particularly the origin of genetic information in the first self-replicating organism. What genes did it require — or did it even have genes?</p>
<p>&#8220;How much DNA and RNA did it have — or did it even have nucleic acids? How did huge information-rich molecules arise before natural selection? Exactly how did the genetic code linking nucleic acids to amino acid sequence originate? Clearly the origin of life — the foundation of evolution – is still virtually all speculation, and little if no fact.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><b><span style="font-size: large">Intelligent Design</span></b></span></p>
<p>More and more, the evidence points to the great intelligence apparent in the system of life-creation. The reason that <a href="http://humansarefree.com/2013/12/9-scienctific-facts-prove-theory-of.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Darwinian Evolution</a> is being left behind, and for many is obsolete, is because it is completely based on random, non-intelligent processes. </p>
<p><a href="https://dissentfromdarwin.org/scientists/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Edward Peltzer</a> Ph.D. Oceanography, University of California, San Diego (Scripps Institute), Associate Editor, Marine Chemistry, uses a clear real-life laboratory example to explain the need to posit the existence of an overriding ‘intelligence’ in order for things to make any sense:</p>
<p>&#8220;As a chemist, the most fascinating issue for me revolves around the origin of life. Before life began, there was no biology, only chemistry — and chemistry is the same for all time. What works (or not) today, worked (or not) back in the beginning.</p>
<p>&#8220;So, our ideas about what happened on Earth prior to the emergence of life are eminently testable in the lab. And what we have seen thus far when the reactions are left unguided as they would be in the natural world is not much. Indeed, the decomposition reactions and competing reactions out distance the synthetic reactions by far. </p>
<p>&#8220;It is only when an intelligent agent (such as a scientist or graduate student) intervenes and “tweaks” the reactions conditions “just right” do we see any progress at all, and even then it is still quite limited and very far from where we need to get. </p>
<p>&#8220;Thus, it is the very chemistry that speaks of a need for something more than just time and chance. And whether that be simply a highly specified set of initial conditions (fine-tuning) or some form of continual guidance until life ultimately emerges is still unknown.</p>
<p>&#8220;But what we do know is the random chemical reactions are both woefully insufficient and are often working against the pathways needed to succeed. For these reasons I have serious doubts about whether the current Darwinian paradigm will ever make additional progress in this area.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gelernter brings this conversation specifically to the generation of proteins:</p>
<p>&#8220;Proteins are the special ops forces (or maybe the Marines) of living cells, except that they are common instead of rare; they do all the heavy lifting, all the tricky and critical assignments, in a dazzling range of roles.</p>
<p>&#8220;Proteins called enzymes catalyze all sorts of reactions and drive cellular metabolism. Other proteins (such as collagen) give cells shape and structure, like tent poles but in far more shapes. Nerve function, muscle function, and photosynthesis are all driven by proteins. And in doing these jobs and many others, the actual, 3-D shape of the protein molecule is important.</p>
<p>&#8220;So, is the simple neo-Darwinian mechanism up to this task? Are random mutation plus natural selection sufficient to create new protein shapes?&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><b><span style="font-size: large">Diving Into Proteins</span></b></span></p>
<p>Gelernter goes on to answer that question in great detail, and after going through the entire explanation he comes to what seems to be an inarguable conclusion. That the <a href="http://humansarefree.com/2013/12/9-scienctific-facts-prove-theory-of.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Theory of Evolution</a> cannot, in any way, be a possible explanation for the generation of new proteins and mutations that are required for evolution to occur at all. </p>
<p>This explanation is complex, but well worth it if you really want to understand how the ‘Theory of Evolution’ is refuted by the science of proteins:</p>
<p>&#8220;How to make proteins is our first question. Proteins are chains: linear sequences of atom-groups, each bonded to the next. A protein molecule is based on a chain of amino acids; 150 elements is a “modest-sized” chain; the average is 250. Each link is chosen, ordinarily, from one of 20 amino acids. A chain of amino acids is a polypeptide — “peptide” being the type of chemical bond that joins one amino acid to the next. </p>
<p>&#8220;But this chain is only the starting point: chemical forces among the links make parts of the chain twist themselves into helices; others straighten out, and then, sometimes, jackknife repeatedly, like a carpenter’s rule, into flat sheets. Then the whole assemblage folds itself up like a complex sheet of origami paper. And the actual 3-D shape of the resulting molecule is (as I have said) important.</p>
<p>&#8220;Imagine a 150-element protein as a chain of 150 beads, each bead chosen from 20 varieties. But: only certain chains will work. Only certain bead combinations will form themselves into stable, useful, well-shaped proteins.</p>
<p>&#8220;So how hard is it to build a useful, well-shaped protein? Can you throw a bunch of amino acids together and assume that you will get something good? Or must you choose each element of the chain with painstaking care? It happens to be very hard to choose the right beads.</p>
<p>&#8220;Inventing a new protein means inventing a new gene. (Enter, finally, genes, DNA etc., with suitable fanfare.) Genes spell out the links of a protein chain, amino acid by amino acid. Each gene is a segment of DNA, the world’s most admired macromolecule. DNA, of course, is the famous double helix or spiral staircase, where each step is a pair of nucleotides. </p>
<p>&#8220;As you read the nucleotides along one edge of the staircase (sitting on one step and bumping your way downwards to the next and the next), each group of three nucleotides along the way specifies an amino acid. Each three-nucleotide group is a codon, and the correspondence between codons and amino acids is the genetic code. (The four nucleotides in DNA are abbreviated T, A, C and G, and you can look up the code in a high school textbook: TTA and TTC stand for phenylalanine, TCT for serine, and so on.)</p>
<p>&#8220;Your task is to invent a new gene by mutation — by the accidental change of one codon to a different codon. You have two possible starting points for this attempt. You could mutate an existing gene, or mutate gibberish. You have a choice because DNA actually consists of valid genes separated by long sequences of nonsense. Most biologists think that the nonsense sequences are the main source of new genes. </p>
<p>&#8220;If you tinker with a valid gene, you will almost certainly make it worse — to the point where its protein misfires and endangers (or kills) its organism — long before you start making it better. The gibberish sequences, on the other hand, sit on the sidelines without making proteins, and you can mutate them, so far as we know, without endangering anything. </p>
<p>&#8220;The mutated sequence can then be passed on to the next generation, where it can be mutated again. Thus mutations can accumulate on the sidelines without affecting the organism. But if you mutate your way to an actual, valid new gene, your new gene can create a new protein and thereby, potentially, play a role in evolution.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mutations themselves enter the picture when DNA splits in half down the center of the staircase, thereby allowing the enclosing cell to split in half, and the encompassing organism to grow. Each half-staircase summons a matching set of nucleotides from the surrounding chemical soup; two complete new DNA molecules emerge. A mistake in this elegant replication process — the wrong nucleotide answering the call, a nucleotide typo — yields a mutation, either to a valid blueprint or a stretch of gibberish.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now at last we are ready to take Darwin out for a test drive. Starting with 150 links of gibberish, what are the chances that we can mutate our way to a useful new shape of protein? We can ask basically the same question in a more manageable way: what are the chances that a random 150-link sequence will create such a protein? Nonsense sequences are essentially random. Mutations are random. Make random changes to a random sequence and you get another random sequence. </p>
<p>&#8220;So, close your eyes, make 150 random choices from your 20 bead boxes and string up your beads in the order in which you chose them. What are the odds that you will come up with a useful new protein?</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s easy to see that the total number of possible sequences is immense. It’s easy to believe (although non-chemists must take their colleagues’ word for it) that the subset of useful sequences — sequences that create real, usable proteins — is, in comparison, tiny. But we must know how immense and how tiny.</p>
<p>&#8220;The total count of possible 150-link chains, where each link is chosen separately from 20 amino acids, is 20150. In other words, many. 20150 roughly equals 10195, and there are only 1080 atoms in the universe.</p>
<p>&#8220;What proportion of these many polypeptides are useful proteins? Douglas Axe did a series of experiments to estimate how many 150-long chains are capable of stable folds — of reaching the final step in the protein-creation process (the folding) and of holding their shapes long enough to be useful.</p>
<p>&#8220;(Axe is a distinguished biologist with five-star breeding: he was a graduate student at Caltech, then joined the Centre for Protein Engineering at Cambridge. The biologists whose work Meyer discusses are mainly first-rate Establishment scientists.) </p>
<p>&#8220;He estimated that, of all 150-link amino acid sequences, 1 in 1074 will be capable of folding into a stable protein. To say that your chances are 1 in 1074 is no different, in practice, from saying that they are zero. It’s not surprising that your chances of hitting a stable protein that performs some useful function, and might therefore play a part in evolution, are even smaller. Axe puts them at 1 in 1077.</p>
<p>&#8220;In other words: immense is so big, and tiny is so small, that neo-Darwinian evolution is — so far — a dead loss. Try to mutate your way from 150 links of gibberish to a working, useful protein and you are guaranteed to fail. Try it with ten mutations, a thousand, a million — you fail. The odds bury you. It can’t be done.</p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><b><span style="font-size: large">Proteins / Mutations Are One of Several Issues</span></b></span></p>
<p>Despite all of the scientific dogma that plagues this issue, proteins/mutations and lack of fossil evidence are simply the tip of the iceberg when it comes to finding faults found within the <a href="http://humansarefree.com/2013/12/9-scienctific-facts-prove-theory-of.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Theory of Evolution</a>. There are many facts, information, science and new discoveries that would make one wonder how it’s even still being taught.</p>
<p>Furthermore, despite the fact that we get pounded with the idea that random mutation is ultimate truth within the mainstream, and that one is wrong for questioning it, there are a number of prominent scientists, who are actually getting together in large numbers to collectively refute Darwinism. </p>
<p>A group of 500 scientists from several fields came together a few years to create “<a href="https://dissentfromdarwin.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism</a>,” as one examples. The issue is that these scientists are never getting any mainstream attention. But clearly there are some very intelligent people here.</p>
<p>&#8220;The theory will be with us for a long time, exerting enormous cultural force. Darwin is no Newton. Newton’s physics survived Einstein and will always survive, because it explains the cases that dominate all of space-time except for the extreme ends of the spectrum, at the very smallest and largest scales.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s just these most important cases, the ones we see all around us, that Darwin cannot explain. Yet his theory does explain cases of real significance. And Darwin’s intellectual daring will always be inspiring. The man will always be admired.</p>
<p>&#8220;He now poses a final challenge. Whether biology will rise to this last one as well as it did to the first, when his theory upset every apple cart, remains to be seen. How cleanly and quickly can the field get over Darwin, and move on? — with due allowance for every Darwinist’s having to study all the evidence for himself? There is one of most important questions facing science in the 21st century.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><b><span style="font-size: large">Other Examples That Throw Off The Theory Of Evolution</span></b></span></p>
<p>Not long ago <a href="https://www.collective-evolution.com/2018/05/15/33-scientists-publish-paper-suggesting-octopuses-arrived-as-extraterrestrial-imports-to-earth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I wrote about</a> a recent paper <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079610718300798?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">published by 33 scientists</a> in the Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology journal suggesting that the flourishing of life during the Cambrian era (Cambrian Explosion) <a href="http://humansarefree.com/2018/05/33-scientists-say-that-octopuses-are.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">originates from the stars</a> is so fascinating.</p>
<p>“With the rapidly increasing number of exoplanets that have been discovered in the habitable zones of long-lived red dwarf stars (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079610718300798?via%3Dihub#bib11a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gillon et al., 2016</a>), the prospects for genetic exchanges between life-bearing Earth-like planets cannot be ignored. ” (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079610718300798?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The study</a>)</p>
<p>There is a great little blurb from <a href="https://cosmosmagazine.com/biology/viruses-et-and-the-octopus-from-space-the-return-of-panspermia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmos Magazine</a>, one of the few outlets who are talking about the study:</p>
<p>With 33 authors from a wide range of reputable universities and research institutes, the paper makes a seemingly incredible claim. A claim that if true, would have the most profound consequences for our understanding of the universe. Life, the paper argues, did not originate on the planet Earth.</p>
<p>The response?</p>
<p>Near silence.</p>
<p>The reasons for this are as fascinating as the evidence and claims advanced by the paper itself. Entitled “Cause of the Cambrian Explosion – Terrestrial or Cosmic?”, the publication revives a controversial idea concerning the origin of life, an idea stretching back to Ancient Greece, known as ‘panspermia.a’.</p>
<p>Academics like Francis Crick, an English scientist who co-discovered the structure of the DNA molecule (alongside James D. Watson), argues that there is no possible way that the DNA molecule could have originated on Earth. The generally accepted theory in this field, as explained above, is that we are the result of a bunch of molecules accidentally bumping into each other, creating life. </p>
<p>However, according to Crick, we are the result of what is now known as <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0019103573901103" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Directed Panspermia</a>. Crick and British chemist Leslie Orgel <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0019103573901103" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">published their paper</a> on it in July of 1973, hinting that we were brought here by chance, or by some sort of intelligence from somewhere else in the universe.</p>
<p>This is interesting, because then you can get into the lore of creation stories that exists within ancient cultures from around the world, one would be our relation to, for example, what many indigenous culture <a href="https://www.collective-evolution.com/2017/01/02/the-star-people-extraterrestrials-from-a-native-american-first-nations-perspective/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">refer to as the ‘Star People</a>.’</p>
<p>I’m not even going to go into all of the strange skeletal remains that have been completely left out of the record, like the remains of giants, for example.</p>

<p><span style="color: blue"><b><span style="font-size: large">The Takeaway</span></b></span></p>
<p>The agenda for the maintenance of the neo-Darwinian version of the ‘<a href="http://humansarefree.com/2013/12/9-scienctific-facts-prove-theory-of.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Theory of Evolution</a>’ was nothing less than to move people away from the notion of an intelligent creator and towards a perception founded in scientific materialism. In this way, those who funded and controlled scientific activity on the planet would have tremendous power.</p>
<p>Darwin’s theory may have served humanity for a certain phase of our own evolution, but now it is holding us back. It’s time for all of us to pierce more deeply into an understanding of the nature of the creation of life if we are to become creators ourselves by studying the current evidence.</p>

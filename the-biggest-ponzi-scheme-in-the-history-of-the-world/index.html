<b><a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2013/06/the-biggest-ponzi-scheme-in-history-of.html">Activist Post</a></b></p>
<p>Did you know that you are involved in the most massive Ponzi scheme  that has ever existed? To illustrate my point, allow me to tell you a  little story. Once upon a time, there was a man named Sam. When he was  younger, he had been a very principled young man that had worked  incredibly hard and that had built a large number of tremendously  successful businesses. He became fabulously wealthy and he accumulated  far more gold than anyone else on the planet.</p>
<p>But when he started to  get a little older he forgot the values of his youth. He started making  really bad decisions and some of his relatives started to take  advantage of him. One particularly devious relative was a nephew named  Fred. One day Fred approached his uncle Sam with a scheme that his  friends the bankers had come up with. What happened next would change  the course of Sam’s life forever.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>Even though Sam was the wealthiest man in the world by far, Fred  convinced Sam that he could have an even higher standard of living by  going into a little bit of debt.  In exchange for IOUs issued by his  uncle Sam, Fred would give him paper notes that he printed off on his  printing press.  Since the paper notes would be backed by the gold that  Sam was holding, everyone would consider them to be valuable.  Sam could  take those paper notes and spend them on whatever his heart desired. Uncle Sam started to do this, and he started to become addicted to all  of the nice things that those paper notes would buy him.</p>
<p>Fred took the IOUs that he received from his uncle and he auctioned  them off to the bankers.  But there was a problem.  The IOUs issued by  Uncle Sam had to be paid back with interest. When the time came to pay  back the IOUs, Uncle Sam could not afford to pay back the debts, pay the  interest on those debts, and buy all of the nice things that he  wanted. So Uncle Sam issued even more IOUs than before so that he could  get enough notes to pay off his debts.  As time rolled on, this pattern  just kept on repeating.  Uncle Sam repeatedly paid off his old debts by  taking out even larger new debts.</p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>
Meanwhile, since the notes that Uncle Sam was using were backed by  gold, everyone else in the world decided to start using them to trade  with one another.  This was greatly beneficial to Uncle Sam, because the  rest of the world was glad to send him oil, home electronics, plastic  trinkets and anything else that Uncle Sam wanted in exchange for his  gold-backed notes.</p>
<p>Eventually, however, the rest of the world started to suspect that  the number of gold-backed notes that Uncle Sam was issuing far exceeded  the amount of gold that Uncle Sam actually had. So the rest of the  world started to trade in their notes for gold.</p>
<p>And by that time Uncle Sam definitely did not have enough gold to  back up his notes.  Realizing that the scheme was starting to collapse,  one day Uncle Sam announced that his notes would no longer be backed by  gold.  But he insisted that the rest of the world should continue using  his notes because he was the wealthiest man on the planet and everyone  should just trust him.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/backyardliberty.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-k0NQ-rOJPq0/UPDSF5crnFI/AAAAAAAATcw/i7Q6pBk-hoQ/s200/BL_013-200.gif"></a>And the rest of the world did continue to trust him, although it wasn’t the same as before.</p>
<p>As Uncle Sam got greedier and greedier, he started to issue IOUs and  spend notes at a rate that nobody ever dreamed possible.  The great  businesses that Uncle Sam had built when he was younger were starting to  decline, and Uncle Sam started buying far more stuff from the rest of  the world than they bought from him.  The rest of the world was still  glad to take Uncle Sam’s notes because they used them to trade with one  another, but they started accumulating far more notes than they actually  needed.</p>
<p>Not sure exactly what to do with mountains of these notes, the rest  of the world started to loan them back to Uncle Sam.  It eventually got  to the point where Uncle Sam owed the rest of the world trillions of  these notes.  Even though the notes were losing value at a rate of close  to 10 percent a year, Uncle Sam somehow convinced the rest of the world  to loan him notes at an average rate of interest of less than 3 percent  a year.</p>
<p>One day Uncle Sam woke up and realized that the amount of debt that  he owed was now more than 5000 times larger than it was when Fred had  first approached him with this ill-fated scheme.  Uncle Sam now owed  more than 16 trillion notes to his creditors, and Uncle Sam had already  made future financial commitments of <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-08-11/u-s-is-bankrupt-and-we-don-t-even-know-commentary-by-laurence-kotlikoff.html" target="_blank" title="202 trillion notes">202 trillion notes</a>  that he would never be able to pay.  Meanwhile, the notes that Fred had  been printing up for Uncle Sam were now worth less than 5 percent of  their original value.  Uncle Sam was becoming concerned because some of  his other relatives were warning that this whole scheme was about to  collapse.</p>
<p>Sadly, Uncle Sam did not listen to them. Uncle Sam knew that if he  admitted how fraudulent the financial scheme was, the rest of the world  would quit sending him all of the things that he needed in exchange for  his notes and they would quit lending his notes back to him at super low  interest rates.<br />
And if the rest of the world lost confidence in his notes and quit  using them, Uncle Sam knew that his standard of living would go way, way  down.  That was something that Uncle Sam could not bear to have happen.</p>
<p>When a financial crisis almost caused the scheme to crash in 2008, a  desperate Uncle Sam went to Fred and asked for help. In response, Fred  started printing up far more notes than ever before and started directly  buying up large amounts of IOUs from Uncle Sam with the notes that he  was creating out of thin air.  Fred hoped that the rest of the world  would not notice what he was doing.</p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/goingglobal.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/_qLAIskTQXUc/TZ9T4BhStII/AAAAAAAAIHA/WjeJNPu91cA/Banner1_180x150.jpg"></a>It seemed to work for a little while, but then an even worse  financial crisis came along.  Once again, Uncle Sam started issuing  massive amounts of new IOUs and Fred started printing up giant mountains  of new notes to try to fix things, but their desperate attempts to keep  the system going were to no avail.  The rest of the world started to  realize that they had been sucked into a massive Ponzi scheme, and they  lost confidence in the notes that Uncle Sam was using.  Suddenly nobody  wanted to lend notes to Uncle Sam at super low interest rates anymore,  and people started asking for far more notes in exchange for the things  that Uncle Sam wanted.</p>
<p>Uncle Sam’s standard of living dropped dramatically.  Since he could  no longer flood the world with his notes, Uncle Sam could not continue  to consume far, far more wealth than he produced.  Uncle Sam sunk into a  deep depression as he watched the scheme fall apart all around him.</p>
<p>Uncle Sam had once been the wealthiest man on the entire planet, but  now he was a broke, tired old man that was absolutely drowning in debt.   Unfortunately, once he was down on his luck the rest of the world did  not have any compassion for him.  In fact, much of the rest of the world  celebrated the downfall of Uncle Sam.</p>

<p>All of this could have been avoided if Uncle Sam had never agreed to  Fred’s crazy scheme. And once Uncle Sam made the decision to stop  backing his notes with gold, it was only a matter of time before the  scheme was going to collapse.</p>
<p>Does this little story sound crazy to you?  It shouldn’t.  The truth  is that you are involved in such a scheme right now.  In case you  haven’t figured it out, “Uncle Sam” is the United States, the “notes”  are U.S. dollars, and “Fred” is the Federal Reserve.</p>
<p>Please share this story with as many people as you can.  Our country  is headed for complete and total financial disaster, and we need to get  people educated about this while there is still time.</p>

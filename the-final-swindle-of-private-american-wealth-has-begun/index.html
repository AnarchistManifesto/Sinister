<p>I began writing analysis on the macro-economic situation of the   American financial structure back in 2006, and in the eight years since,   I have seen an undeniably steady trend of fiscal decline.</p>
<p>I have never had any doubt that the U.S. economy as we know it was  headed for total  and catastrophic collapse, the only question was when,  exactly, the  final trigger event would occur. As I have pointed out in  the past,  economic implosion is a process. It grows over time, like  the ice shelf  on a mountain developing into a potential avalanche. It  is easy to shrug  off the danger because the visible destruction is not  immediate, it is latent; but  when the avalanche finally begins, it is  far too late for most people to  escape….</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>If you view the progressive financial breakdown in America as some   kind of “comedy of errors” or a trial of unlucky coincidences, then   there is not much I can do to educate you on the reasons behind the   carnage. If, however, you understand that there is a deliberate   motivation behind American collapse, then what I have to say here will   not fall on biased ears.</p>
<p>The financial crash of 2008, the same crash which has been ongoing   for years, is NOT an accident. It is a concerted and engineered crisis   meant to position the U.S. for currency disintegration and the   institution of a global basket currency controlled by an unaccountable   supranational governing body like the International Monetary Fund (IMF).   The American populace is being conditioned through economic fear to   accept the institutionalization of global financial control and the loss   of sovereignty.<br />
Anyone skeptical of this conclusion is welcome to study my numerous   past examinations on the issue of globalization; I don’t have the time   within this article to re-explain, and frankly, with so much information   on deliberate dollar destruction available to the public today I’ve  grown tired of  anyone with a lack of awareness.</p>

If you continue to believe that the Fed actually exists to “help”   stabilize our economy or our currency, then you will never find the   logic behind what they do. If you understand that the goal of the Fed   and the globalists is to dismantle the dollar and the U.S. economic   system to make way for something “new”, then certain recent events and   policy initiatives do start to make sense.</p>
<p>The year of 2014 has been looming as a serious concern for me since   the final quarter of 2013, and you can read about those concerns and the  evidence that supports them in my  article <a href="http://www.alt-market.com/articles/1837-expect-devastating-global-economic-changes-in-2014" target="_blank"><i>Expect Devastating Global Economic Changes In 2014</i></a>.</p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>At the end of 2013 we saw at least three major events that could have   sent America spiraling into total collapse. The first was the   announcement of possible taper measures by the Fed, which have now   begun. The second was the possible invasion of Syria which the Obama   Administration is still desperate for despite successful efforts by the   liberty movement to deny him public support for war. And, the third  event  was the last debt ceiling debate (or debt ceiling theater  depending on  how you look at it), which placed the U.S. squarely on the  edge of  fiscal default.</p>
<p>As we begin 2014, these same threatening issues remain (along with  many others), only at  greater levels and with more prominence. New  developments reinforce my  original position that this year will be  remembered by historians as the  year in which the final breakdown of  the U.S. monetary dynamic was set in motion. Here are some of those  developments explained….</p>
<p><b>Taper Of QE3</b></p>
<p>When I first suggested that a Fed taper was not only possible but   probable months ago, I was met with a bit (a lot) of criticism from some  in the  alternative economic world. You can read my taper articles <a href="http://www.alt-market.com/articles/1721-is-the-fed-ready-to-cut-americas-fiat-life-support" target="_blank">here </a>and <a href="http://www.alt-market.com/articles/1889-the-hidden-motives-behind-the-federal-reserve-taper" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>This was understandable. The Fed uses multiple stimulus outlets   besides QE in order to manipulate U.S. markets. Artificially lowering   interest rates is very much a form of stimulus in itself, for instance.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/backyardliberty.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ONE8Lk_RzR8/UjeZnRyZRTI/AAAAAAAAVJw/TMNS4NzHKZo/s220/BL_158220.gif"></a>However, I think a dangerous blindness to threats beyond money   printing has developed within our community of analysts and this must be   remedied. People need to realize first that the Fed does NOT care  about  the continued health of our economy, and they may not care about   presenting a facade of health for much longer either. Alternative   analysts also need to come to grips with the reality that overt money   printing is not the only method at the disposal of globalists when   destroying the greenback. A debt default is just as likely to cause loss   of world reserve status and devaluation – no printing press required.   Blame goes to government and political gridlock while the banks slither   away in the midst of the chaos.</p>
<p>The taper of QE3 is not a “head fake”, it is very real, but there are many hidden motivations behind such cuts.</p>
<p>Currently, $20 billion has been trimmed from the $85 billion per  month  program, and we are already beginning to see what APPEAR to be  market  effects, including a flight from emerging market currencies from   Argentina to Turkey. A couple of years ago investors viewed these   markets as among the few places they could exploit to make a positive  return, or in  other words, one of the few places they could  successfully gamble. The  Fed taper, though, seems to be shifting the  flow of capital away from  emerging markets.</p>
<p>The mainstream argument is that stimulus was flowing into such   markets, giving them liquidity support, and the taper is drying up that   liquidity. Whether this is actually true is hard to say, given that   without a full audit we have no idea how much fiat the Federal Reserve   has actually created and how much of it they send out into foreign   markets.</p>
<p>I stand more on the position that the Fed taper was actually begun in   preparation for a slowdown in global markets that was already in  progress. In fact, I believe central  bankers have been well aware that a  decline in every sector was coming,  and are moving to insulate  themselves.</p>
<p>Is it just a “coincidence” that the central bankers have initiated  their taper of QE right when global manufacturing numbers begin to  plummet?</p>

<p>Is it just “coincidence” the taper was started right when the Baltic  Dry Index, a global indicator of shipping demand, has lost over 50% of  its value in the past few weeks?</p>

<p>No, I do not think any of this is coincidence.  Most if not all of  these negative indicators needed months to generate, so they could not  have been caused by the taper itself.  The only explanation beyond  “coincidence” is that the Federal Reserve WANTED to launch the taper  program and protect itself before these signals began to reach the  public.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/backyardliberty.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-k0NQ-rOJPq0/UPDSF5crnFI/AAAAAAAATcw/i7Q6pBk-hoQ/s200/BL_013-200.gif"></a>Look at it this way – The taper program distances the bankers from   responsibility for crisis in our financial framework, at  least in the  eyes of the general public. If a market calamity takes place  WHILE  stimulus measures are still at full speed, this makes the banks  look  rather guilty, or at least incompetent. People would begin to  question  the validity of central bank methods, and they might even  question the  validity of the central bank’s existence. The Fed is  creating space  between itself and the economy because they know that a  trigger event  is coming. They want to ensure that they are not blamed  and that  stimulus itself is not seen as ineffective, or seen as the cause.</p>
<p>We all know that the claims of recovery are utter nonsense. Beyond  the numerous warning signs listed above, one need  only look at true  unemployment numbers, household wage decline, and record low personal  savings of the average American. The taper is not in response to an  improving economic  environment. Rather, the taper is a signal for the  next stage of  collapse.</p>
<p>Stocks are beginning to plummet around the world and all mainstream   pundits are pointing fingers at a reduction in stimulus which has very  little to do with anything. What is the  message they want us to digest?  That we “can’t live” without the aid and oversight of central banks.</p>
<p>The real reason stocks and other indicators are stumbling is because  the effectiveness of stimulus manipulation has a shelf life,  and that  shelf life is over for the Federal Reserve. I suspect they will   continue cutting QE every month for the next year as stocks decline. Will the Fed restart QE?  If they do, it will probably not occur until  after a substantial breakdown has ensued and the public is sufficiently  shell-shocked.  The possibility also exists that the Fed will never  return to stimulus measures (if debt default is the plan), and QE  stimulus will eventually be replaced by IMF “aid”.</p>
<p><b>Government Controlled Investment</b></p>

</div>
<p>Last month, just as taper measures were being implemented, the White House launched an investment program called MyRA; a <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2014/01/29/retirement/myra-accounts/" target="_blank">retirement IRA program</a> in which middle class and low wage Americans can invest part of their paycheck in government bonds.</p>
<p>That’s right, if you wanted to know where the money was going to come   from to support U.S. debt if the Fed cuts QE, guess what, the money is   going to come from YOU.</p>
<p>For a decade or so China was the primary buyer and crutch for U.S.   debt spending. After the derivatives crash of 2008, the Federal Reserve   became the largest purchaser of Treasury bonds. With the decline of   foreign interest in long term U.S. debt, and the taper in full effect,   it only makes sense that the government would seek out an alternative   source of capital to continue the debt cycle. The MyRA program turns the   general American public into a new cash stream, but there’s more going   on here than meets the eye….</p>
<p>I find it rather suspicious that a government-controlled retirement   program is suddenly introduced just as the Fed has begun to taper, as   stocks are beginning to fall, and as questions arise over the U.S. debt   ceiling. I have three major concerns:</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/familysurvivalsystem.html" rel="nofollow" style="float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-2dxSSyJSY-M/UnqDDNjqNaI/AAAAAAAAV7s/GmrEINt_kNM/s220/imgad.jpg"></a>First, is it possible that like the Fed, the government is also aware   that a crash in stocks is coming? And, are they offering the MyRA   program as an easy outlet (or trap) for people to pour in what little   savings they have as panic over declining equities accelerates?  Bonds  do tend to look appetizing to uninformed investors during an equities  route.</p>
<p>Second, the program is currently voluntary, but what if the plan is   to make it mandatory? Obama has already signed mandatory health   insurance “taxation” into law, which is meant to steal a portion of   every paycheck. Why not steal an even larger portion from every paycheck   in order to support U.S. debt? It’s for the “greater good,” after all.</p>
<p>Third, is this a deliberate strategy to corral the last vestiges of   private American wealth into the corner of U.S. bonds, so that this   wealth can be confiscated or annihilated? What happens if there is   indeed an eventual debt default, as I believe there will be? Will   Americans be herded into bonds by a crisis in stocks only to have bonds   implode as well? Will they be conned into bond investment out of a   “patriotic duty” to save the nation from default? Or, will the   government just take their money through legislative wrangling, as was   done in Cyprus not long ago?</p>
<p><b>The Final Swindle</b></p>
<p>Again, the next debt ceiling debate is slated for the end of this  month. If  the government decides to kick the can down the road for  another  quarter, I believe this will be the last time. The most recent  actions  of the Fed and the government signal preparations for a stock  implosion  and ultimate debt calamity. Default would have immediate  effects in  foreign markets, but the appearance of U.S. stability could  drag on for a  time, giving the globalists ample opportunity to siphon  every ounce of  financial blood from the public.</p>
<p>It is difficult to say how the next year will play out, but one thing   is certain; something very strange and ugly is afoot. The goal of  the  globalists is to engineer desperation. To create a catastrophe and then   force the masses to beg for help. How many hands of “friendship” will  be  offered in the wake of a U.S. wealth and currency crisis? What  offers  for “aid” will come from the IMF? How much of our country and  how many  of our people will be collateralized to secure that aid? And,  how many  Americans will go along with the swindle because they were not  prepared  in advance?</p>

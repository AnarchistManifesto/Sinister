<a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2015/04/new-govt-study-no-link-to-war-and.html"><b>Activist Post</b></a></p>
<p>Back in 2009 President Obama admitted that science has been compromised by political agenda. He of course brought up this topic in the context of … political agenda. Speaking to the <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2009/04/27/obama_speech_academy_of_sciences_transcript_96221.html">National Academy of Sciences</a> Obama said: </p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>Next, we are restoring science to its rightful place. On March 9th, I signed an executive memorandum with a clear message: Under my administration, the days of science taking a back seat to ideology are over. (Applause.) Our progress as a nation — and our values as a nation — are rooted in free and open inquiry. To undermine scientific integrity is to undermine our democracy. It is contrary to our way of life. (Applause.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And as the audience applauded; Obama who has never been known to tell the truth used truth (science is admittedly politicized, tainted and corrupt and no one should believe scientific claims put out by government-sponsored scientists) to offer yet another false hope promise (I will restore science for everyone). No one should be surprised by this political trade-off. Since the science is admittedly corrupt, then I will fix it and you will vote for me again. Despite this promise there is no doubt that the problem still exists today, in fact the problem is worse today. </p>
<p>In yet another example of politicized tainted unreliable junk science, psychology researchers are claiming that a <a href="http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-0202-veteran-suicide-20150402-story.html">new study</a> suggests that being in the military and being deployed to war has no impact on committing suicide!</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>The researchers claim that a difference between a rate of 18.86 deaths per 100,000 for deployed troops versus 17.78 deaths per 100,000 for non-deployed troops is proof that being deployed is “only slightly higher.” And with that researcher, Mark Reger, put out his suggestions with very little evidence. In no time numerous mainstream media organizations jumped on the suggestion and the study was published in <i>JAMA Psychiatry </i>giving this claim new authenticity. </p>

<p>Oh, and who is Mark Reger working for? None other than the Department Of Defense National Center for Telehealth and Technology. Doesn’t this scenario sound familiar? Government-sponsored scientist running studies whose conclusions conveniently favor the military industrial complex, and support endless wars and the long-term plans for the new world order military global takeover? </p>
<p>Is there anyone on the planet who thinks this Department of Defense-funded study would have had a chance of being funded if it revealed the ugly truth about war that we all know? Was there a chance that this government-funded study would reveal that war is the most horrific experience any human being can experience? That war is directly tied to Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and that <a href="http://ptsd.about.com/od/relatedconditions/a/suicide.htm">PTSD</a> is directly linked to increased suicide? That many other studies and facts about depression, war, and PTSD for decades have long settled the issue that the horrors of war destroy the human being mentally and emotionally? </p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/familysurvival.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ASIFGy_z7zU/UCFiDQK8GBI/AAAAAAAAROU/7AHejVY_hUE/s202/3.gif"></a>The horrors of war are undeniable, and this horror is unquestionably linked to mental and emotional trauma. This is not speculation, just talk to those who have been in war. The post-war experience in the words of those who have been there is factually directly linked to stress, anxiety, mental disorders, and ultimately depression and suicide. Even this study admits that. Even this study admits that for those in the Army and Marines who are more often in the actual physical battlefields the suicides are indeed 25% higher, which is contrary to the headline and supposed conclusion. In fact, this study actually confirms what we already know – that going to war is indeed associated with increased suicide, period. </p>
<p>What the analyzers of the study, the media and the reviews of the study attempt to do is spin the results enough to justify the headlines. This spinning is the very undermining of science and the scientific method that Obama was eluding to and what we’ve seen in America now for decades. This once again proves why no one should ever believe any government study whose results are convenient to their agenda. In the end, for the control system’s long-term political agenda, it’s about the interpretation of the data not the data itself. </p>
<p>This is nothing more than an attempt to convince more young men to join the U.S. military and die for bankers’ wars now that the suicide risk has been debunked. This entire study from funding to conclusions is nothing more than military industrial complex junk science and pro-military propaganda lies. </p>
<p>Then, in an even greater leap of disinformation, the study claims that if you don’t go to war – that is, if you actually get out of the military early and don’t complete your full duty time – you have a much <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/02/us/study-finds-no-link-between-military-suicide-rate-and-deployments.html?_r=1">higher risk</a> of committing suicide! </p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>The study found that the suicide rate for troops who left the military before completing a four-year enlistment was nearly twice that of troops who stayed. The rate for troops who were involuntarily discharged under less-than-honorable conditions for disciplinary infractions was nearly three times higher. Troops given these so-called bad paper discharges are often not eligible for Department of Veterans Affairs medical care and other benefits. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>No critical thinking seems to apply to the analysis of these numbers. The crunching of the numbers seem to blur the lines between correlation and direct causation. This is the trademark of government monkey science. Come up with some desired numbers (however necessary) without any real scrutiny for what you did by independent (non-government) scientists and publish to one of the science journals. Once the “publishing” occurs to one of their journals (i.e. <i>JAMA Psychology</i>) then the buzz surrounding the topic makes it seem as though this is the new reality. </p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/crisis/" rel="nofollow" style="clear: left;float: left;margin-bottom: 0em;margin-right: 1em"><img alt="" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Cr4b_paQky0/UG5OZTSlmlI/AAAAAAAAR_A/DgjHL80-ZGM/s200/01-200.gif"></a>The government monkey science steps go something like this:</p>
<p>Do the study yourself to ensure the right results, fund and supervise the study using your own scientists and publishers, come up with the numbers you need to make your “suggestions”, publish in your scientific journals and let the mainstream media do the rest. Is anyone surprised that almost every major <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/nation/2015/04/01/suicide-study-deployment-iraq-afghanistan/70725276/">mainstream media</a> outlet picked up this politically controlled study and published it right away? </p>
<p>Are those who are let go from the military mentally unstable to begin with, and this might be why they commit suicide? Who’s scrutinizing this study and challenging its questionable conclusions? Is the suggestion that unemployment creates a greater risk of suicide than the horrors of war itself believable and reasonable? I don’t think so. There is always a chance to get work somewhere even if it’s low paying. War, however, is an inescapable irreversible situation. War is horror and is the reality this study is dodging. Instead of tackling the fundamental issues of how humanity is affected by war, blind numbers are obtained with no further details given. </p>
<p>As stated above, the horrifically (or deliberately?) incomplete study goes on to suggest, without really stating it directly, that going to war to kill innocent people in a bankers’ wars and sticking to your full-time duty in the military will actually decrease your risk of suicide threefold! </p>

<p>This is the work of the military industrial complex. The same military industrial complex that hires CIA asset trolls online to suggest that all the atmospheric spraying programs are just “contrails” and the climate is being destroyed by the little people and not the military themselves. Now they are practically telling us that war is good for you. What will they tell us next? </p>
<p>Sadly and unfortunately this is all part of the further dumbing down of our generation by dumbing down the thinkers. This is just another step forward in the Orwellian world we live in. We are literally surround by stupid zombies who believe anything they read from a military, Department of Defense paid off shill/researcher. They will print anything they need to print to pave the road for the new world order. </p>
<p>Anyone who needs convincing from a government-paid junk scientist to tell them that going to war is NOT linked to suicide deserves whatever that empire has in store for them. </p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/familysurvivalsystem.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-2dxSSyJSY-M/UnqDDNjqNaI/AAAAAAAAV7s/GmrEINt_kNM/s220/imgad.jpg"></a>I urge readers not to fall for this political propaganda. This “study” is very likely being published due to a decrease in military recruit signup. Perhaps too many Americans are waking up and saying no to the evil oppressive and deceptive military whose only mission today is to fight the bankers’ wars of aggression. We’ve reached a point in history unfortunately where all honor in the military is lost. The only thing the U.S. military lives off of now is pure deception, advertising, sensationalism and propaganda. </p>
<p>Is there anyone who still believes the U.S. military is fighting for “freedom”?? Let’s brush off government-sponsored pro-military scientific claims and stay focused on the basic truths about who we are. Humans are on earth to thrive, and you cannot thrive if you are subjected to the horrors of war. Realize that war is unnatural and humans were never meant to be subjected to this experience. Even more important, realize that all wars are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1Qt6a-vaNM">bankers’ wars</a> and you might be the “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uR5p09NTrkg">dumb stupid animals</a>” they need to die for them. </p>
<p>So the next time you come across government-sponsored propaganda studies try to recognize the format they use. Look for the predetermined result that fits their agenda perfectly, notice who is funding and conducting the study, and remember this is the same blueprint pharmaceutical companies use to endorse their own studies to guarantee mega profits. The political and for-profit “scientific research” blueprint is a very common one and it’s being used all the time by the controllers – it’s up to you to recognize it. One must be able to resist the aura that comes with the word “published.” It’s all part of the long-planned propaganda for enslavement of your mind. </p>
<p><i>Bernie is a revolutionary writer with a background in medicine,  psychology, and information technology. He has written numerous articles  over the years about freedom, government corruption and conspiracies,  and solutions. A former host of the 9/11 Freefall radio show, Bernie is  also the creator of the <a href="http://truthandarttv.com/">Truth and Art TV</a>  project where he shares articles and videos about issues that raise our  consciousness and offer solutions to our current problems. His efforts  are designed to encourage others to joyfully stand for truth, to expose  government tactics of propaganda, fear and deception, and to address the  psychology of dealing with the rising new world order. He is also a  former U.S. Marine who believes it is our duty to stand for and defend  the U.S. Constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic. A peace  activist, he believes information and awareness is the first step toward  being free from enslavement from the globalist control system which now  threatens humanity. He believes love conquers all fear and it is up to  each and every one of us to manifest the solutions and the change that  you want to see in this world, because doing this is the very thing that  will ensure victory and restoration of the human race from the rising  global enslavement system, and will offer hope to future generations.  </i></p>

<p>Because the people responsible for today’s New Manhattan Project are mass murdering and wrecking the environment, they feel a need to cover it up. They go about trying to firstly make the public believe that this is not happening and secondly, if it was, that it would be justified. Over the years, in order to maintain their façades, they have produced and maintained an incredibly huge and well oiled disinformation apparatus. The group most probably responsible for this apparatus is the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).</p>
<p>This paper examines the historical and ongoing psychological warfare campaign lodged against the American people designed to simultaneously occlude and legitimize the New Manhattan Project. This paper examines the New Manhattan Project’s information war.</p>
<p>If you do not know what the New Manhattan Project is, please refer to the author’s previous article <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2015/02/chemtrails-exposed-history-of-new.html">“Chemtrails Exposed: A History of the New Manhattan Project.”</a></p>
<h3>A history of deception</h3>
<p>The New Manhattan Project is built upon a foundation of lies; chief among them is the theory of man-made global warming. Large-scale fear mongering about an out-of-control climate goes back to 1965 and has served as the rationalization for this global weather control project. The origins of the theory of anthropogenic (man-made) global warming are the origins of this coordinated disinformation campaign.</p>
<p>The first high-level document to assert the modern theory of man-made global warming was a little something called “Restoring the Quality of Our Environment.” This Orwellian 1965 report, written by the Environmental Pollution Panel of the President’s Science Advisory Committee, explains how CO2 emitted by man is causing global warming and therefore we may need to inject small particles into the atmosphere in order to cool the planet. Injecting small particles into the atmosphere to cool the planet is today’s Solar Radiation Management (SRM) geoengineering thesis. This is the thesis that calls for spraying toxic chemicals from airplanes. The document reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The climatic changes that may be produced by the increased CO2 content could be deleterious from the point of view of human beings. The possibilities of deliberately bringing about countervailing climatic changes therefore need to be thoroughly explored. A change in the radiation balance in the opposite direction to that which might result from the increase of atmospheric CO2 could be produced by raising the albedo, or reflectivity, of the earth. Such a change in albedo could be brought about, for example by spreading very small reflecting particles over large oceanic areas. The particles should be sufficiently buoyant so that they will remain close to the sea surface and they should have a high reflectivity, so that even a partial covering of the surface would be adequate to produce a marked change in the amount of reflected sunlight. Rough estimates indicate that enough particles partially to cover a square mile could be produced for for perhaps one hundred dollars. Thus a 1% change in reflectivity might be brought about for about 500 million dollars a year, particularly if the reflecting particles were spread in low latitudes, where the incoming radiation is concentrated. Considering the extraordinary economic and human importance of climate, costs of this magnitude do not seem excessive. An early development of the needed technology might have other uses, for example in inhibiting the formation of hurricanes in tropical oceanic areas.</p>
<p>According to Manabe and Strickler (1964) the absorption and re-radiation of infrared by high cirrus clouds (above five miles) tends to heat the atmosphere near the earth’s surface. Under some circumstances, injection of condensation or freezing nuclei will cause cirrus clouds to form at high altitudes. This potential method of bringing about climatic changes needs to be investigated as a possible tool for modifying atmospheric circulation in ways which might counteract the effects of increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/droughtusa.html" rel="nofollow"><img class="alignright" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-NOmIo5IQJQ4/Vlst70S58KI/AAAAAAAACE4/8Ocr-GMmY6I/s250-Ic42/water4.jpg" alt=""></a>Note how at the end of the first paragraph, the authors state that injecting small particles into the atmosphere can not only save us from global warming, but also achieve weather modification. The truth is softly spoken.</p>
<p>To this day, the theory of man-made global warming is being used as the rationalization for SRM geoengineering programs. It is being used as the rationalization for spraying stuff out of airplanes. Once this simple deception was established, the information war began.</p>
<p>Two years later, in the pages of the 1967 National Science Foundation’s ninth annual weather modification report, we find an early example. It reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ESSA [Environmental Science Services Administration] is also investigating the effect of cirrus clouds on the radiation budget of the atmosphere by studying aircraft-produced contrails which often spread into cirrus layers covering considerable fractions of the sky. One technique proposed for modifying lower cloud development has been the generation of a high level cirrus deck with jet aircraft. By intercepting solar radiation at high altitude it may be possible to influence larger scale cloud development elsewhere by reducing solar input and reducing convective cloud generation in areas where they are not needed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note how the authors of this report misrepresent chemtrails as contrails. Before 1967, the National Science Foundation (NSF) was not saying this. This is a psychological warfare tactic. They are trying to make us believe that an apple is an orange. If a lie is repeated often enough and with enough conviction, people will believe it. This is what the authors of this passage are counting on. As we will see, this lie has been repeated <em>ad nauseam</em>. ESSA is the predecessor to today’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).</p>
<p>A little later in that same NSF report, it reads that their computer atmospheric simulations, or “models” as they call them, might simulate, “…producing high-level cirrus cloud cover over an area by means of jet aircraft, inserting particulate matter into the upper atmosphere to alter the solar radiation balance and the like.”</p>
<p>A 1970 paper, again originating from the Environmental Science Services Administration (ESSA), provided another early example. The author, P.M. Kuhn writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The spreading out of jet contrails into extensive cirrus sheets is a familiar sight. In the most common case, when persistent conditions exist from twenty-five to forty thousand feet, a few long contrails increase in number and gradually merge into an almost solid white sheet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Kuhn continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From a descriptive point of view contrail development and spreading commonly begins in the morning hours as heavy jet traffic commences and finally extends from horizon to horizon as the air traffic peaks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Conveniently for Mr. Kuhn, this paper was not peer reviewed or refereed.</p>
<p>Even though our military’s use of weather modification to flood out the enemy’s main supply route in Vietnam has since been declassified, the Secretary of Defense swore that he knew otherwise. In other words, he lied about it. Let us reference a brief passage from the 1978 Congressional Research Service report:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>During an April 1972 appearance before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Secretary of Defense Laird was questioned by both Senator Pell and Senator Fullbright about rainmaking in Vietnam. The Secretary said: ‘We have never engaged in that type of activity over North Vietnam.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1977 the Weather Modification Advisory Board expounded upon a familiar line of bull. Their authors wrote, “Introducing contrails in selective regions of the atmosphere can produce cirrus clouds, to keep heat in or out of an area.” 1977 was also the year that the term “geoengineering” was introduced in the premiere edition of the journal <em>Climatic Change</em>. The late 1970s was when today’s SRM geoengineering thesis began taking a firm foothold.</p>
<p>In 1987, the World Meteorological Organization and the British Royal Air Force cast this self-explanatory abomination out upon the Earth:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Chemtrails-as-contrails-by-the-WMO-and-RAF.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-121599"></a><em>Chemtrails presented as contrails by the WMO and the Royal Air Force</em><br />
<em> Image source: the World Meteorological Organization &amp; the British Royal Air Force</em></p>
<p>A 1999 report by the United Nations’ World Meteorological Organization and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change titled “Aviation and the Global Atmosphere” bolstered lies about contrails by stating that they can form cirrus clouds.</p>
<p>In 2000, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) along with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), NOAA, and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) compromised themselves by releasing a report titled “EPA Aircraft Contrails Factsheet.” In this report, they tell lies about how contrails, “…last for hours while growing to several kilometers in width and 200 to 400 meters in height.” This report included the image below, of course, informing us that the emissions pictured consist only of harmless water vapor.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/EPA_Aircraft_Contrails_Factsheet_chemtrails.png" rel="attachment wp-att-121601"></a><em>Chemtrails presented as contrails in the EPA factsheet</em><br />
<em> Image source: the Environmental Protection Agency</em></p>
<p>A 2001 paper appearing in the <em>Journal of Geophysical Research</em> says that “contrail clusters” cause radiative forcing (the SRM geoengineering thesis) and, “…mature into diffuse cloudiness.” The authors write:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Clusters of spreading, persistent contrails sometimes form in heavy air-traffic regions when the warm exhaust emissions from subsonic jet aircraft mix with cold and relatively moist ambient air in the upper troposphere. Time series of satellite imagery have shown that these clusters can develop into large regions of cirrus-like cloudiness [Minnis et al., 1998a], which may affect climate by modifying the atmospheric radiative budget. As contrails are ice clouds, they have radiative effects that are similar to thin cirrus clouds [Fu and Liou, 1993] and may have significant regional climatic impacts [Liou et al., 1990].</p>

This is from the same government that in 2009 proposed SRM geoengineering and in 2010 produced a joint report with the U.S. House of Representatives advocating geoengineering regulation.</p>
<p>NASA has a web page dedicated to brainwashing children. At the top of the page it reads, “Contrail Watching for Kids.” Alongside a picture of a chemtrail-laden sky, the text reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Contrails are long clouds made by high-flying aircraft. Because kids are so good at watching clouds, they can easily be taught to identify contrails.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is enough to make one a little nauseous, isn’t it? They’re coming for our kids. For those with strong stomachs, here is the <a href="http://mynasadata.larc.nasa.gov/science_projects/contrail-watching-for-kids/">link</a>.</p>
<p>Our friends at NASA were providing disinformation once again when they presented the image below with a caption that described the many chemtrails as, “…contrails, cirrus clouds created by airplanes.” They must think that we are too ignorant and stupid to realize that these lines in the sky are not following routine flight paths.</p>

<h3>Chemtrails in media</h3>
<p>Since the 1946 media explosion celebrating the pioneering weather modification efforts of three General Electric scientists, airplanes spraying stuff have made regular mainstream media appearances. Today, the persistent lines in the sky left behind by airplanes are woven into the mainstream media’s fabric. What is presented here is but a small sampling.</p>
<p>The 1959 Disney short educational film <em>Eyes in Outer Space: A Science-factual Presentation</em> was made in cooperation with the Department of Defense. The famous conventional weather modifier Irving P. Krick served as a technical consultant. This movie depicts men in <del>Lawrence Livermore National Labs</del> a global weather center controlling the weather with drone aircraft. As a plane flies across the screen emitting a trail, the narrator says, “Robot planes seed the clouds from above.” These “robot planes” are then depicted saving us all from a nasty hurricane by spraying stuff into it. Here is an edited version:</p>

<p>The back of the chemtrails card reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>CHEMTRAILS – THOSE BILLOWING WATER VAPOR STREAMS BEHIND AN AIRPLANE – ARE ACTUALLY BIOLOGICAL AGENTS BEING DISPERSED BY VARIOUS GOVERNMENTS FOR UNDISCLOSED REASONS (POSSIBLY MIND OR POPULATION CONTROL). AT LEAST THAT’S THE ALLEGATION BY CONSPIRACY THEORISTS.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A Sept. 24, 2013 <em>Guardian</em> article about geoengineering featured a photo of one of the observable effects of today’s chemtrail spraying operations; a sun dog. They may as well have presented a photograph of chemtrails criss-crossing the sky.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/why_geoengineering_suits_Russias_carbon_agenda.png" rel="attachment wp-att-121608"></a><em>A Guardian geoengineering article</em><br />

<p>The February 22, 2016 episode of <em>The X-Files</em> titled “My Struggle II” featured a storyline involving an outbreak of a mass pandemic caused by chemtrails combined with microwave electromagnetic energy.</p>
<p>Chemtrails are consistently appearing in all types of advertisements. GeoengineeringWatch.org has a good article about it <a href="http://www.geoengineeringwatch.org/chemtrails-in-advertisement-and-media-everywhere-why/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Chemtrails have been drawn into video games. Here are a couple of examples; one from a Lego video game and another from <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>:</p>

<p>Our armed services are also getting in on the act. Here is a webpage from the Office of Naval Research depicting chemtrails:</p>

<p>It figures. Because Navy research has been instrumental in the development of technologies used in today’s New Manhattan Project and is probably to this day involved.</p>
<h3>Controlling the narrative</h3>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/backyardliberty.html" rel="nofollow"><img class="alignright" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ONE8Lk_RzR8/UjeZnRyZRTI/AAAAAAAAVJw/TMNS4NzHKZo/s220/BL_158220.gif" alt=""></a>In the first section, we saw many lies coming, in a one way conversation, from the establishment. The advent of the Internet has created a new dynamic, though. Now the average citizen gets to talk back. For when this talkback disagrees with the establishment position, new ways of squelching dissent have been developed.</p>
<p>President Obama’s former administrator of the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Cass R. Sunstein co-wrote a 2008 paper titled “Conspiracy Theories.” Referring to theories about the 9/11 attacks, global warming, the Apollo moon missions, and many others, Sunstein and his co-author wrote that conspiracy theories can be very dangerous and must be dealt with. In stead of outright censorship, the co-authors opted for cognitive infiltration; a.k.a. psychological warfare. The authors write:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Government agents (and their allies) might enter chat rooms, online social networks, or even real-space groups and attempt to undermine percolating conspiracy theories by raising doubts about their factual premises, causal logic or implications for political action.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let us not forget that our federal government’s official position is that chemtrails do not exist and that the New Manhattan Project is a conspiracy theory.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Cass-Sunstein.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-121613"></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Cass Sunstein</em><br />
<em> Image source: unknown</em></p>
<p>A series of 2014 articles by Glenn Greenwald and others revealed documents, procured by Edward Snowden, showing how the British Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) has been running Internet psychological warfare operations against American citizens. The outward manifestation of these operations are the myriad of disinformation artists which almost always (sometimes immediately) pop up when anyone dares question the persistent trails in the sky or anything else the establishment doesn’t want you to know about.</p>
<p>“Sock puppets” (also known as “shills” and “trolls”) are the dastardly and diabolical creatures that almost invariably crawl out of the Internet’s woodwork when one asserts that chemtrails are real. They have many different modes of operation and infest comments sections, forums, and disinformation websites. Many or most are probably computers; i.e. artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Although trolls employ many tactics, the most prevalent involve attempts to discredit sources and information. Incessant attacks upon an individual’s or organization’s character and credibility are used when the quality of the information coming from either cannot be impugned. The thinking goes that if one can discredit the source, than any other information produced by that source is also invalid; even if the other information produced by that source is unassailable. Trolls also build “straw men” in attempts to discredit information. A straw man is built by picking out a small aspect of a larger body of information and attempting to discredit that particular little bit. The thinking goes that if one small part of a larger body of information can be discredited, than all of the larger body is also discredited.</p>
<p>Many trolls are not Human at all. Way back in the early 1970s, people were communicating with computers. Not only that, but computer scientists at Stanford and UCLA were conducting wholly computerized correspondence between two computers over the ARPANET (the precursor to today’s Internet). Today, this technology is commonplace. To have “bots” automatically responding is probably simple and cost-effective; therefore desirable and prevalent. The robotic manner in which computerized sock puppets respond often reveals their hand.</p>
<p>In February of this year (2016), Infowars published an article titled “Backing Infowars May Soon Be Considered ‘Material Support’ of Terrorism.” In this article, Kurt Nimmo outlines the U.S. government’s latest moves to crack down on those who dare to criticize our federal gods. Here is a <a href="http://www.infowars.com/backing-infowars-may-soon-be-considered-material-support-of-terrorism/">link</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/patriotprivacy.html"><img class="alignleft" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-87TN97qvUkI/Vglq4samFUI/AAAAAAAACBo/3KM84rzs47g/s250-Ic42/Eyeball-ad-300x2501-300x250.png" alt=""></a>This is quite chilling when considering that your author has been compared to the “domestic terrorists” hereby singled-out. In a March 14, 2015 article, the <em>Christian Science Monitor</em> (of all outlets) published a piece titled “EPA Debunks ‘Chemtrails,’ Further Fueling Conspiracy Theories.” Here is a <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2015/0314/EPA-debunks-chemtrails-further-fueling-conspiracy-theories-video">link</a>.</p>
<p>In this article, even though I have no criminal record, your author is compared to a married couple named Jerad and Amanda Miller who shot and killed three people including two police officers at a Las Vegas Wal-Mart before being killed themselves. This is a classic attempt to discredit the source and possibly set him up. That’s not very Christian of them now, is it?</p>
<h3>The CIA</h3>
<p>It is probably the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) running the New Manhattan Project’s cover. They have been there since the beginning. The CIA’s involvement in the world’s media is well documented. They have been domestically targeting American citizens. They have a history of climate change research and related fear mongering. Not only all that, but the CIA has owned, operated, and provided cover for large, clandestine aircraft operations involving weather modification.</p>
<p>In a previous article titled <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2015/04/death-from-above-new-manhattan-project.html">“Death from Above: The New Manhattan Project Chemtrail Fleet,”</a> the author documented some of the CIA’s proprietary airlines; chief among them Air America.</p>
<p>As recounted in the article, Chris Robbins’ book <em>Air America</em> documents a CIA proprietary airline, Civil Air Transport, conducting weather modification operations. <em>Air America</em> also describes how the CIA provided cover for their proprietary airlines by producing untraceable aircraft. These skills would come in handy when providing cover for the hundreds of aircraft necessarily involved in today’s New Manhattan Project.</p>
<p>At least one of the co-authors of the aforementioned 1965 White House document establishing both the theory of man-made global warming and today’s Solar Radiation Management (SRM) geoengineering theses had connections to the CIA. That co-author was none other than our good friend Gordon J.F. “How to Wreck the Environment” MacDonald. His National Academy of Sciences obituary reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gordon chaired the MEDEA Committee (initially the Environmental Task Force) of the Central Intelligence Agency, a brainchild of Senator (later Vice-President) Gore for the application of ‘overhead assets,’ that is, information collected by intelligence satellites, to the solution of environmental problems. Here the intelligence and academic communities, two disparate communities meeting initially under conditions of mutual mistrust, developed over the years a feeling of trust and respect. Gordon was at his best, combining his unique environmental background with patience and perseverance. In 1994 the CIA presented Gordon with the Seal Medallion, the highest civilian honor of the agency.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As if we could forget, Al Gore has been the most prominent proponent of the theory of man-made global warming and how we need to sacrifice our quality of life because of it.</p>
<p>This information suggests that MacDonald was instrumental in the development of the New Manhattan Project’s satellite remote sensing needs. For more about the NMP’s satellite remote sensing operations, please see the author’s previous article <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2015/10/c4-command-control-communications-and-computers-of-the-new-manhattan-chemtrail-project.html">“C4: Command, Control, Communications, and Computers of the New Manhattan Chemtrail Project.”</a></p>
<p>For more about the infamous Gordon J.F., please see the author’s previous article <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2015/11/mitre-architects-of-the-new-manhattan-chemtrail-project.html">“MITRE: Architects of the New Manhattan Chemtrail Project?”</a></p>
<p>The CIA’s MEDEA (Measurements of Earth Data for Environmental Analysis) Committee, of which Mr. MacDonald was a member, existed from 1992-2001. According to a Jan. 4, 2010 <em>New York Times</em> article, the MEDEA Committee was resurrected as a CIA backed, National Academy of Sciences run environmental remote sensing program. Five years later, the <em>Washington Times</em> and <em>Mother Jones</em> reported that this program had, once again, been shut down.</p>
<p>The CIA has been commanding the mainstream media for a long time. Operation Mockingbird is a CIA program that began in the late 1940s as a way to influence foreign populations. It has since been turned upon the domestic American population. The operation was initially overseen by Allen Dulles and we have no reason to believe that it does not continue to this day.</p>
<p>Former <em>Village Voice</em> reporter Deborah Davis quoted a CIA analyst when she reported that, in the early 1950s, the CIA, through Operation Mockingbird “owned” 400-600 journalists at <em>The New York Times</em>, <em>Newsweek</em>, <em>CBS</em>, and other organizations. Of course, the foreign operations thundered along as well.</p>
<p>The CIA exerts extraordinary influence over the press. In his meticulously researched book <a class="easyazon-link" href="https://www.activistpost.com/product/B00PSSDNKS/US/permacultucom-20/?cart=y" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Virtual Government: CIA Mind Control Operations in America</em></a>, Alex Constantine writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The cost of disinforming the world cost American taxpayers an estimated $265 million a year by 1978, a budget larger than the combined expenditures of Reuters, UPI and the AP news syndicates. In 1977, the New York Times ran a front-page story detailing a worldwide propaganda effort, with direct CIA ownership of some 50 newspapers in the U.S. and elsewhere.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this next passage from<em> Virtual Government</em>, we see similar disinformation tactics as those outlined in the previous section. Mr. Constantine writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One CIA dispatch, dated April 1, 1967, declassified nine years later under FOIA [Freedom of Information Act], advised planted ‘assets’ in the media on ‘Countering Criticism of the Warren Report.’ Features and book reviews ‘are particularly appropriate for this purpose,’ the CIA dispatch observed. Strategies to ‘answer and refute’ critics of the government’s investigation of the JFK murder included accusations that they were ‘financially interested,’ ‘hasty and inaccurate in their research,’ ‘infatuated with their own theories,’ and ‘wedded to theories adopted before the evidence was in.’ The CIA’s mouthpieces in the press were directed to emphasize: ‘No significant new evidence has emerged,’ ‘there is no agreement among the critics,’ or the ever-popular, ‘Conspiracy on the large scale often suggested would be impossible to conceal.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As they attempt to throw us off the scent of today’s New Manhattan Project, chemtrail shills follow these same directives.</p>
<p>Pulitzer Prize winner Carl Bernstein wrote a 1977 article titled “The CIA and the Media” supporting Constantine’s findings. Here is <a href="http://www.carlbernstein.com/magazine_cia_and_media.php">a link</a> to Bernstein’s complete article.</p>
<p>David Rockefeller was apparently talking about the CIA’s media operations when, at a 1991 Bilderberg meeting, he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are grateful to the Washington Post, the New York Times, Time Magazine and other great publications whose directors have attended our meetings and respected their promises of discretion for almost 40 years……It would have been impossible for us to develop our plan for the world if we had been subjected to the lights of publicity during those years. But, the world is more sophisticated and prepared to march towards a world government. The supranational sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers is surely preferable to the national auto-determination practiced in past centuries.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Evidence exists that the CIA’s activities in this area continue to this day. Respected German journalist Udo Ulfkotte PhD was interviewed in 2014 saying that he got tired of publishing articles under his name, written by CIA agents. He wrote a book about it titled <em>Gekaufte Journalisten</em> (Bought Journalists). An English version of his book with the title of <em>Journalists for Hire: How the CIA Buys the News</em> is scheduled for June 1, 2016. One can pre-order a copy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Journalists-Hire-How-Buys-News/dp/1944505458/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1457214851&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Udo+Ulfkotte">here</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/spybook.html" rel="nofollow"><img class="alignright" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-JeqDJzSCYv8/VmRku1KQXjI/AAAAAAAACHc/85aA1BGDXlA/s250-Ic42/LFL_SPY_HumanLieDetector_250x250.jpg" alt=""></a>Not only have they been running the media, but the CIA has been promoting paranoia about the Earth’s temperature for a long time. The 1974, CIA produced report titled “A Study of Climatological Research as it Pertains to Intelligence Problems” fear mongers incessantly about climate fluctuations and weather. They report on recent examples of extreme weather and the resultant death and destruction as evidence for a long-term shift in Earth’s climate which they call “the climate change.” Maybe they should have made a horror movie by that title.</p>
<p>The authors of “A Study of Climatological Research” go on to state that the combination of “the climate change” and Earth’s growing Human population is a recipe for disaster. They write that the crop failures due to “the climate change” are destabilizing governments all over the world. They write that destabilization of governments can cause war. The authors write:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Timely forecasting of climate and its impact on any nation is vital to the planning and execution of U.S. policy on social, economic, and political issues. The new climatic era brings a promise of famine and starvation to many areas of the world. The resultant unrest caused by the mass movement of peoples across borders as well as the attendant intelligence questions cannot be met with existing analytical tools. In addition, the Agency will be faced with tracing and anticipating climate modification undertaken by a country to relieve its own situation at the detriment of the United States. The implication of such a modification must be carefully assessed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You guessed it. They need more funding.</p>
<p>This report appears to be the fount of the wildly reaching assumptions pervasive among global warming alarmists today claiming: famine, disease, mass-migrations, war and Humanity’s extinction all due to global warming.</p>
<p>A small problem for today’s global warming cult members, though, is the fact that this early example of climate change delusion concerned itself with global cooling, not global warming. If one tries hard enough, anything can be made to appear as a problem.</p>
<p>In 2008, the CIA contributed to a standard global warming scare-fest titled “National Intelligence Assessment on the National Security Implications of Global Climate Change to 2030.” At least this time the authors of the report didn’t foresee state failure. We have something to be thankful for.</p>
<p>In 2015, <em>CNS News</em> and <em>Mother Jones</em> reported that CIA director John Brennan was regurgitating nonsense about all the impending doom sure to come from Earth’s temperature fluctuations and how he is so concerned. He really cares so much. He probably got to the top of the CIA by being such a caring individual.</p>
<p>Lastly, the CIA, funded a study resulting in the 2015 National Academy of Sciences report titled “Climate Intervention: Reflecting Sunlight to Cool Earth.” This study was also supported by some of the usual suspects: the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the Department of Energy.</p>
<p>In “Climate Intervention” the authors cite the discredited Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) data to assert that global waring is occurring. Then they write that the topic of SRM geoengineering needs more research and, without admitting that anything like it is currently taking place, they present SRM geoengineering as a potential solution. If one has read scores of these types of documents, one recognizes this standard line of bull immediately.</p>
<h3>Notable people &amp; organizations speaking out</h3>
<p>We are not alone. Not everyone works for the CIA. Millions of people worldwide are fully chemtrail aware and speaking out. Many other, more influential individuals have voiced concern and taken action as well. Along with some government and other organizations, at least scores of famous and notable people have been speaking out against chemtrails and geoengineering. The examples listed here are undoubtedly a partial list.</p>
<p>Ted Gunderson (1928-2011), the former head of the Los Angeles, Dallas and Memphis FBI claims to have witnessed huge, unmarked chemtrail spraying planes on the ground at the Lincoln, Nebraska Air National Guard facilities. He also said that chemtrail spraying planes operate out of Fort Sill, Oklahoma.</p>
<p>U.S. congressman Dennis Kucinich used the word “chemtrails” in proposed national legislation. The word appeared in the “Space Preservation Act of 2001.” The National legislation did not pass, but on September 10, 2002 the City Council of Berkeley, California, in support of Congressman Kucinich’s Space Preservation Act, enacted Resolution #61744 declaring the space 60 kilometers and above Berkeley as a space-based weapons-free zone. On September 14th, Congressman Kucinich was officially presented the resolution by Council member Dona Spring, who initiated the resolution before 700 people in Wheeler Auditorium. The audience gave Kucinich and Spring a standing ovation.</p>

<p>In 2007, Dutch parliamentarian Erik Meijer raised the issue with the European Parliament. The European Parliament of course responded that contrails persist and that chemtrails do not exist.</p>
<p>There has been formal discussion of chemtrails in the New Zealand Parliament.</p>
<p>Former Canadian Prime Minister (1986-1991) Bill Vander Zalm has repeatedly spoken out against chemtrails.</p>
<p>Multi-term Arizona state senator Karen Johnson has been an outspoken critic.</p>
<p>A former member of the United States Air Force has testified to the fact that strange materials were being brought on base presumably for the replenishment of chemtrail spraying airplanes. Kristen Meghan’s job at Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma was to monitor all materials coming in and going out. She says that anomalous containers coming on base contained the main chemtrail ingredients: aluminum, barium and strontium.</p>
<p>In 2012, former Georgia congresswoman Cynthia McKinney spoke out. Here is a video:</p>

<p>On July 3, 2013, Arizona state senator Sylvia Allen posted a note on her Facebook page indicating that she thinks for herself. She is a very dangerous woman. Here is a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sylvia.t.allen/posts/622863927737785">link</a>.</p>
<p>In October of 2013, a Canadian MP by the name of Alex Atamanenko presented to the Canadian parliament a petition signed by over 1,000 people outlining concerns about chemtrails.</p>
<p>On June 25, 2014 the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality held a public hearing about geoengineering and chemtrails. The meeting was sponsored by state Senator Kelli Ward.</p>
<p>At an August 5, 2014 meeting of the Shasta County, CA board of supervisors, chemtrails were on the agenda. 300 people attended. Dozens testified. The supervisors voted to open an investigation into chemtrails and geoengineering and to send their findings to appropriate government agencies.</p>
<p>Former Marin County Board of Supervisors, District 1 Representative Susan Adams has voiced interest in chemtrail legislation, stating,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I will continue to monitor your efforts and if there is federal legislation or regulation being considered which the county can send a letter of support for, please let me know.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eleventh Senatorial District California state Senator Mark Leno recognizes chemtrails. He responded to my letter about chemtrails by stating,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thank you for writing to share the information on chemtrails. I appreciate your taking the time to voice your concerns regarding this important issue. As we begin to learn more about chemtrails and begin to have more in depth conversations about their use, I will keep the information you have forwarded in mind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A Dec., 2014 video published by Dane Wigington titled “Geoengineering Dangers Discussed by Officials, Agency Scientists and Other Experts” provides a wealth of information.</p>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daGuPLXVunQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daGuPLXVunQ</a></p>
<p>In this video, among other speakers, we hear from a former American Airlines commercial airline pilot by the name of Jeff Nelson who testifies to the fact that jet airplane exhaust does not persist. He says that contrails dissipate quickly. That means that these lines in the sky, often stretching from horizon to horizon, are not normal contrails. Also in the video, a Shasta County, CA supervisor by the name of Bill Schappell recognizes geoengineering as an ongoing, secret operation.</p>
<p>On May 19, 2015 the City of Richmond, CA adopted a resolution in support of the Space Preservation Act and the Space Preservation Treaty to symbolically ban “space-based weapons.” The Space Preservation Act is the previously noted 2001 Kucinich sponsored federal legislation which used the word “chemtrail.”</p>
<p>In December of 2015, a member of the Saudi royal family, Princess Basmah Bint Saud <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2015/12/saudi-princess-speaks-out-against-chemtrails-and-geoengineering.html">went public with her concerns</a>.</p>
<p>A North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) commander by the name of Fabio Mini and a member of the Italian parliament by the name of Sandro Brandini have gone public. Russia Today and Geoengineering Watch come through with the video:</p>

<p>The Cypriot government is taking action. Due to many complaints, Agriculture Minister Kouyialis <a href="http://in-cyprus.com/minister-to-probe-mysterious-chemtrails/">has ordered an official investigation</a>.</p>
<p>The Rhode Island house of representatives is currently considering a bill titled “The Climate Geoengineering Act of 2016.” If passed, this bill will outlaw SRM geoengineering over the state of Rhode Island and provide penalties for violations. Along with links to the bill itself, Geoengineering Watch has all the latest information <a href="http://www.geoengineeringwatch.org/anti-geoengineering-legislation-in-rhode-island-still-alive/">here</a>:</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Quite a few famous musicians have spoken out. Beck released a 2008 song titled “Chemtrails.” The lyrics read like this:</p>
<p><em>So many people</em><br />
<em> Where do they go?</em><br />
<em> You and me watching a sky full of chemtrails</em><br />
<em> Watching the jet planes go by</em></p>
<p>In 2009, musician Prince spoke out about chemtrails on the <em>Tavis Smiley Show</em>.</p>

<p>In 2010, Billy Corgan of the Smashing Pumpkins took time out from one of his live performances to point out the “toxic death smoke” in the sky. Here is the video:</p>

<p>In a 2011 song titled “What I Hate,” country music legend Merle Haggard sings, “What I hate is looking up and seeing chemtrails in a clear blue sky today.” The song is available on YouTube:</p>

<p>The rock and roll band Cake is apparently chemtrail aware. Lyrics from multiple songs indicate awareness. Their 2001 song “Comfort Eagle” goes like this:</p>
<p><em>And the fluffy white lines</em><br />
<em> That the airplane leaves behind</em><br />
<em> Are drifting right in front</em><br />
<em> Of the waning of the moon</em></p>
<p>Their 2004 ditty “Wheels” informs us:</p>
<p><em>In a wooden boat in the shipping lanes</em><br />
<em> With the freighters towering over me</em><br />
<em> I can hear the jets flying overhead</em><br />
<em> Making lines across the darkening sky</em></p>
<p>Lastly, Cake’s 2011 release “Easy to Crash” states:</p>
<p><em>Clouds hung hugely and oppressively</em><br />
<em> Over our busy little cars</em><br />
<em> Clouds hung hugely and oppressively</em><br />
<em> We didn’t notice</em><br />
<em> We didn’t care</em><br />
<em> We didn’t notice</em></p>

<p>A shill online once challenged your author to find any doctors or PhDs who have spoken out against chemtrails and geoengineering. At the time, I really wasn’t aware of any. Since that fateful day, I have been compiling a list. To whomever that pathetic creature was: thank you for making us stronger. With plenty more on the way, here is the list:</p>

<p>Let history remember the people who had enough common sense to recognize the obvious and enough guts to tell the truth. When the New Manhattan Project is dead and gone, let the people who spoke out against it prosper.</p>
<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<p>If you’ve ever wondered from whence the theory of man-made global warming came, then wonder no more. The theory of man-made global warming was invented and has been perpetuated as a cover story for the New Manhattan Project.</p>
<p>Let that sink in real good. You heard it here first, folks. All the lies told by all the medias and all the governments of the world pertaining to global warming are cover for the greatest scientific endeavor in Human history. The first planetary level scientific endeavor is so huge that it needs a cover story this big. Many socio-economic agendas like the United Nations’ Agenda 21 and cap-and-trade have been piggybacked upon it, but the original impetus for the lie is the New Manhattan Project.</p>
<p>In 1965, when traitorous and illegitimate elements of our federal government released the document titled “Restoring the Quality of Our Environment,” simultaneously establishing both the theory of man-made global warming and the SRM geoengineering theses, that was the beginning of the lie. This lie about global warming served and serves as the justification for spraying megatons of toxic garbage over Humanity and the Earth’s biota. This lie was needed as justification for the visible aspects of the planned New Manhattan Project.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/batteries.html" rel="nofollow"><img class="alignright" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-mK-Y3O_XqFg/VgA9hfoAr6I/AAAAAAAAB80/Ts6d9cOcWDI/s220-Ic42/250x250.png" alt=""></a>Let us not forget that the above noted document came out of the executive branch of the federal government and that the CIA is designed to serve the executive branch. In the New Manhattan Project, this article you are reading has shown the CIA’s pervasive involvement. The CIA probably concocted the theory of man-made global warming.</p>
<p>Consider the implications of this. Consider how almost all of the environmental movements and organizations in the Western world have been folded into this grand deception. Consider the countless millions of people who have marched in the street, in a satanic orgy, demanding the Earth’s (and their own) destruction. Consider all the money that has been donated to perpetuate this treachery. Consider all the fools who have forsaken and attacked their fellow man because he did not want to be destroyed. The establishment has had all these people thinking that they are doing a good turn, all the while these people have been supporting everybody’s and everything’s utter destruction. In the church of global warming, there is an altar beneath the pulpit.</p>
<p>If you still espouse the theory of man-made global warming, and are not completely nihilistic and selfish, please relinquish your dogma. We’re all being murdered and most of us really don’t want to be killed. Heck, most of us don’t even want a reduction in our quality of life. It’s not necessary. This is what happens when we let a vampire into our house. Death is what happens when enough people believe the big global warming lie.</p>

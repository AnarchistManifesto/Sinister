<p>The mission of a small “elite” group to control the masses is nothing new. It has always been a tool implemented in the form of propaganda used to alter perception and thus steer the direction of large populations. The <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2010/12/10-modern-methods-of-mind-control.html">modern methods of mind control</a> are in many ways merely higher-tech extensions of what always has been predictably successful: religion, sports, politics, education, etc.</p>
<p>With the advent of television, a whole new world was opened up for would-be controllers, as news media was easily corporatized and made uniform enough to translate core messages, while encouraging passivity, and also presenting the illusion of <i>choice</i>. Simultaneously, choice has been reduced in fundamental areas such as finance, education and health with reams of legislation and “incentives” to ensure compliance.</p>

<p>Today, however, we have entered a perilous phase where mind control has taken on a physical, scientific dimension that includes a sophisticated full-spectrum assault on the mind in the form of chemicals in the food, air, and water, as well as electromagnetic interference and the ubiquitous Big Pharma cocktail that not only pollutes the user directly, but runs off into the rest of the unknowing population. Combined with control over education and media, it’s no wonder why true rebellion struggles to take hold.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, despite the above assaults, people <i>are rebelling</i> — globally. This indicates a tentative awakening that is troubling if you are in the vast minority of those who knowingly attempt to enslave the planet. So what does tomorrow bring?<a name="more"></a>The mind control of the future forgoes all pretense at <i>indirectly </i>altering perception through media and politics, as that continues to be exposed for what it truly is. It does away with the clumsy and sporadic effectiveness of mind-altering drugs and environmental toxins, as companies like Monsanto are not only reviled, but are seen as the epitome of true evil on earth.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center"><a href="http://activistpost.net/icloak.html" target="_blank">This little device delivers turnkey Internet privacy and security (Ad)</a></h4>
<p>The mind control of the future goes straight into direct programming of the digital mind, and this is exactly what the <a class="easyazon-link" href="https://www.activistpost.com/product/0313234981/US/permacultucom-20/?cart=y" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">technotronic elite</a> are discussing right now. There are 7 likely ways this could be achieved if we don’t learn about their agenda in time to continue resisting their anti-human ends.</p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<h3><b>1. Surveillance and Gadgets</b></h3>
<p>Surveillance alone can <a href="http://www.alternet.org/news-amp-politics/surveillance-thinking-and-behavior?paging=off">change the way we think and act</a>. These two facets together are more powerful still. They have now been successfully intertwined into a <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=pogue-6-electronic-devices-you-can-control-with-your-thoughts"><i>de facto</i> brain-computer interface</a>. If we look at just two inventions — the television and video game consoles — we see a massive impact upon the way people of all ages view the world through their gadgets. In order to take people to the next level of mind control, there has to be a consumer relation to it, as well as creating something that appears intrinsically necessary to relate to the outside world. Enter the Internet and the “smart” devices wired into it. The Internet is every form of surveillance and gadget wrapped up into one. Now, even <i>that </i>is heading to the next level. It has been shown that this type of tech can <a href="http://yourlife.usatoday.com/mind-soul/story/2012-03-26/Technology-can-push-our-crazy-buttons-rewire-brains/53792424/1">rewire the brain</a>.</p>
<p>We are beginning to witness heavy investment by the twin behemoths, Google and Microsoft, in <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2012/11/google-and-microsoft-investing-in.html">“augmented reality.”</a> It is stutter-stepping to be sure based on privacy concerns, but the concept of merging reality with virtual reality has been introduced and will not likely go away. Mind-controlled computers, <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/consumer-electronics/gadgets/samsung-imagines-a-future-with-mindcontrolled-tablets">tablets</a>, phones, video games and more are <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304707604577426251091339254.html">already here</a>. The direct experience with mind/perception alteration preps the individual for this type of direct manipulation in other areas of their lives. Remember, this is a two-way street — data received and data transmitted. Combine this with the fact that every two-way action is recorded by tech companies, then fed into government databases, and we see the foundation being erected of a pyramid with a much clearer all-seeing eye than in tyrannies of even the recent past.</p>
<h3><b>2. Mind-controlled Robots and Drones</b></h3>
<p>This is already in the mainstream news, but how about the merging of man and machine? This is what <a href="http://2045.com/">the transhumanist dream</a> actually is, but DARPA is naturally looking to be sure it gets to the battlefield first. <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2011/04/masters-of-world-meet-to-play-god-with.html">The Royal Society</a>, an elite UK think-tank which will be mentioned later, has published a report that indicates an interest in using brain mapping technology to keep soldiers alert, as well as “operate weaponry remotely through mind-machine interfaces.” (<a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn21444-mind-control-could-be-future-of-warfare.html#.UcWcIPk3CtY">source</a>)With an increasing amount of <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2013/05/humans-fully-outsourced-to-robots-by.html">robots</a> and <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2013/05/database-your-face-drones-to-employ.html">drones</a> already on the battlefield and in civilian space, this opens up the possibility of <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/1741-2552/10/4/046003/article">“thought-controlled”</a> drones. The following video from a <a href="http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2013-06/thought-controlled-drone-exists-and-everything-you-need-know-about-it">PopSci article</a> shows where this is heading. After this, the question becomes whether or not <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2012/02/autonomous-drone-swarms-set-for-launch.html">autonomous drones</a> will be able to link in reverse to anyone <i>they </i>wish.</p>
<p>[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LWz4qa2XQA?feature=player_embedded]</p>
<h3><b>3. Magnetic Manipulation </b></h3>
<p>Transcranial pulsed ultrasound was made famous by The God Helmet. This is being tested in the military and begins to form the crucial bridge between “buying into it” and being <i>subjected </i>to it. Weapons are already being developed (and possibly used) that use transcranial pulse ultra sound to soldiers to increase altertness and minimize pesky emotions like fear or compassion. It turns human beings into thoughtless drones to be controlled from a distance. On the battlefield, enemies can be subjected to the opposite — lethargy, nausea, lack of impulse control, and a whole range of behavior that has no bearing upon one’s will to act otherwise. Here is a frightening description from Wired reporter Jack Hitt as his brain is magnetically manipulated to have a “religious experience.”</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>…selected electromagnetic fields begin gently thrumming my brain’s temporal lobes. The fields are no more intense than what you’d get as by-product from an ordinary blow-dryer, but what’s coming is anything but ordinary. My lobes are about to be bathed with precise wavelength patterns that are supposed to affect my mind in a stunning way, artificially inducing the sensation that I am seeing God. (<a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/7.11/persinger.html">Source</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s unlikely that only benign visions are planned for battlefield Earth. Here is a link to a .mil page discussing remote control of brain activity using ultrasound: <a href="http://science.dodlive.mil/2010/09/01/remote-control-of-brain-activity-using-ultrasound/">http://science.dodlive.mil/2010/09/01/remote-control-of-brain-activity-using-ultrasound/</a></p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>Every single aspect of human sensation, perception, emotion, and behavior is regulated by brain activity. Thus, having the ability to stimulate brain function is a powerful technology.</p>

<h3><b>4. Implants and Ingestibles</b></h3>
<p>RFID is one technology being touted as a wonder for finding lost items — like kids and dogs and products — but has also broken through into the field of medicine. Most people might want to know, for instance, if their body was registering signs of an impending upheaval at the chemical level, before it ever had time to take hold and manifest as a full-blown physical event. This plays a major role in selling the mind-body-computer connection to nearly every age. It, too, is a form of surveillance, but one that is even more salable, as there is a finer edge to this sword than straight snooping.</p>
<div>
<p>The area of mind control, aside from the obvious behavioral changes, becomes probable with RFID implants and ingestible RFID. <a href="http://www.implantable-device.com/2011/12/30/verimeds-human-implantable-verichip-patient-rfid/">VeriMed’s</a> human implant has been approved by the FDA and has been used as an ID system by the Israeli military. At the moment, this technology is being sold as an interior sensor network, but there is much more that can be done, as has been shown in animal testing. Once again, the battlefield is where it is likely to appear first in the area of neurorobotics, funded by DARPA of course, as seen in the video below:</p>
<p>[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICsQDYha63c?feature=player_detailpage]</p>
<p>One might believe this method to be a bit lower on the scale of possibility for the general public, simply because there must be a certain level of acceptance. However, with the rise of nanotechnology which can insert itself across the blood-brain barrier, it is not out of the question that the invasion could come by stealth through food or vaccines. Nanoparticles have been admitted in <a href="http://naturalsociety.com/fda-targets-nanoparticles-in-food-appliances-over-health-risks/">food, clothing and appliances</a>. Mad scientists have no idea what type of Pandora’s Box they are opening. Their only job is to open the doors and let the guinea pigs offer the results. Scientists openly have admitted to wanting to rewire the brain through DNA modification … to help us, though.</p>

<h3><b>5. Genetic and Neuroengineering</b></h3>
<p>To some, genetics form the basis of all behavior. Most would agree that it plays a role, even if a limited one that is subservient to the human will to determine behavior beyond being merely a <i>de facto</i> automaton. That isn’t stopping geneticists from attempting to determine traits, then alter or eradicate certain ones. The logical extension of this testing gets into the area of behavioral predictive programming, not only through all of the data that has been compiled on you through surveillance of your every move and expression of your every thought, but right down into the very fiber of your being. Ed Boyden from MIT’s Neuroengineering and Neuromedia Lab, explains:</p>

<h3><b>6. Neuroscience</b></h3>
<p><a href="http://www.economist.com/node/1143583">The Economist</a> noted in 2002 that this was the future of mind control; well, now we’re here. This is a huge area of research and it shows by how much is being invested, and how many federal agencies are involved.  Obama’s <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2012/02/elite-think-tanks-neuroscience-and.html">BRAIN Project</a> is heavily invested in the notion that the human brain is the final frontier. It is a comprehensive $100 million dollar 10-year plan that is already bearing some fruit. It is being announced by The Atlantic Wire that  <a href="http://m.theatlanticwire.com/technology/2013/06/google-earth-3d-brain-maps-here/66465/">The ‘Google Earth’ of 3D Brain Maps is Here</a>:</p>

<p>Once again, the promise is to solve the mysteries of diseases such as Alzheimer’s, but yet again there is DARPA to ensure that there always is underlying negative research being conducted. Memory erasure has been sought to eliminate postraumatic stress disorder, for example, which serves as a reminder of the horrors of war on <i>both </i>sides of a conflict. Multi-tour soldiers are more suicidal and homicidal than ever before and should prompt people to question the motivations for putting human beings in such a horrible state … not seeking to erase the consequences. This type of rewiring fundamentally alters what it means to be a human being capable of compassion, empathy, and free will. And, in fact, some scientists are fortunately raising the serious ethical concerns of military mind control, as documented by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mind-Wars-Science-Military-Century/dp/193413743X/ref=as_li_tf_sw?&amp;linkCode=wsw&amp;tag=natblaze-20">Jonathan Moreno</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>The military, scientists and ethicists are increasingly wondering how neuroscience technology changes the battlefield. The staggering possibilities are further along than many think. There is already development on automated drones that are programmed to make their own decisions about who to kill within the rules of war. Other ideas that are closer-than-you-think to becoming a military reality: Tanks controlled from half a world away, memory erasures that could prevent PTSD, and “brain fingerprinting” that could be used to extract secrets from enemies.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>All of those questions will have to be answered sooner than later, Moreno says, along with a host of others. Should soldiers have the right to refuse “experimental” brain implants? Will the military want to use some of this technology before science deems it safe?</p>

<p>And we never should forget that what is developed on the battlefield is sure to trickle down into the rest of society.</p>
<h3><b>7. Direct Upload/Hack</b></h3>
<p>Between the <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2012/04/cia-home-invasion-smart-tvs-and.html">Internet of Things</a> and recent revelations that reporter <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2013/06/was-reporters-car-hacked-to-murder-him.html">Michael Hastings’ car</a> could theoretically have been hacked, the concept of a <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2344398/Google-futurist-claims-uploading-entire-MINDS-computers-2045-bodies-replaced-machines-90-years.html">direct mind upload to the Internet/Cloud</a> should be seen as more than troubling. If all of these lesser systems are open to surveillance and hacking, whether domestically or abroad, it would stand to reason that the mind, too, will be subject to security leaks, blunders, and deliberate alteration. Neurogadget.com reported the following:</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>Researchers at the <a href="http://static.usenix.org/events/sec12/">Usenix Security</a> conference have demonstrated a zero-day vulnerability in your brain. They achieved as much as a 40% success rate among a group of willing volunteers. The “hack” works by measuring the brain’s response to images flashed before your eyes, from which the researchers can determine things like your home location, date of birth, and even your credit card PIN. (<a href="http://neurogadget.com/2012/08/20/hacking-the-human-brain-not-as-impossible-as-you-think/4561">Source</a>)</p>

<h4 style="text-align: center"><a href="http://activistpost.net/brain101.html" target="_blank">This Chess Champ Memory Hack May Prevent Dementia (Ad)</a></h4>
<p>With the advent of <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2013/06/agenda-21-and-steady-state-techno.html">quantum computing</a>, some believe that encryption will guarantee the state of one’s mind, as it were. But given what we know now about corporate-government overlap and cooperation, will you be comfortable putting your mind literally in the Cloud? Remember, every new level of computation promises the guarantee of <i>more </i>safety and privacy, while every revelation points to a vast reduction of both. The merging of man and machine into the matrix could become a permanent nightmare from which it is impossible to awaken.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it’s immortality they are after, as Ray Kurzweil, Director of Engineering at Google, explains:</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>In his 2005 book <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Singularity-Is-Near-Transcend/dp/0143037889/ref=as_li_tf_sw?&amp;linkCode=wsw&amp;tag=natblaze-20">The Singularity Is Near</a></i>, Kurzweil predicted that ongoing achievements in biotechnology would mean that by the middle of the century, “humans will develop the means to instantly create new portions of ourselves, either biological or nonbiologicial,” so that people can have “a biological body at one time and not at another, then have it again, then change it.”</p>

<p>I’ll close with some potentially good news brought to us from long-time investigative reporter and author, Jon Rappoport. It is his assertion that the above-mentioned technologies are ultimately doomed to failure.</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>Why? It’s simple. The scientists don’t know what they’re doing. They have no clear objectives, and the notion of building an accurate picture of a few trillion neurons in action is as far from reality as a flea painting the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Jon goes on to suggest that the reductionist approach to the human brain is nothing more than wishful thinking (pardon the pun) for controllers.</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>The mind is not a material object at all. The mind is not the brain. (<a href="http://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2013/02/20/this-is-your-brain-on-neuroscience/">Source</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In fact, the human brain is infinitely complex and cannot be so easily pinned down, predicted, and manipulated. That is, if we won’t permit it to be.</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>Of course, the real cure is finding a way to attain our actual size, which is without boundaries. Then and only then do we begin to see our lives. Then we see the skies beyond the cartoon sky. Then we see the great adventure. Then we feel the cosmic boredom of the soul disintegrate. Then we feel Freedom, not freedom. Then we shrug off these fools and operators who are trying to enthrall us with their yak-yak-yak sewing machines of false knowledge. — Jon Rappoport</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>What are your thoughts? Is it inevitable that science will decode the human brain so completely that we will be at the mercy of mad scientists to play us like a version of <i>The Sims</i>? Or is humanity in fact greater than the sum of its parts; non-quantifiable and forever as free and boundless as it wishes to be?</b></p>

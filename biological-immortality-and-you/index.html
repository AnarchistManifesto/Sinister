<p>Old age and resulting death is a condition, and like all conditions it  can, and will inevitably be treated.</p>
<p>Already in nature, evolution has  left certain organisms endowed with what is known as “biological  immortality,” where the cells of the organism are continuously renewed  without deteriorating over time.</p>
<p>Of course, disease, predation, and  environmental conditions can cause the otherwise untimely death of such  organisms, but barring these exceptions, in theory they could perpetuate  themselves indefinitely.</p>

However, it is very unlikely that “none of this happened.” Since the  beginning of recorded history, man, and in particular, the ruling elite  have sought – after conquering all else – to defeat the last threat to  the ill-gotten wealth and power they have accumulated over their  lifespans – death. It is said the first emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang,  <a href="http://asianhistory.about.com/od/profilesofasianleaders/p/qinshihungbio.htm">died of mercury poisoning</a>  while experimenting with potions thought to grant extended life.The  Philosopher’s Stone was pursued throughout the Middle Ages by alchemists  both for its ability to transmutate lead into gold, and for its role in  producing an “elixir of life” granting its users immortality.</p>
<p>It is only in modern times that mainstream talking points seem to  encourage people to crawl into their graves contently and without  struggle, with even national health care systems writing off patients as  hopeless and drains on the system, better off dead. Strange that as  technology now stands to grant humanity one of its most sought-after  goals, we face what seems a concerted effort to acquaint the general  population with the concept of gladly embracing death.</p>
<p><b>The Science Behind Human Biological Immortality </b></p>
<p>The so-called “immortal jellyfish” has developed through evolution its  ability to cheat death. But what progress has science made in  translating such a feat into success for species that have evolved  without the means of defeating age-related deterioration? The US  National Institute of Health republished a 2008 report titled, “<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19145831">Telomere elongation and prolongation of lifespan in rats by unblocking of telomere caps</a>,” the abstract of which included:  </p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>Telomeres are the ends of chromosomes and are non-coding DNA  “end-capped” with structures containing DNA-quadruplexes and proteins.  Telomeres become shorter after each cell division, which is one of the  mechanisms of gradual ageing.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/quantumkey.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" class="noshadow" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-S15Jx0Jtkrg/Ty3geP33IlI/AAAAAAAAOYs/zWzYWSUWoZs/s271/the_quantum_key.jpg" style="border: none"></a>The abstract continues with: </p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>This experiment shows that telomeres were elongated by the combination  of hypoxia activated telomerase and a newly developed pharmacological  method removing the telomere cap when this combined method was applied  to the human lymphocyte culture and the Wistar rats. Rats from the  control group died at the age 1 year 7 month – 1 year 8 month, which is  typical for the Wistar rats from our sub-line. Rats from the  experimental group died at the age 2 year 4 month. The result Morris’s  labyrinth water test showed the better spatial memory function of rats  passed the telomere stabilization therapy. The results of these  experiments show the significant role of telomere stabilization therapy  in prolongation of lifespan. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In short, the DNA of each cell of most species have caps at the end to  protect the DNA during cell division. Each time cells divide, these caps  get shorter until eventually, the DNA itself begins deteriorating with  each cell division – thus bodily functions, both internal and external,  begin to deteriorate as well, causing aging and eventual death. The  therapy carried out by researchers using lab rats sought to extend and  stabilize these “caps,” granting the test subjects unnaturally long  lives. </p>
<p>Gizmag’s 2010 article, “<a href="http://www.gizmag.com/telomerase-aging-harvard-reverse-process-telomeres/17107/">Harvard team successfully reverses the aging process in mice</a>,” reported: </p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>The aging process – it’s undignified, unwanted, and many would say  unnecessary. After all, the cells in your body are constantly replacing  themselves – why can’t they do it without causing progressive  degradation of organs that lead to discomfort, weakness and death? Well,  perhaps they can. Harvard scientists have discovered that by  controlling certain genetic processes in mice, they can not only slow  down the aging process, but “dramatically” reverse it throughout the  body. It’s a massive discovery, but it won’t be able to be used in  humans yet without some pretty scary consequences.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Theory no more, the science of extending life at a cellular level is a  reality, one that can and inevitably will be translated to human  patients.</p>
<p>The science of life extension doesn’t stop with stabilizing telomeres. As the field of genetics and <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/?p=9969">synthetic biolog</a>y  expand, the ability to sequence, understand, analyze, re-sequence, and  reintroduce DNA into a patient will open new doors to both the treatment  of disease, and <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/?p=10438">regenerative medicine</a>,  including the regeneration of cells from a state of age or  environmentally-induced deterioration back to a younger, healthier  state.</p>
<p>Already, through the process of <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/?p=10049">gene therapy</a> (re-sequencing and reintroducing an improved version of a patient’s DNA), <a href="http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/34394/title/Dogs-Cured-of-Type-1-Diabetes/">diabetes has been cured in dogs</a>, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/9915393/Mice-cured-of-lung-cancer-with-gene-therapy.html">lung cancer has been treated in rats</a>, and human patients with <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/9738355/Emily-Whitehead-girl-whose-cancer-was-cured-by-HIV.html">terminal leukemia have given a second chance at life</a>.  The current limitations involve our ability to read and rewrite DNA  with the level of genetic “literacy” necessary to take a patient’s DNA  and extrapolate what it should look like, re-write it and reintroduce it  into their body on a full-spectrum scale to achieve full “biological  immortality.” </p>
<p>However, the ability to do this is being developed through a wide variety of research and competitions. </p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>While the reading, writing, rewriting, and reintroduction of DNA into  human patients is still in the realm of highly trained professionals  with vast resources at their disposal, the field of genetics and  synthetic biology is not  exclusively “super science.” In fact, genetics  and synthetic biology are increasingly becoming more accessible to a  greater number of people as technology and information continue to  advance and disseminate around the world. Computers and the Internet  make both the tools for participating in such fields more accessible, as  well as the knowledge necessary to use such tools.</p>

<p><i><b>Video</b>: Professor Jamie Davies, Professor of Experimental  Anatomy, presents “Synthetic Biology: the potential and the problems of  re-engineering life.”</i></p>
<p>As a result, there is a burgeoning <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuhsFCn5rZI&amp;feature=player_embedded">DIYbio (Do-It-Yourself Biology) movement (VIDEO)</a>  – with local labs open to the public where everything from DNA  extraction and DNA fingerprinting to gene splicing is taught and  executed in a safe and educational environment. </p>
<p>The Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s (MIT) annual <a href="http://igem.org/Main_Page">iGEM (International Genetically Engineered Machine) competition</a>  includes university students and now even high school students. The  competition involves developing new genetic sequences, introduced into  viruses and bacteria, changing their characteristics into something that  can be useful. An example used in, “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ushmgPM7HT8">Creating Life – The Ultimate Engineering Challenge” (YouTube)</a>,  involves a bacteria re-engineered to change color when it comes in  contact with a particular water-borne parasite. The bacteria could  theoretically be used in testing kits to determine the potability of  water around the world.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/organics.html" style="float: right;margin-left: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-5nLmWzKFs60/URRNIOJzCiI/AAAAAAAAUEc/HqENLf1jZeM/s250/BANNER150.jpg" alt=""></a>While re-engineering bacteria is not exactly human gene therapy, a lot of  the techniques, equipment, and theory is the same. By developing an  understanding and competence in iGEM-style exercises, the general  population would be better poised at tackling the more advanced  challenges human medicine presents us with. And by high schools and  universities developing their physical and academic infrastructure to  participate in iGEM-style competitions and challenges, they collectively  expand the fields of genetics and synthetic biology, including  increasing our human capital, thus making progress toward greater  achievements faster and more profound.</p>
<p>But do people realize the end game? Do people re-engineering bacteria in  high school and university labs, while reading headlines about the  latest breakthrough in gene therapy, understand the future that  potentially awaits us?</p>
<p><b>DARPA, the Malthusian Paradigm, and Burning Bridges </b></p>
<p>The Pentagon’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA as it  is more widely known, is actively involved in genetics and synthetic  biology research. Wired reported in its Pentagon-friendly “Danger Room,”  in an article titled, “<a href="http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2010/02/pentagon-looks-to-breed-immortal-synthetic-organisms-molecular-kill-switch-included/">Pentagon Looks to Breed Immortal ‘Synthetic Organisms,’ Molecular Kill-Switch Included</a>,” that:</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>The Pentagon’s mad science arm may have come up with its most radical  project yet. Darpa is looking to re-write the laws of evolution to the  military’s advantage, creating “synthetic organisms” that can live  forever — or can be killed with the flick of a molecular switch. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wired continued by reporting:  </p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>The project comes as Darpa also plans to throw $20 million into a new  synthetic biology program, and $7.5 million into “increasing by several  decades the speed with which we sequence, analyze and functionally edit  cellular genomes.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wired never directly answers the question as to what exactly the  Pentagon wants with “immortal organisms,” or what “organisms” these  would even be, but mention is made of the above cited experiments with  rats involving gene therapy, suggesting the possibility that human  biological immortality might be on the table. The mention of “increasing  by several decades the speed with which we sequence, analyze and  functionally edit cellular genomes” would be the exact area of focus  necessary for achieving human biological immortality.  </p>
<p>DARPA also has begun programs aimed at outsourcing research, collecting  genetic sequences created by researchers and standardizing them into a  library it can then use for whatever means the Pentagon and its  corporate-financier sponsors desire behind closed doors. Wired again  reports from its “Danger Room,” this time in an article titled, “<a href="http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2011/06/pentagons-new-factory-your-dna/">Pentagon’s New Factory: Your DNA</a>“:</p>

<p>Darpa is sick and tired of waiting around for Mother Nature. Instead,  it wants to take the life-making business into its own hands — and  manufacture new biological forms in a factory of mix-and-match bio-bits. </p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>A recent call for research  by the Pentagon’s mad science agency proposes a new program called  “Living Foundries.” The idea is to use biology as a manufacturing  platform to “enable on-demand production of new and high-value  materials, devices and capabilities.”</p>
<p>In other words, let’s engineer life to make stuff we want.</p>
<p>The fields of bioengineering and synthetic biology have already  produced some useful, scary and flat-out bizarre entities. Besides  renewable petroleum or steel strong spider silk, there are all sorts of  potential therapeutic, industrial and agricultural purposes for  reorganized DNA. </p>

<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/teslasecret/" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" class="noshadow" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/_qLAIskTQXUc/TaqAcrCPlhI/AAAAAAAAISQ/5uq527jnmDM/book-shape.jpg" style="border: none"></a>While Wired attempts to pander to “geek culture,” making DARPA sound  “hip” and “cool,” in reality one can scarcely imagine more dangerous  hands such technology could be in, or what absolute folly it would be  for researchers to work on, and then turn into the Pentagon the building  blocks for such an incredibly powerful set of genetic and synthetic  biological tools. The <a href="http://localorg.blogspot.com/2012/12/the-darpa-vacuum.html">dangers of the so-called “DARPA vacuum</a>” have already been warned against in great detail.</p>
<p>It is clear that DARPA, the Pentagon, and the corporate-financier  interests that direct both, are incredibly interested in harnessing the  power of synthetic biology. Like the Internet, these interests can be  kept in check if the population is educated and technically competent  enough to ensure no one power gains an overwhelming monopoly over such  technology. Already, with the advent of DIYbio and the increasing  popularity of MIT’s iGEM competition, it appears that the opportunity  for monopolizing the field of genetics and synthetic biology is already  slipping away. </p>
<p>But what if the population was convinced to pursue a philosophy that  blinded people to the potential advances we stand to achieve? What if  people could be convinced to just crawl into their graves willingly  after learning to enjoy a life of increasingly limited resources and  liberties? That is just what <a href="http://landdestroyer.blogspot.com/2012/04/church-of-malthus.html">the Malthusian paradigm</a>  aims at achieving in the minds of billions around the planet – a  paradigm that literally seeks to burn the bridges behind the global  elite as they achieve biological immortality and resource abundance,  while denying it to a condemned and self-euthanized humanity.</p>
<p>From faux-environmentalism that encourages us to do less, with less,  while leaving multinational corporations free to continue pillaging the  planet on a global scale, to the human-hating population control polices  encouraged by Western governments and even across the United Nations,  humanity is being encouraged to whither and die as a “solution” to a  series of manufactured, fabricated, and otherwise artificial crises,  both social and environmental.</p>

3D printing, <a href="http://localorg.blogspot.com/2012/12/decenralize-big-retail.html">decentralized infrastructure</a>, <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/?p=9969">genetics and synthetic biology</a>  we can not only cross the bridge into the future together, we can  ensure that it is guarded for all time so that all others may follow. </p>
<p>Real solutions don’t involve protests, political slogans, or elections.  They involve small steps taken each day by determined, and far-sighted  individuals, collectively working together for our collective best  interests. Something as simple as researching and talking about topics  like synthetic biology or 3D printing can help place these first, small  steps in the right direction. The problems we face, created by  insidious, persistent, and patient individuals will be countered by  nothing less than patient persistent pragmatism. If a future of resource  abundance, biological immortality, and the conquest of cancer,  diabetes, and other maladies that have plagued us for generations sounds  like something you can get behind – drop the placards, leave the polls,  switch off Fox and CNN, and spend your free time at a <a href="http://hackerspaces.org/wiki/List_of_Hacker_Spaces">local hackerspace</a>, <a href="http://diybio.org/local/">DIYbio lab</a>, or by building your own. </p>
<p>The future is what we make of it, and if with our own two hands we are making nothing, we have no future. </p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 0in">One of the most dangerous philosophical  contentions even amongst liberty movement activists is the conundrum of  government force and prevention during times of imminent pandemic.  All  of us at one time or another have had this debate.  If a legitimate  viral threat existed and threatened to infect and kill millions of  Americans, is it then acceptable for the government to step in, remove  civil liberties, enforce quarantines, and stop people from spreading the  disease?  After all, during a viral event, the decisions of each  individual can truly have a positive or negative effect on the rest of  society, right?  One out of control (or “lone wolf”) citizen/terrorist  could reignite a biological firestorm, so, should we not turn to  government and forgo certain freedoms in order to achieve the greater  good for the greater number?</div>
<p>
<a name="more"></a>If the government in question was a proven and honorable institution,  then I would say pro-Medical Martial Law arguments might have a leg to  stand on.  However, this is not the case.  In my view, <a href="http://activistpost.net/familysurvivalsystem.html">medical martial  law</a> is absolutely unacceptable under ANY circumstances, including Ebola,  in light of the fact that our current government will be the  predominant cause of viral outbreak.  That is to say, you DO NOT turn to  the government for help when the government is the cause of the  problem.</p>
<p>The recent rise of global Ebola is slowly bringing the issue of medical martial law to the forefront of our culture.  <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/charles-krauthammer-ebola-vs-civil-liberties/2014/10/16/5e249a28-5561-11e4-892e-602188e70e9c_story.html">Charles Krauthammer at The Washington Post</a>  recently argued in favor of possible restrictions on individual and  Constitutional liberties in the face of a viral pandemic threat.</p>
<p>The CDC now argues that in the case of people who may be potential  carriers, or even in the case of people who refuse to undergo  screenings, it has the legal authority to <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/cdc-could-quarantine-u-s--citizens-for-weeks-if-they-refuse-ebola-screenings-230534518.html">dissolve all constitutional protections</a> and essentially imprison (quarantine) an American citizen for as long as they see fit to do so.</p>
<p>The Obama Administration is now using militant terminology in reference to Ebola response, including the formation <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2014/10/15/obama-ebola-campaign-trip-postponed/17304339/">of “Ebola SWAT Teams”</a> for quick reaction to potential outbreak areas.</p>

<p>In typical socialist fashion, the nurses union ‘National Nurses United’ has called for Barack Obama to <a href="http://www.nationalnursesunited.org/press/entry/nurses-call-on-obama-to-direct-hospitals-to-follow-highest-standards-for-be/">use “executive authority”</a>  to take control of all Ebola response protocols in hospitals across the  country.  Yet another perpetuation of the myth that more government  power is the solution.</p>
<p>And finally, the Department of Defense has been tasked to create a <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/19/health/us-ebola/index.html">military controlled “quick-strike team”</a>  to deal with Ebola within U.S. borders.  This team will be under the  command of none other than Northcom, apparently trampling the Posse  Comitatus Act and setting the stage for the rationalized use of military  personnel against U.S. citizens under the guise of pandemic prevention.</p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>It should be clear to anyone with half a brain that medical martial  law is being quietly prepared, and that the threat of such measures is  not a paranoid conspiracy, but a very real possibility.  It should also  be noted that such provisions are not only the products of the Obama  Administration.  It was George W. Bush who first created laws  intersecting with the <a href="http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/influenza/FluCheck6web.pdf">World Health Organization’s pandemic preparedness planning</a>.   These laws include the “overrule of existing legislation or  (individual) human rights” in order to quell a viral outbreak, and were  originally drafted around the potential of an influenza crisis.</p>
<p>It is this kind of executive overreach that has set precedence for states such as Connecticut to <a href="http://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/Governor-Declares-State-of-Emergency-Over-Ebola-as-a-Precaution-278378881.html">announce a tentative state of emergency</a> with medical martial law restrictions.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/bulletproof.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 0em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-gZ43kS1gnwk/U5TCxnk-RlI/AAAAAAAAAsA/BtpQBfFlwHI/s220/bulletproofhome1.gif"></a>I discussed in great detail why Ebola works in favor of establishment elites in my article <a href="http://www.alt-market.com/articles/2354-an-ebola-outbreak-would-be-advantageous-for-globalists">‘An Ebola Outbreak Would Be Advantageous For Globalists’</a>.</p>
<p>Understand that bureaucrats will come to you with promises of  offering a helping hand, hoping that you are afraid enough to accept,  but their intentions will not be compassionate.  Rather, their intent  will be to assert as much dominance over the public as possible during  the chaos, and to erase any conception the people may have had in the  past that they have inalienable rights.</p>
<p>But going beyond the hidden motives of tyrants, I think it is  important to point out that the Center for Disease Control and the  federal government in general has already lost all credibility in  dealing with Ebola, and therefore, it has lost any authority it may have  had in administrating a future response.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ebola-Natural-Human-History-Deadly-ebook/dp/B00O3GS0FE?tag=permacultucom-20&amp;linkCode=w13&amp;linkID=FGBNVPA47LBE2NTM&amp;ref_=assoc_res_sw_result_2">Ebola</a> has been officially known to the CDC for over thirty years.   Why has the CDC refused for three decades to produce proper care  guidelines for hospitals?  Medical staff in the U.S. didn’t even receive  guidelines when the outbreak in Western Africa was obviously  progressing out of control.</p>
<p>Why did the CDC leave Thomas Duncan, the very first U.S. Ebola case,  in the hands of the Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, without proper  procedures in place to prevent further infection, and without a CDC team  present?  The CDC has an annual budget of nearly $7 billion.  Where is  all of this money going if not to stamp out such threats as Ebola?</p>
<p>The argument presented by the White House, the CDC, and even the  World Bank, has been that stopping direct or indirect travel from  nations with an Ebola outbreak would be “impractical”, and that such  travel bans would somehow “make matters worse”.  They have yet to  produce a logical explanation as to how this makes sense, but what if we  did not need to institute a travel ban?  The CDC, with it’s massive  budget, could easily establish quarantine measures in infected  countries. Anyone wishing to travel outside of these nations would be  welcome to do so, as long as they voluntarily participate in quarantine  procedures for a set number of days.  No quarantine, no plane ticket.   Where has the CDC response been in Western Africa?</p>
<p>Why not use minor and measured travel restriction in Africa today,  instead of using unprecedented martial law in America tomorrow?  It  makes no sense, unless, of course, the plan is to allow Ebola to  spread…</p>
<p>Why has the White House nominated Ron Klain, a man who knows  absolutely NOTHING about Ebola or medical emergency strategies, as the  new “Ebola Czar”?</p>
<p>Why has all discussion on Ebola prevention revolved around government  measures rather than community measures?  Why has all talk centered on  what the government will do AFTER an outbreak occurs, rather than on  what can be done to prevent an outbreak in the first place?</p>
<p>The reality is that the federal government does not have any  treatments for Ebola that are outside of the knowledge and capabilities  of the average medically trained citizen.  Meaning, the government and  the CDC are NOT needed for a community to handle an Ebola outbreak, if  that community is given proper guidelines and strategies in advance.   Treatment for Ebola, at least in first world nations, consists primarily  of regimented transfusions.  These transfusions are a mixture of  isotonic saline, electrolytes, and plasma, designed to keep the body  supported until its immune system can build up a proper defense to the  virus.  Natural and homeopathic methods can also boost immune system  functions making the body resistant to the virus before it is ever  contracted.  The most effective of all treatments appears to be the <a href="http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/179/Supplement_1/S18.long">transfusion of blood from a recovering patient</a> with antibodies into a newly sick patient.  This is likely the reason for the quick recovery of infected doctors <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Health/blood-transfusions-ebola-survivor-dr-kent-brantly-patients/story?id=26182136">like Kent Brantly</a>.</p>
<p>The CDC would never be able to coherently organize a large-scale  program of transfusion initiatives, even if it wanted to.  Most  hospitals around the country have no isolation wards able to handle even  a minor Ebola outbreak.  The hospitals that do have facilities are  limited to less than a dozen beds. According to the medical workers I  have spoken with, most hospitals require a minimum of around 50 health  professionals to deal with a single Ebola patient.  In the event of an  outbreak larger than a few people per state, the CDC and local hospitals  are simply not equipped to react to the problem.  Blood transfusions  from recovering donors would be few and far between, unless organized by  local citizens working under their own directives.</p>
<p>Ironically, it was the Bush Administration’s own report in 2006 on  the possibility of bird flu pandemic that admitted the government is  completely unequipped to handle an outbreak of moderate size.  <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2006-05-04/news/0605040168_1_pandemic-infectious-disease-research-report">The report stated that</a>  “all sources of external aid may be compromised during a pandemic,” and  that “local communities will have to address the medical and  non-medical effects of the pandemic with available resources.”  Little  has changed in the federal government’s pandemic preparations since the  report was written.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/familysurvivalsystem.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-n_UrhLA9Hyc/UjeZypV_-mI/AAAAAAAAVKc/ytiaG7XcGXQ/s220/220marines.gif"></a>This leaves individual communities to either prepare for the worst,  or die off while waiting for the government to save them.  Self  isolation and self treatment are the only practical options.</p>
<p>The greatest danger to American citizens is, in fact, not the Ebola  virus, but government reactions to the Ebola virus.  Already, several  medical outfits around the world are suddenly interested in producing an  Ebola vaccination when no one seemed very interested before.  This  might sound like good news, until you learn the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Vaccine-Epidemic-Corporate-Coercive-Government/dp/1620872129?tag=permacultucom-20&amp;linkCode=w13&amp;linkID=FGBNVPA47LBE2NTM&amp;ref_=assoc_res_sw_result_2">terrible history of  modern vaccinations</a>.</p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>GlaxoSmithKline, a major vaccine producer, has been caught repeatedly attempting to <a href="http://www.transactrx.com/healthcare-news/canadian-vaccine-manufacturer-raises-concerns-of-health-canada-fda/">bribe doctors and health professionals</a> into promoting their products or outright lying about their effectiveness.  Glaxo was caught producing <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/03/22/rotavirus.vaccine/">rotavirus vaccinations tainted with a swine virus</a> in 2010.  Glaxo has been caught producing vaccines tainted with bacteria and endotoxins.</p>
<p>It is important to point out that Glaxo is also spearheading an <a href="http://www.thanhniennews.com/health/glaxosmithkline-planning-ebola-vaccine-altenpohl-32510.html">Ebola vaccine initiative</a>.</p>
<p>U.S. company Baxter produced a flu vaccination in Austria tainted  with both avian flu and swine flu.  The mixture just happened to be  randomly tested on a group of ferrets by a lab in the Czech Republic.  The test animals died.  The exposure of this “mix up” <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Virus-mix-up-by-lab-could-have-resulted-in-pandemic/articleshow/4230882.cms">was quietly swept under the rug by Baxter</a>  and the mainstream media, but reports indicate that if the vaccine had  been used on the general population, a terrible pandemic would have  erupted.</p>
<p>Beyond the fact that vaccinations have a tendency to cripple our  natural immune system and infect patients with the very disease they are  meant to prevent, none of these existing companies can be trusted to  produce a vaccine that is safe even by traditional pharmaceutical  standards (which are very low).  If the CDC and the federal government  trigger a <a href="http://activistpost.net/familysurvivalsystem.html">medical martial la</a>w scenario, they will most likely include  forced vaccination of the population to maintain “herd immunity”.  The  bottom line?  The use of such vaccines will be a death sentence for  many, a death more certain than the contraction of Ebola.  In my  opinion, Ebola vaccination should be avoided at all costs by the  American populace.</p>
<p>I can think of no rationale for government involvement in the  treatment of an Ebola outbreak.  If it is not pure incompetence on their  part that has exacerbated the threat, then even worse, it is a  deliberate program of genocide.  In either case, no military or CDC  “strike teams” should be allowed free reign in our neighborhoods, towns,  counties, or states.  DHS and FEMA Community Emergency Response Teams  (CERT) are also a no go, given FEMA’s track record of dismal disaster  response.  They CANNOT be allowed to take control of our communities.</p>
<p>The only way for Americans to survive such an event is to cut out  government entirely and establish their own medical strategies, as  organizations like the <a href="http://oathkeepers.org/oath/2014/10/08/oath-keepers-cpt-journal-%E2%80%93-eureka-mountain-watch-october-8th-2014/">Oath Keepers Community Preparedness Teams (CPT)</a> are doing.</p>
<p>If someone wants to voluntarily go to the CDC or FEMA for assistance,  then they should be allowed to take that risk.  However, <a href="http://activistpost.net/familysurvivalsystem.html">medical  martial law</a> over all of us in the name of the “greater good” should not  be tolerated.  The government has proven beyond a doubt that it is not  qualified to handle a viral crisis scenario, let alone determine what  the “greater good” actually is.  I can’t speak for the whole of the  Liberty Movement, but as for myself, if a group of hazmat suited thugs  decides to chase me down with a syringe, I am relatively certain none of  them will live through the encounter.</p>
<p>Will I be accused of aiding the spread of Ebola because of my  non-compliance?  Of course.  Do I care?  Not so much.  Each individual  American will have to make their own decision on this matter in due  course.  Is it better to conform and risk annihilation at the hands of  an ignorant and/or corrupt government, or, to fight back and be labeled a  bio-terrorist?  With the clear lack of tangible government preventions  for outbreak in the U.S., you’ll probably get your chance to find out  soon enough.</p>

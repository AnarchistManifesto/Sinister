<p>What a question even to ask!  But –  someone, something—perhaps conspiracies—as many are encouraged by the  global media to believe – truly have brought the planet and humankind  out of mediaeval misery, but equally into profoundly dangerous  circumstances.  However, not many who, apparently, are responsible for  Planet Earth, aka Mother Earth—Gaia, being trashed before our very eyes,  either are fessing up or getting their respective or collective  recognition, and all while continuing to profit from poisoning our dying  planet. </p>
<p><b>Every day, commonplace humans who live, work, and try to make ends meet are being blamed for ruining Planet Earth.  Why? </b></p>
<p><a name="more"></a>We,  the ‘seeming-low-life’ in the elite’s minds, are saddled with being  responsible for all the ills that plague the planet, if you listen to  the media. Yet, that deflection is nowhere near fact, in this writer’s  opinion.  My reasoning: Who really is it that, manufacturers, finances,  operates, and mainstreams the money-making technologies that have been  touted and allowed to run without checks and balances on how they  negatively impact Planet Earth, the environment, and all living matter? </p>
<p><b>Who controls business and industry?  </b></p>
<p>Aren’t  moguls such as J.P. Morgan, Andrew Carnegie, Andrew W. Mellon, and John  D. Rockefeller responsible for setting the corporate paradigm while  creating industrial and economic dynasties that, in essence, have  overtaken science, the environment, and created vested interest lobbying  practices that make certain 99% of non-elites comply with their  fascist-like quest for wealth through influencing government? </p>

<p>The  industrial age of the robber barons spawned the current  corporate-government-run world, in my opinion. It was only a matter of  time when tycoon money would overtake science, including eugenics, <a href="http://www.cholesterol-and-health.com/Rockefeller-Foundation-Social-Control-Eugenics.htm">as  the Rockefellers did</a> and, apparently, influence others, as per family member David Rockefeller, who said in his <i>Memoirs</i>, </p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">

</blockquote>
<p>As  one who has lived 76 years and counting, I know much more about life,  living, and what the planet/world and the environment were like prior to  the last twenty-five or so years.  I lived and remember the days of  crystal clear, powder blue skies with fluffy white clouds, not smudged  shadow clouds, apparently ‘created’ by weather geo-engineers spraying  horrendous toxic chemicals, including viruses, down on all of Creation.</p>

<p><b>Those  dirty clouds</b>, which contain aluminum-chaff particulates that can bounce  microwaves around to heat the atmosphere and precipitate weather and  probably the Jet Stream for a Polar Vortex, undoubtedly, began as a  result of “A Recommended National Program In Weather Modification”  produced by NASA as ICAS Report No. 10a, November 1966, documented <a href="http://www.geoengineeringwatch.org/documents-library/a-recomended-national-program-in-weather-modification-icas-report-10a/">here</a> and <a href="http://www.geoengineeringwatch.org/documents/19680002906_1968002906.pdf">here</a> for the 97 page report in its entirety. </p>
<p><b>So, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/What-The-World-They-Spraying/dp/B00483VQTE?tag=permacultucom-20&amp;linkCode=w13&amp;linkID=FGBNVPA47LBE2NTM&amp;ref_=assoc_res_sw_result_1">what really are they spraying in chemtrails?</a></b>  A scientific analysis done in California confirms the following elements: </p>

<p>Those  types of elements/chemicals/metals should not be raining down on  humans, who breathe their particulates into our lungs.  Can those  chemtrail ‘ingredients’ be a cause for the precipitous rise in lung  diseases and cancers? </p>
<p>Probably, according to a news  release from UC Davis Health System, “Lung doctors expect respiratory  diseases will worsen with global climate change.”  However, medical  doctors, others who ought to be concerned, and the U.S. CDC/FDA  seemingly aren’t doing anything to stop the aerial spraying that now  saturates U.S. skies, but also encircles the globe!  Why? </p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/stepoutsidethebox.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-kADbI3spO2M/TwILKt_It9I/AAAAAAAANvU/F0N-dw_gGR4/s261/cancer.png"></a>However, as of January 21, 2015, a new chemtrail ‘recipe’ that’s part of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=5HqqnrQWC5U#t=3">U.S. Air Force’s Project Indigo Skyfold</a>, supposedly  includes radioactive materials, which should make chemtrails invisible!  What will PIS do to human lungs, eyes, and health in general? </p>
<p>PIS  probably will interact with the Jet Stream to create more Polar Vortex  happenings in the lower U.S. states.  Someone’s on to what’s going on: </p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>Katharine Hayhoe, a Texas Tech climate scientist in Lubbock,  said the study “provides      important insight into the cascading  nature of the <b>effects human activities are having on     the planet.”</b>  [1] [Emphasis added]  </p>

<p><b>Then there’s the California drought</b> that’s now <a href="http://www.geoengineeringwatch.org/engineered-drought-catastrophe-target-california/">entering its fourth year</a>.<a href="http://www.geoengineeringwatch.org/engineered-drought-catastrophe-target-california/"></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/alexnaidus/california-drought-images#.heNgyLn86">Here</a> are dramatic contrast photographs taken  July 20, 2011 compared with August 19, 2014 photos. </p>
<p>Many  researchers contend the California drought is the intended result of  weather geo-engineering, aka chemtrails, plus HAARP microwave activity.  There is speculation that the newer recipe in Project Indigo Skyfold is  designed to drive the California drought conditions farther east into  the mid-section or breadbasket of the USA.  Where’s Congress on this  one? </p>
<p><b>Who formulated Project Indigo Skyfold and why?</b></p>
<p><b><i>But then, aren’t we THE ones being blamed</i>?</b> Which human activities are having effects on the planet? </p>
<p><b>Weather geoengineering</b> is the deliberate atmospheric spraying of sky trails, aka <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=chemtrails&amp;biw=982&amp;bih=531&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ILq6VKTXEIapNqeRgqgL&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CD8QsAQ">chemtrails.</a> </p>
<p>I  assure you, in all my life, until relatively recently, I NEVER saw  those tic-tac-toe patterns in the sky, which some contend are contrails,  anywhere in the world that I happened to have been, and I’ve traveled  quite a bit in my life.  A true atmospheric contrail dissolves within  seconds to a less than a minute behind modern day jets, as <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=chemtrails&amp;biw=982&amp;bih=531&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ILq6VKTXEIapNqeRgqgL&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CD8QsAQ#tbm=isch&amp;q=chemtrails+versus+contrails+photos">these  photographs</a> verify. </p>
<p>So,  are you the reader, or I the writer, or some poor native in the African  jungle, or some monk in Nepal spraying those weather modification  chemtrails?  Nope!  Who is, then?

<p>
Searching the Internet I could not find old-time, pre-chemtrail, pure-white clouds of my younger years.  Are they gone forever?  I sure hope not! </p>
<p>Actually, I must admit that I’ve always thought back to a time when a ‘curtain of disbelief’ descended upon humanity and Earth – the 1950s.  The most dramatic events that precipitated out-of-hand technology were the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=atomic+bomb+ww2&amp;biw=982&amp;bih=531&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=18C6VMvEDsegNrPBgLAD&amp;ved=0CDIQsAQ">two atomic bombs dropped</a> on Japan in 1945.  I remember both those August 1945 days like they were yesterday.  Now, as an older and hopefully wiser person, I shudder at what men have wrought.  For those who believe in karma or “do unto others as you would have them do unto you,” what can we expect? </p>
<p>Responsible individuals don’t mainstream a technology for which they cannot safely dispose of its waste materials or which have to be guarded in thick cement for hundreds of thousands of years, or more.  Plus, knowingly ‘re-invent’ and propagate that technology as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atoms_for_Peace">“Atoms for Peace”</a>.  To put nuclear fission/atomic energy technologies into proper perspective, this is what Albert Einstein said about his contribution: </p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p><b><i>I made one great mistake in my life—when I signed the letter to President Roosevelt             recommending that atom bombs be made; but there was some justification—the danger that the Germans would make them.</i></b> [2] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The World War II years, and immediately following, were the turning point in the history of humankind’s ascent into technology along with a complicated, but fascinating, descent into the techno-chemical age from which we cannot extricate ourselves.  Everything was in technological flux: There were television sets, antibiotics, and chemicals being produced from recipes taken from captured German scientists, which eventually would become concepts for the USA pharmaceutical and chemical industries. </p>
<p>The role that the U.S. government played in that ‘start up’ began with <a href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/esp_sociopol_mj12_17.htm">Project Paperclip</a>.  </p>
<p>And, that role in time only became BIGGER, all-encompassing, and even global!  </p>
<p>Currently, the U.S. Air Force and Navy are at the forefront of owning the weather as a ‘weapon of war’.  See <a href="http://csat.au.af.mil/2025/volume3/vol3ch15.pdf">“Weather as a Force Multiplier: Owning the Weather in 2025”</a>, a U.S. military publication. </p>
<p>To my way of thinking what I saw in the 1950s, seemed like so many things were changing very fast and that civilization was on a fast-track trajectory.  One dramatic clue for me, even at that time, was automobiles.  To illustrate my point, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=autos+of+the+1940s&amp;biw=982&amp;bih=531&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bo66VPyuCcidNrrfgfgF&amp;ved=0CCUQsAQ">here</a> is how cars previously to the 1950s looked; while <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=autos+of+the+1940s&amp;biw=982&amp;bih=531&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bo66VPyuCcidNrrfgfgF&amp;ved=0CCUQsAQ#tbm=isch&amp;q=autos+of+the+1950s">here</a> is how cars during the 1950s looked!  </p>
<p>In retrospect, what I intuitively realized was that <b>technology</b> apparently was taking over and eventually would be positioned as a new ‘god’, probably to replace the God of the Old Testament.  Or, maybe ‘god’ would be <b>science</b>, or science would become the new god.  Both ‘gods’ vigorously activated their overwhelming quests almost like fast-morphing viruses, which eventually turned into global pandemics of fear, sickness, polluted food, water and air, and a force-fed media campaign that Nature seemingly doesn’t count anymore—science knows better.   </p>
<p><b>But look what that got us.</b></p>
<p>One issue as an example: Medicine decried breast feeding babies.  According to <b><i>Wikipedia</i></b>, </p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>By the 1950s, the predominant attitude to breastfeeding was that it was something            practiced by the uneducated and those of lower classes. The practice was considered     old-fashioned and “a   little disgusting” for those who could not afford infant formula and        <b>discouraged by medical practitioners and media of the time.</b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_and_culture_of_breastfeeding#cite_note-naoo-19">[19]</a> Letters and           editorials to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatelaine_(magazine)">Chatelaine</a> from 1945 to as late as 1995 regarding breastfeeding were      predominately negative. [3] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Manufactured baby formula was better than Mothers’ breast milk! </p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>In the late 1920s, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alfred_Bosworth&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">Alfred Bosworth</a> released <i>Similac </i>(for “similar to lactation”), and Mead             Johnson released <i>Sobee</i>.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant_formula#cite_note-Schuman-9">[9]</a> Several other formulas were released over the next few decades, but <b>commercial formulas did not begin to seriously compete with      evaporated milk formulas until the 1950s</b>. The reformulation and concentration of          Similac in 1951, and the introduction (by Mead Johnson) of Enfamil (for “infant meal”)             in 1959 were accompanied by <b>marketing campaigns that provided inexpensive     formula to hospitals and pediatricians.</b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant_formula#cite_note-Schuman-9">[9]</a> By the early 1960s, commercial formulas          were more commonly used than evaporated milk formulas in the United States, which all           but vanished in the 1970s. <b>By the early 1970s, over 75% of American babies were fed         on formulas, almost entirely commercially produced.</b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant_formula#cite_note-Fomon-4">[4]</a>    [4] [Emphasis added] </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Who profited from changing the natural way of feeding babies from time immemorial?</b>  Those who manufactured, advertised, and sold baby formula.  The advertising campaigns were so intense that mothers actually believed a snake-oil-like sales-pitch.  Again, it was those who were at the helms of industry and commerce who preyed on both infants and mothers that deprived babies of their natural right to wholesome nutrition and immunological conditioning through human breast milk.  Plus, the pharmaceutical industry even produced pills to <a href="http://www.lactationconsultant.info/dryup.html">stop natural lactation</a>.  </p>
<p><b>Back in those years, medical doctors were revered.</b>  If a doctor said it, it had to be factual.  One classic faux pas the advertising industry, medical doctors, and cigarette makers committed was having MDs endorse certain brands of cigarettes, and tobacco use as not being harmful.  See the following from <a href="http://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2012/01/big-tobacco-led-throat-doctors-to-blow-smoke.html">Stanford University</a>, plus these <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=doctors+promoting+smoking&amp;biw=982&amp;bih=531&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Pcy6VPLQDMeagwTfu4GIAg&amp;ved=0CCIQsAQ&amp;dpr=1.25">actual advertisements</a>.  </p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/miraclecure.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-cy2Lpzbsd5E/U35cEf2njVI/AAAAAAAAAow/cu-TTd9iPO4/s220/300x250.gif"></a><b>So, again, who profited from pushing tobacco on the consumer? </b> Manufacturers, advertisers, and those who sold the products!  And, everyone else who bought into what’s been called “tobacco science” has paid the price ever since with ruined health, inflating healthcare costs, and government tobacco subsidies for years, which taxpayers paid for.  So, you see, it’s always those at the top who invent, make, sell, and profit from technological innovations, which are to blame not those who, unfortunately, buy into their technological advances, most of which harm us. </p>
<p><b>Today we have cell phones and their omnipresent <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/040905_cell_phone_towers_radiation_cancer.html">cell towers with their overlooked harms</a></b> and <a href="http://www.safespaceprotection.com/electrostress-from-cell-towers.aspx">this</a>. </p>
<p><b>Again, who profits, who pollutes, and who suffers?</b></p>
<p>Returning to after WWII and how technologies were taking off, especially in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries, <a href="http://propex.com/C_f_env_formldy.htm">formaldehyde</a> became big time stuff.  You could not breathe in fabric stores, as they were so overwhelmed with formaldehyde fumes.  Carpeting impregnated and made with formaldehyde was another disaster, and set in motion a new syndrome, which has become known as <a href="http://www.webmd.com/allergies/multiple-chemical-sensitivity">Multiple Chemical Sensitivity (MCS)</a>. </p>
<p>Some houses even were insulated with formaldehyde foam and people got dramatically sick!  Again, technology not thought out correctly nor applied properly that’s made millions for business tycoons but damaged or killed millions of others.  Even OSHA <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/81-123/pdfs/0293.pdf">declared formaldehyde a carcinogen</a>, but it’s still being used in many products. </p>
<p><b>The current technological advance of fracking for shale gas and oil</b> has made millionaires out of drillers and landowners, but has given the environment more problems.  Ground water is poisoned and polluted so much that running water from kitchen faucets can be lighted with a match.</p>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=4LBjSXWQRV8#t=33">https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=4LBjSXWQRV8#t=33</a> . </p>
<p>Furthermore, earthquakes now are being implicated as <a href="http://www.earthworksaction.org/issues/detail/fracking_earthquakes#.VLrSHhQ5D9I">direct effects from fracking.</a> </p>
<p>All the issues I’ve talked about, plus there are thousands more that could be included but this article would never end, cause serious damage to the planet, the environment, and us.  They can cause toxic outgassing, pollution, exploit natural resources, contaminate, and cause all sorts of health problems, some of which had not been on modern medicine’s radar very long, e.g., <a href="http://www.morgellonsexposed.com/">Morgellon’s disease</a>.  Plus, they trash the planet! </p>
<p><b>The oceans are a disaster with all the toxic elements in them.</b>  Some claim <a href="http://www.geoengineeringwatch.org/dying-fish-dying-oceans-are-we-next/">the oceans are dying</a>. </p>

<p>How about the <a href="http://www.whoi.edu/page.do?pid=69136">nuclear radiation from the 2011 Fukushima disaster</a> still radioactively poisoning air, land, and ocean?  </p>
<p><b>So, who really is to blame? </b></p>
<p>I cringe at the thought of a destroyed, once-beautiful <a href="http://www.andrewchaikin.com/2010/10/23/a-blue-planet-a-turquoise-jewel/">Blue Jewel</a>, Planet Earth.  I’m of the belief that even though we, the 99%, may not invent nor control all the technology that is destroying living organisms on earth, we actually are partly to blame because we have not stood up against government, business, industry, and others who manipulate us into believing in and accepting that man-made science is better than Nature, Intelligent Design, or the natural evolutionary processes.  So, how bad are things?  Take a look at <a href="http://all-that-is-interesting.com/pollution-in-china-photographs#3">what’s happening in China</a>. </p>

<p>A rather expensive and intricately designed granite monument in Elbert County, Georgia, USA, may give some insights, or clues, as to what’s going on and that there also IS a concentrated effort afoot to control Nature and most of all, human beings!  It’s the <a href="http://www.radioliberty.com/stones.htm">Georgia Guidestones</a>. There are ten messages, which some refer to as the new ten commandments.  The first is more than chilling!  </p>
<p>Are all the technological ‘advances’ that, in essence, destructively interact with Nature, the Planet, and humans a scientifically-approved, culturally-admired, and government-imposed ‘ways and means’ to accomplish <b>the Georgia Guidestone’s first ‘directive’</b>: </p>

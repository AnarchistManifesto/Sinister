<a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2012/10/self-sufficiency-local-solution-to.html"><b>Activist Post</b></a></p>
<p>When  thinking about “solutions” many are quick to cite organizing a protest  and taking to the streets. Let’s for a moment consider the mechanics of a  protest, what it might accomplish, and what it may leave to be desired.</p>
<p>Take Glenn Beck’s disingenuous 2010 “<a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/08/28/thousands-expected-glenn-beck-rally-civil-rights-leaders-protest-event/">Restoring Honor</a>”  event in Washington D.C.  It drew thousands of honest, well-intentioned  people from all over the United States.</p>
<p>Indeed, thousands of people  filled up their Fortune 500 made cars with gas from Fortune 500 oil  companies, drove countless miles, stopping along the way at Fortune 500  fast food restaurants, stayed at Fortune 500 run hotels, and stocked up  on supplies purchased at Fortune 500 Walmart. They slaked their thirst  under the hot August sun with cans of Fortune 500 Pepsi and Coke, and at  the end of the day, they drove home, paid their Fortune 500 cable  subscriptions to watch their Fortune 500 media reports, most likely on  News Corporation’s Fox News, <a href="http://www.cfr.org/about/corporate/roster.html">a Council on Foreign Relations corporate member</a>.</p>
<p>At best, all a protest will lead to, while we are so  hopelessly dependent on this system, is a round of musical chairs inside  the political arena, with perhaps superficial concessions made to the  people. The vector sum, however, will still be decidedly in favor of the  global corporate-financier oligarchy.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>If we understand that the  fundamental problem facing not only America, but the entire world, <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/?p=20431">is a global corporate-financier oligarchy</a> that has criminally consolidated  their wealth by “liberalizing” their own activities while strangling  ours through regulations, taxes, and laws, we should then understand why  events like Beck’s “Restoring Honor” are not only fruitless, but in  fact, counterproductive. We should also realize that any activity we  commit ourselves to must be directed at this corporate-financier  oligarchy rather than the governments they have co-opted and positioned  as buffers between themselves and the masses.</p>

<p>
While people  understand something is wrong and recognize the necessity to do  “something,” figuring out what that “something” is becomes  incredibly difficult when so few understand how power really works and  how to strip it from the oligarchs that have criminally  consolidated it.</p>
<p>Understanding Globalization</p>
<p>As  of late, the expansion of this global oligarchical empire has taken a  more extreme, perhaps desperate form involving <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/?p=14780">staged revolutions as seen in Egypt and Tunisia</a>,  and in Libya’s case, armed rebellion and foreign military intervention.  However, worldwide coups d’etat have occurred before – for example, in  the late 1990s  under the guise of a “financial collapse” and IMF “restructuring.”</p>
<p>Many  nations fell beholden to the IMF and its regiment of “reforms” which  amounted to neo-colonialism packaged under the euphemism of “economic  liberalization.”  To illustrate how this works, it may help to  understand what real colonialism looked like.</p>

Thailand  in the 1800s, then the Kingdom of Siam, was surrounded on all sides by  colonized nations and in turn was made to concede to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowring_Treaty">the British 1855 Bowring Treaty</a>. See how many of these “gunboat policy” imposed concessions sound like today’s “economic liberalization:”</p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>1. Siam granted extraterritoriality to British subjects.<br />
2. British could trade freely in all  seaports and reside permanently in Bangkok.<br />
3. British could buy and rent property in Bangkok.<br />
4. British  subjects could  travel freely in the interior with  passes provided by the consul.<br />
5. Import and export duties were capped at 3%, except the duty-free opium and bullion.<br />
6. British merchants were to be allowed to buy and sell directly with  individual Siamese.</p>
<p>A more contemporary example for comparison would be the outright military conquest of Iraq and Paul Bremer’s (<a href="http://www.cfr.org/about/membership/roster.html?letter=B">CFR</a>) economic reformation. The <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/2092719">Economist gleefully enumerates</a>    the neo-colonial “economic liberalization” of Iraq in a piece titled    “Let’s all go to the yard sale: If it all works out, Iraq will be a    capitalist’s dream:”</p>
<p>1. 100% ownership of Iraqi assets.<br />
2. Full repatriation of profits.<br />
3. Equal legal standing with local firms.<br />
4. Foreign banks allowed to operate or buy into local banks.<br />
5. Income and corporate taxes capped at 15%.<br />
6. Universal tariffs slashed to 5%.</p>

<p>And  few could argue that the IMF’s rehabilitation regiments being forced  upon nations all over the world after the late ’90s financial crash are  any different than economic colonialism both past and present. In fact,  the <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/ib/2001/110801.htm">IMF itself publishes reports</a> at great length concerning the “necessity” of economic liberalization.</p>
<p>To  be sure, the governments that come to power in the wake of the current  Middle East destabilizations will be more servile and will undoubtedly  be committed to similar economic liberalization. <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/opinions/2011/0227_middle_east_pollack.aspx">Brookings Institution’s Kenneth Pollack</a>  already made it quite clear that:</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>
The struggle in the new Middle East  must be defined as one between  nations that are moving in the right  direction and nations that are not;  between those that are embracing  economic liberalization, educational  reform, democracy, the rule of law  and civil liberties, and those that  are not.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Siam eventually  rolled back the terms of the 1855 Bowring Treaty as the British Empire  waned, but as of 1997, Thailand was once again faced with similar terms,  dictated this time by the bankers of the IMF.</p>
<p>Thailand’s Answer to Globalization</p>
<p>Thailand’s  answer to the IMF, and globalization in general was profound in both  implications as well as in its understanding of globalization’s end  game. Fiercely independent and nationalistic, and being the only nation  in Southeast Asia to avoid colonization, Thailand’s sovereignty has been  protected for over 800 years by its revered monarchy. The current  dynasty, the House of Chakri, has reigned nearly as long as America has  existed as a nation and the current king is regarded as the equivalent  of a living “Founding Father.” And just as it has for 800 years, the  Thai Monarchy today provides the most provocative and meaningful answer  to the threats facing the Kingdom.</p>
<p>The answer of course is  self-sufficiency. Self-sufficiency as a nation, as a province, as a  community and as a household. This concept is enshrined in the Thai  King’s “<a href="http://www.thaiembassy.jp/thailand/e-king.htm">New Theory</a>” or “self-sufficiency economy” and mirrors <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/?p=20800">similar efforts</a>  found throughout the world to break the back of the oppression and  exploitation that results from dependence on an interdependent globalized system.</p>

The  foundation of the self-sufficiency economy is simply growing your own  garden and providing yourself with your own food. This is portrayed on  the back right-hand side of every 1,000 baht Thai banknote as a picture  of a woman tending her garden. The next step is producing surplus that  can be traded for income, which in turn can be used <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/?p=11154">to purchase technology</a> to further enhance your ability to sustain yourself and  improve your lifestyle.</p>

<p>
The  New Theory aims at preserving traditional agrarian values in the hands  of the people. It also aims at preventing a migration from the  countryside into the cities. Preventing such migrations would prevent  big agricultural cartels from moving in, swallowing up farming land,  corrupting and even jeopardizing entire national food supplies (see  Monsanto). Those familiar with the UN’s <a href="http://www.un.org/esa/dsd/agenda21/">Agenda 21</a>, and the more recent UN “<a href="http://www.cop16.mx/en/mexicos-actions/executive-summary-special-climate-change-program-20092012-mexico/">Climate Change Program,</a>”  may understand the deeper implications and  dangers of such a migration and why it needs to be stopped.</p>
<p>By  moving to the city, people give up private property, cease pursuing  productive occupations, and end up being folded into a consumerist  paradigm. Within such a paradigm, problems like overpopulation,  pollution, crime, and economic crises can only be handled by a  centralized government and generally yield political solutions such as  quotas, taxes, micromanagement, and regulations rather than meaningful  technical solutions.</p>
<p>Also, such problems inevitably lead to a  centralized government increasing its own power, always at the expense  of the people and their freedom. The effects of economic catastrophe are  also greater in a centralized, interdependent society, where everyone  is subject to the overall health of the economy for even simple  necessities like food, water, and electricity.</p>

<p>
Under  the “New Theory,” demonstration stations all across Thailand have been  created promoting education in matters of agriculture and  self-sufficient living. The program is competing against the  contemporary globalization system, which as of now, is mired in many parts  of the world with economic meltdown. The relatively self-sufficient  nature of Thais in general has weathered this economic chaos fairly  well. In 10 years, a plate of food still costs the same amount of money,  as do many everyday commodities. This only further vindicates the value  of being self-sufficient and now more than ever, in both Thailand, and  abroad, it is a good time to get involved and get self-sufficient.</p>
<p>The West Strikes Back </p>
<p>Of  course the head-of-state of a nation almost 70 million strong promoting  a lifestyle that cuts the legs out from under the Western corporate-financier agenda does  not sit well with the oligarchical establishment. Their response to  this, as it has been with all of Thailand’s habitual displays of  defiance is something to behold.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most vocal Western corporate-financier critic of Thailand is the <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/17928993">Economist</a>. It openly criticizes the King’s self-sufficiency economy in an article titled “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/8521976?story_id=8521976%20Rebranding%20Thaksinomics">Rebranding Thaksinomics.</a>”  It states that the economic plan is “a partial retreat from Thailand’s  hitherto liberal economic stance.” The Economist muddles the debate by  side-stepping the self-sufficient aspects of  the”self-sufficiency  economy.” It claims that socialist handouts under deposed Prime Minister  and <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/?p=11879">documented Western proxy</a> Thaksin Shinawatra somehow accomplished  the exact same goals. The Economist also claims the concept of  self-sufficiency is merely a “rebranding” of such socialist handouts.</p>
<p>The  Economist article then breaks down into a pro-Thaksin rant, decrying  his ousting from power and continued claims that somehow encouraging  people to grow their own food is a theft of Thaksin’s socialist/populist  policies.</p>
<p>It should be noted <a href="http://landdestroyer.blogspot.com/2011/04/free-markets-socialism-alternative-view.html">that permanent socialism</a> is not  self-sufficiency. It is complete dependency on the state and on people  who pay their ever increasing taxes. Socialism is not about growing your  own garden, using technology to enhance your independence or solving  your problems with your own resources. It is about taking from the  collective storehouses of the state, and when you are again hungry,  taking again. Socialism could only be very useful as a stop-gap measure  between current problems and the active pursuit of permanent technical solutions.  However, the goal of globalization is to create interdependency between  states, and total dependency on global institutions, therefore,  perpetuating problems, not solving them becomes the equation.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/aquaponics4you.html" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/_qLAIskTQXUc/TaemSXkVyTI/AAAAAAAAIO4/OgC4Xl8bNd0/ad2.jpg"></a>Another Western pro-corporate-financier point-of-view comes from Australia’s National University’s  “New Mandala” blog written by academic wonk Andrew Walker. The blog  itself is a clearinghouse for corporate subsidized talking points regarding  Southeast Asia and is tied to the <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/?p=18201">corporate-financier funded Lowy Institute</a>. Some “<a href="http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/newmandala/2010/08/06/robert-amsterdam-on-a-strategy-of-tension-in-bangkok-2/">contributing writers</a>” even include  Thaksin Shinawatra’s hired lobbyist, <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/?p=21259">Robert Amsterdam</a>.</p>
<p>Walker’s  entire perception of Thailand seems to be derived from his time spent  in a single village in Northern Thailand.</p>
<p>From his myopic point-of-view  in the minute village of “Baan Tian,” he condemns entirely Thailand’s  self-sufficiency economy in his article “<a href="http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/newmandala/2008/01/28/royal-misrepresentation-of-rural-livelihoods/">Royal misrepresentation of rural livelihoods.</a>” He suggests that “the sufficiency economy prescriptions for rural development are inappropriate and disempowering.”</p>
<p>As  with the Economist, the article breaks down into a pro-Thaksin rant  claiming the entire plan is meant to keep the rural population of  Thailand in their place, out of the cities, and thus out of the debate  of national issues.</p>
<p>Of course, becoming self-sufficient is one  step on the road to real empowerment. Academic wonks like Andrew Walker  presume the height of empowerment is feeding a paper voting stub into a  box, on your way home from a service sector job, and then relaxing  behind the glow of a new plasma screen TV bought on credit. A more  likely argument would be that sustaining your own existence, wrought  from the land beneath your feet, and the ability to shape the world  around you with an understanding of science and the mastery of multiple  trades is the height of empowerment and the truest form of human  freedom.</p>
<p>The hand wringing within the writings of the Economist  and ANU’s Andrew Walker is not the full extent of the West’s   reaction to Thailand and its wandering from foreign dominion. A full   fledged “<a href="http://landdestroyer.blogspot.com/2012/04/bizarre-us-backed-cult-on-pilgrimage-to.html">red” color revolution</a> has been brewing within the Kingdom since   at least 2009. Reading the “Red Siam Manifesto” penned by “red shirt”   intelligentsia Giles Ungpakorn makes it quite clear how they view   “self-sufficiency” and the need to “reform” Thailand as a “socialist   welfare state.” </p>
<p>Ungpakorn’s childish and ranting manifesto can be found on “<a href="http://www.socialistworker.co.uk/art.php?id=17074">Socialist Worker Online” here</a>. A complete selection of the “red shirt” propaganda used within Thailand <a href="http://2bangkok.com/category/thai-politics/red-shirt-publications">can be found here</a>.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the leader of the “red shirt” protest is deposed  ex-PM Thaksin Shinawatra. Long before Thaksin Shinwatra would become  prime minister in Thailand,  he was already working his way up the Wall Street-London ladder of  opportunity, while simultaneously working his way up in Thai politics.  He was <a href="http://thanong.tripod.com/03072001.htm">appointed by the Carlyle Group as an adviser</a>,  while holding public office, and attempted to use his connections to  boost his political image. Thanong Khanthong of Thailand’s English  newspaper “the Nation,” <a href="http://thanong.tripod.com/03072001.htm">wrote in 2001</a>: </p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

In April 1998, while Thailand was still mired in a deep economic morass,          Thaksin tried to use his American connections to boost his political image          just as he was forming his Thai Rak Thai Party. He invited Bush senior          to visit Bangkok and his home, saying his own mission was to act as a ‘national matchmaker’ between the US equity fund and Thai businesses.          In March, he also played host to James Baker III, the US secretary of          state in the senior Bush administration, on his sojourn in Thailand. </p>

<p>The key to stopping these foreign interests dead in  their tracks is  seizing back from them the mechanisms of civilization –  and we have  done that already in terms of the alternative media. Such  success is  necessary in all aspects of our life, and as the King in  Thailand  suggests, it can start with something as simple as growing  your own garden.</p>
<p>Today and Into the Future</p>
<p>Of  course in Thailand, agricultural self-sufficiency is coupled with  technology to enhance efficiency and improve the quality of life. Even  in the city, small independent businesses are adopting the latest  technology to improve their production, increase their profits, and even  out-compete larger corporations. Computer controlled machining  equipment can be found in small workshops crammed into old shop-houses,  automatic embroidering machines allow a single woman to fulfill orders  for name tags on new school uniforms – rather than both businesses  sending off orders to factories owned by a handful of wealthy investors.  A multitude of examples can be seen walking around any city block in  Thailand’s capital of Bangkok.</p>

<p>
Bringing  this sort of technology to rural people, even enabling people to create  their own technology rather than just employ it, is not just science  fiction but is a reality of today. MIT Professor  Dr. Neil Gershenfeld  has developed the “fabrication laboratory” or “Fab Lab.” The Fab Lab is a  microfactory that can “make almost anything.” His Fab Lab has since  been replicated all over the world in what he calls the personal  fabrication revolution. It aims at turning a world of dependent  consumers into independent designers and producers.</p>
</p>
<div style="text-align: left">
<b>Video</b>: Dr. Neil Gershenfeld presents his Fab Lab at TED. </div>
<p>
Dr.  Gershenfeld in his own words articulates the problem of finding support  amongst  institutions and governments, stating that individuals are  very enthusiastic about this revolution “but it breaks their  organizational boundaries. In fact it is illegal for them, in many  cases, to equip ordinary people to create rather than consume  technology.”</p>
<p>This indeed not only encapsulates Dr. Gershenfeld’s  dilemma, but describes to a “t” the mentality of oligarchs and the fears  they harbor about empowering the people, a fear reflected in the  “organizational boundaries” of their corporations and governmental  institutions. This is a feature of oligarchy described as early as 300  B.C.  in ancient Greece in “<a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0158&amp;redirect=true">The Athenian Constitution.</a>”  In it, a character referred to as “the Old Oligarch” describes his  contempt for the social mobility the technology of the Athenian navy  affords the lower echelons of Athenian society.</p>
<p>Dr. Gershenfeld  goes on to encapsulate the true potential of his Fab Labs by stating,  “the other 5 billion people on the planet aren’t just technical “sinks,”  they are “sources.” The real opportunity is to harness the inventive  power of the world to locally design and produce solutions to local  problems.” Dr. Gershenfeld concludes by conceding he thought such a  possibility was 20 years off, but “it’s where we are today,” noting the  success his Fab Labs are already having around the world.</p>

Dr.  Gershenfeld’s message resonates with the current culture of Thailand  and the ambitions of the “self-sufficiency economy.” In many ways,  Thailand’s patchwork of micro-businesses, already successfully  by-passing capital intensive centralized production, vindicates the work  and optimism of Dr. Gershenfeld. It also, however, resonates strongly  with the self-reliant traditions that had made America great. The  technical possibility for this to change the world is already a reality,  but Dr. Gershenfeld himself concedes that the biggest obstacle is  overcoming social engineering – in other words – creating a paradigm  shift in the minds of the population to meet the technical paradigm  shift that has already taken place.</p>
<p>Self-sufficiency and the  harnessing of technology in the hands of the people are the greatest  fears of the corporate-financier oligarchy – fears that oligarchs throughout the  centuries have harbored. Simply boycotting multinational corporations  and replacing them with local solutions is something everyone can afford  to do starting today. And by simply looking into Dr. Neil Gershenfeld’s  “Fab Lab,” similar ideas such as “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace">hackerspaces</a>,” raising awareness of the personal fabrication revolution,  and even in the smallest way participating can help overcome the  obstacle of social-engineering and spur a profound paradigm shift. We  have begun to seize back the media, now it is time to seize back the  other levers of power. Now is the time to recognize true freedom as  being self-sufficient as a nation, as a community, and as a household,  and start living it everyday.</p>

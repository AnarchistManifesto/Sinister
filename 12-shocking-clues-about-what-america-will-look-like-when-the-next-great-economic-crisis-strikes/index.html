<b><a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2013/10/12-shocking-clues-about-what-america.html">Activist Post</a></b></p>
<p>The collapse of American society is accelerating. For the moment,  much of our social decay is being masked by the tremendous level of  affluence that we are experiencing. It <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/07/28/americans-poverty-no-work/2594203/" target="_blank" title="has been reported">has been reported</a>  that 4 out of every 5 adults in the United States “struggle with  joblessness, near-poverty or reliance on welfare for at least parts of  their lives”, but in general Americans still enjoy a debt-fueled  standard of living that is far beyond what most of the rest of the world  enjoys. When that debt-fueled standard of living permanently  disappears, it is going to unleash chaos unlike anything that America  has ever seen before.</p>
<p>Right now, economic conditions in this country  are not anywhere close to where they were <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/40-stats-that-prove-the-u-s-economy-has-already-been-collapsing-over-the-past-decade" title="before 2008">before 2008</a>,  but this is just the beginning. We are in the midst of an ongoing  economic collapse which is going to get much, much worse in the years  ahead. When the next major wave of the economic crisis strikes,  millions of people are going to become extremely desperate. And  desperate people do desperate things. We are already starting to see  this play out all over the nation, but this is only a preview of coming  attractions. What we are going to witness in future years is going to  be almost too horrible for words.</p>
<p>So how can I be so sure that this is going to happen? After all, the  United States didn’t descend into complete and utter chaos during the  Great Depression of the 1930s.  Wouldn’t an economic depression unfold  in a similar manner today?</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>Unfortunately, a lot has changed since then.  A lot more Americans  were self-sufficient back in those days, and the truth is that the  character of our nation has been rotting and decaying for decades.  In a  <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/34-signs-that-america-is-in-decline" title="previous article">previous article</a>, I described it this way…</p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>We are simply not the same country that we used to be.   Americans are proud, selfish, greedy, arrogant, ungrateful, treacherous  and completely addicted to entertainment and pleasure.  Our country is  literally falling apart all around us, but most Americans are so plugged  into entertainment that they can’t even be bothered to notice what is  happening.</p>

Just last weekend, there were “<a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/the-coming-food-stamp-riots" title="mini-riots">mini-riots</a>” in several U.S. states when “technical issues” caused the food stamp system to go haywire for a few hours.</p>
<p>What would have happened if there had been an extended outage or if  the political crisis in D.C. had caused food stamps to be completely cut  off at some point in November?</p>
<p>Let’s be thankful that we did not have to find out.</p>
<p>But even though major food stamps riots may have been averted (at  least for now), there are a whole host of other signs that America is  going to become a very unstable place during the next major economic  downturn.  The following are 12 shocking clues about what America will  look like when the next great economic crisis strikes…</p>
<p><strong>#1</strong> Would you continue to work as a bus driver if you  were stabbed while driving or if a passenger poured urine all over  you?  Just check out what has been going on <a href="http://www.wxyz.com/dpp/news/stabbings-lead-detroit-bus-drivers-ready-to-protest-monday-urge-riders-to-seek-other-transportation" target="_blank" title="in Detroit lately">in Detroit lately</a>…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After two drivers were recently stabbed and another had  urine poured on her by an angry rider, union officials representing bus  drivers for the city of Detroit are set to protest in front of city hall  at 10 a.m. on Monday.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/ultimatesurvivalplan.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-CTsdDqKcvhI/T7GjToaksaI/AAAAAAAAO2s/8vEb9HmqOhk/s316/160x316.gif"></a><strong>#2</strong> We are starting to see a lot of “group crimes” happen all over America.  For example, just the other day <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/brooklyn-youths-attack-couple-racial-attack-cops-article-1.1490901" target="_blank" title="in Brooklyn, New York">in Brooklyn, New York</a> a gang of 10 young thugs dragged a young couple out of their vehicle and brutally beat them…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ronald Russo was dragged to the ground. Then he was  punched and kicked in the head. He felt more blows all over his body,  investigators said. He suffered a fractured nose, a broken septum, a  blood clot and abrasions to his shoulder. He was treated and released  from Beth Israel Medical Center. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In the midst of the attack, there was a steady chorus of epithets.  “White motherf—–!” screamed the attackers, who ranged in age from 12  to 18. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div class="ym-inline">Alanna Russo, 30, was calling 911 when the  12-year-old girl pulled the woman’s hair and threw her to the ground.  The victim’s head slammed into the concrete. She suffered a black eye,  bleeding and difficulty breathing, prosecutors said, but she refused  medical attention.</div>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>#3</strong> A lot of people assume that they are perfectly safe inside their own vehicles but that is not the case at all.  A story in <a href="http://nypost.com/2013/09/30/bikers-attack-suv-after-driver-rams-riders/" target="_blank" title="the New York Post">the New York Post</a>  about a gang of bikers that ruthlessly hunted down a young family that  was driving an SUV made national headlines a few weeks ago…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A gang of bikers terrorized a dad driving with his wife  and baby daughter on the West Side Highway — chasing after their SUV and  then dragging the man out and beating him to a pulp in front of his  horrified family, authorities said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the bikers caught up with this family they showed the father of the baby daughter absolutely no mercy…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One biker can be seen on the video ripping off his helmet and using it to bash in Lien’s driver’s-side window. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The crew pummeled Lien on the pavement in front of his wife, Rosalyn Ng, and their 2-year-old daughter, police sources said. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>

<p><strong>#4</strong> We are living at a time when hearts are becoming  very cold.  Some Americans are becoming so desperate for money that they  will do almost anything to get it.  In fact, one couple in Tennessee  has actually been charged with selling their four daughters <a href="http://www.wate.com/story/23727507/johnson-city-couple-waives-hearing-in-child-selling-case" target="_blank" title="for use in sex films">for use in sex films</a>…</p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>An East Tennessee couple is facing a list of charges, accused of selling their children to take part in sex films. </p>

<p>Connie Sue McCall, 40, and her husband, Ronnie Lee McCall, 61, of Johnson City have been charged by a federal grand jury. </p>

<p>Paperwork shows the couple was selling their four daughters. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Prosecutors say the four girls were between the ages of 5 and 16 when this happened.</p>

<p>Could you imagine such a thing happening in your neighborhood?</p>
<p>Perhaps it is happening, but you just don’t know that it is going on.</p>
<p><strong>#5</strong> And it is not only older people that are having  their hearts grow cold.  It is happening to young people too.  Last  week, a 17-year-old girl was caught carrying around a dead baby (which  she probably gave birth to) in a shopping bag in a Victoria’s Secret  store <a href="http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2013/10/18/gut-wrenching-update-in-case-of-teen-girl-carrying-dead-baby-in-shopping-bag-at-ny-victorias-secret/" target="_blank" title="right in the heart of Manhattan">right in the heart of Manhattan</a>…</p>

<div>Police believe 17-year-old Tiana  Rodriguez gave birth to the baby at a friend’s house and that the infant  was later asphyxiated. However, the city medical examiner’s office said  an autopsy was inconclusive, and more tests were needed.</div>

<div>Who does something like that?</div>

<strong>#6</strong> Sadly, a lot of  mothers appear to be losing the natural affection that they should have  for their children.  Just check out another incident that happened <a href="http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20131016/financial-district/mom-stealing-candy-from-drugstore-leaves-baby-behind-police-say" target="_blank" title="in New York City recently">in New York City recently</a>…</div>

<strong>#7</strong> One of the  clearest signs that American society is decaying is the fact that groups  of kids are banding together and agreeing to commit absolutely horrible  crimes.  We have seen this with the “flash mob” robberies that are  plaguing many cities, but what is even worse is when groups of kids band  together to commit violent acts.  <a href="http://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2013/10/16/exclusive-15-year-old-girl-attacked-by-group-of-teens-in-delaware-county/" target="_blank" title="In Pennsylvania recently">In Pennsylvania recently</a>, a group of teens cheered on attackers as they beat up a 15-year-old girl…</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Speaking exclusively to CBS 3, a  15-year-old high school student, whose identity we are concealing,  described a terrifying attack by a gang of at least nine teenage boys as  she was leaving an Interboro High School football game Monday night. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The teenage victim described first being taunted by the attackers,  who followed her down a neighborhood street, cursing and spitting at  her, before she was repeatedly kicked and punched, suffering at least  one blow to her head.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The attackers even tried to throw her in front of a passing vehicle and nobody tried to stop them…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The victim says as at least two of the teenagers pummeled  her, the others cheered them on shouting, “Come on, let’s get her!” At  one point, the victim says, the gang tried to throw her under the wheels  of a passing car, which swerved, narrowly missing her.</p>
</blockquote>
<div>What is happening to this country?</div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
<strong>#8</strong> We have also been hearing about a lot of “gang rapes” lately as well.  The following is <a href="http://www.xojane.com/it-happened-to-me/daisy-coleman-maryville-rape" target="_blank" title="an excerpt">an excerpt</a> from a first-hand account from a 14-year-old girl in Missouri that experienced this type of horrible ordeal…</div>
<blockquote>
<p>About five shots tall, I drank it. I guess I didn’t know how badly it would mess me up. But the boys who gave it to me did. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Then it was like I fell into a dark abyss. No light anywhere. Just  dark, dense silence — and cold. That’s all I could ever remember from  that night. Apparently, I was there for not even an entire hour before  they discarded me in the snow.</p>

<p>Are you starting to understand why I am so convinced that we have a major problem with our young men in America today?</p>
<p>Instead of raising young gentlemen, we are raising wild animals that seem to have very little self-control.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/familysurvival.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ASIFGy_z7zU/UCFiDQK8GBI/AAAAAAAAROU/7AHejVY_hUE/s202/3.gif"></a><strong>#9</strong> And sometimes the public does not do anything to stop sexual assaults even when they happen on public streets.  <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2462551/Passersbys-photos-videos-woman-raped-sidewalk-Ohio.html" target="_blank" title="In a recent incident in Athens, Ohio">In a recent incident in Athens, Ohio</a>,  not only did the public not stop a sexual assault, many actually took  photos of the assault and posted them on social media websites…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Horrific photos of an alleged rape in progress have been  shared on social media after crowds at a college homecoming celebration  chose to take pictures and videos of the sex act rather than stopping  it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Would such a thing have happened in our country 50 years ago?</p>
<p>Of course not.</p>
<p>We need to come to grips with how far we have fallen.</p>
<p><strong>#10</strong> In America today, young kids can beat a homeless  man to death and it barely even makes a blip on the news.  I’ll bet  hardly any of you have heard about what happened recently to <a href="http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/09/21/prosecutor-3-teens-charged-in-beating-death-of-homeless-man-in-n-j/" target="_blank" title="a homeless man in New Jersey">a homeless man in New Jersey</a>…</p>

<p>As CBS 2’s Janelle Burrell reported, Hudson County Acting Prosecutor  Gaetano T. Gregory said two 13-year-olds and a 14-year-old were charged  in the Sept. 10 death of Ralph Eric Santiago, 46.</p>
<p>What would cause 13-year-olds and 14-year-olds to behave so savagely?</p>
<p>Could it be because we are raising them in a society where basic morality is not taught any longer?</p>
<p><strong>#11</strong> Our young people certainly do not have much  respect for the very elderly anymore either. Instead, the elderly are  looked at as “weak” and “easy prey”.  Just check out what recently  happened to a <a href="http://www.9wsyr.com/mostpopular/story/70-year-old-man-suffers-serious-injuries-after/zZNgWaSsaEW5Hy3CEV0z0Q.cspx" target="_blank" title="70-year-old man">70-year-old man</a> in upstate New York…</p>

<p>A 70-year-old man was seriously injured early Saturday morning after being attacked outside of a 7-Eleven in Syracuse. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Police say James Gifford had just left the store at the intersection  of Valley Drive and South Street just after 6:00 a.m. and was attacked  by a group of five or six black males, according to Syracuse Police. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Police also said this appears to be an unprovoked incident with an innocent victim.</p>

<p><strong>#12</strong> In this day and age, it is very hard to tell who  you can trust.  You might meet someone on the street and they might  smile and seem very nice, but inside they may be full of all kinds of  garbage.</p>
<p>For example, just check out what one man in the Boston area <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2013/09/12/justice/cannibal-eat-children-case/index.html?hpt=hp_t3" target="_blank" title="planned to do">planned to do</a>…</p>

<p>This is how twisted and perverted our society has become.</p>
<p>A lot of Americans believe that if we could just elect “the right  politicians” or if we could just change our economic system or if we  could just fix one particular issue that everything would be right in  America again.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, what we are facing is not so simple.  Our problems are  not just in Washington D.C. or on Wall Street.  The truth is that our  biggest problem is what is going on inside of us.</p>
<p>America is rotting and decaying on the inside, and the next great  economic crisis is going to reveal just how bad things have gotten.</p>

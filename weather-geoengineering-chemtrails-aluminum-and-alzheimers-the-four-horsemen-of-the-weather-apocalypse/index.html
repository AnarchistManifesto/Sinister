Frompovich</p>
<p>J. Marvin Herndon (born 1944) is an American interdisciplinary scientist, who earned his BA degree in physics in 1970 from the University of California, San Diego and his Ph.D. degree in nuclear chemistry in 1974 from Texas A&amp;M University. For three years, J. Marvin Herndon was a post-doctoral assistant to Hans Suess and Harold C. Urey in geochemistry and cosmochemistry at the University of California, San Diego. He is the President of Transdyne Corporation in San Diego, California. A listing of more than a dozen of his peer-reviewed papers can be found on Dr. Henrdon’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Marvin_Herndon"><i>Wikipedia</i> page</a>.  January 20, 2015, Dr. Herndon published his concerns about weather geoengineering on GeoengineeringWatch.org’s website. [1]</p>
<p>After reading Dr. Herndon’s June 2015 article, <a href="https://chemtrailsplanet.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/aluminum-poisoning-of-humanity-and-earth_s-biota-by-clandestine-geoengineering-activity-implications-for-india.pdf">“Aluminum poisoning of humanity and Earth’s biota by clandestine geoengineering activity: implications for India,”</a> [<i>Current Science</i>, Vol. 108, No. 12, 25 June 2015, 2173-2176] I just had to interview him, since what he discussed needs to be mainstreamed globally—something the controlled media and vested interests are discouraging, and even preventing. So, following is my extensive interview with Dr. Herndon.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><i><b>What is the most important significance of your recently published scientific paper? </b></i></p>
<p>1) It provides scientific identification, evidence that can be taken into courts of law; 2) it shows the horrific public health consequences of coal fly ash aerosol dispersion; 3) it shows the scientific community that ignored the whole matter to be institutionally corrupt; 4) it debilitates those who would say there’s nothing to the particulate trails because, if there were, the scientists would have investigated it and not a single scientific paper on the subject has been published (before mine, that is).</p>
<p><i><b>What prompted you to investigate or get involved with aluminum issues as being tied in to weather geoengineering? </b></i></p>
<p>In the Spring of 2014, I began to see particulate trails across the sky that were increasing in frequency and in intensity. By November 2014 the spraying was taking place on a near daily basis sometimes obscuring the otherwise blue sky with dark artificial clouds. I got involved to use my training as a scientist to discover what material was being placed in the air that I, my family, and the citizens of San Diego are being forced to breathe. I did that, and the first scientific paper on the subject was just published. Subsequently, I have collected my own rainwater samples, had them analyzed and discovered some really important measurements that someone made in 2011. In addition to aluminum, there are a whole host of toxic chemicals that come out of coal fly ash. I’ve written this as a new paper and submitted it for publication. Basically, the new paper confirms, with great certainty, the results of the just-published paper and addresses major public health issues related to the ongoing spraying of coal fly ash into the troposphere. I first submitted that paper to a journal called <i>Environmental Health Perspectives</i>, which is published by one of the US National Institutes of Health. The paper was rejected immediately without review and, despite my appeals, was rejected with finality. What does this say? It says that the US National Institutes of Health, whose mandate is to protect and improve public health, acts contrary to that mandate and hides the identity of the toxic material as coal fly ash, and hides the associated health risks from members of the scientific community and from ordinary citizens. US National Institutes of Health is, in my view, complicit in an activity that I allege constitutes crimes against humanity.</p>

<p><i><b>Climate change apparently began with the UN’s 1988 report. Why do you think the UN went out on a limb like that? </b></i></p>
<p>There are three reasons: money, power and control. Many in the UN thought that countries that produce large amounts of carbon dioxide could be forced to pay poorer countries through some mechanism such as carbon credits. Initially, this was all about transferring money from richer nations to poorer nations. I suspect that the UN would like to run all of the geoengineering activities. What a frightening thought! What the IPCC does is to evaluate various people’s climate models. Models are not science. Models are computer programs subject to the well-known dictum “garbage in, garbage out.” So, you have a committee deciding on which models are more likely to be correct and assigning a probability. That’s nonsense. The real problem is that the scientific community, the so-called establishment, has sold-out. They no longer act as scientists. In all of the years that people have observed particulate trails, how many university scientists have investigated those? None! Or at least no one has published a scientific article on the subject until I did recently. That is shameful behavior for the scientific community, but it’s all about money, power and control. I suspect there are sympathetic scientists out there, but they are too afraid to stand up and act like scientists on the matter. If they did, they would be “excommunicated,” lose their grants, lose opportunities for promotion and, perhaps, lose their jobs. Practically everyone involved in geoengineering, and climate control and related activities, does so for the same three reasons: money, power and control.</p>
<p><i><b>In 2008, you wrote the paper “Variables unaccounted for in global warming and climate change models,” which was published in the Sept. 2008 issue of </b></i><b>Current Science</b><i><b>, wherein you claim political, financial, and self-aggrandizement interests were the “spawning” mechanism for the idea of anthropogenic global warming/climate change, which took hold, especially with media mainstreaming. Why do you think that concept or paradigm had to be invented? Do you think any political “payback” came into play, since Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore lost to Republican George W Bush? Or, are both on the same geoengineering wavelength? </b></i></p>
<p>I would say that both parties are on the climate change/geoengineering gravy train.</p>
<p><i><b>In that paper you claim there is another explanation other than human activity. Will you please tell us what you think it is, and how you came to that conclusion? </b></i></p>
<p>This is actually a long story that the reader might like to investigate on my website <a href="http://nuclearplanet.com/">NuclearPlanet.com</a>. The story begins in 1979 when I realized that the inner core of the Earth might have a different composition than had been thought for 40 years. My paper on the subject was published in the <i>Proceedings of the Royal Society London</i> in 1979. While I was awaiting publication, I thought that there would be debate and discussion (as there should be), and that people who had well-funded laboratories would take the idea and run with it, leaving me in the dust. That did not happen. Instead, it was as if the paper had never been published. It was completely ignored, my renewal grants encountered problems, I was “excommunicated” and out of the academic business. But, I was onto something important and kept pursuing the matter on my own and making one discovery after another. Eventually, I came to understand that when the Earth formed initially, it formed as a gas giant planet, like Jupiter, with the rocky part crushed by about 300 Earth-masses of gas and ice. When the sun ignited, the super intense solar wind stripped the gases from our planet leaving a compressed rocky planet without ocean basins. Over time, pressures built and the earth began to decompress. This potentially variable decompression is responsible for the surface geology, for emplacing heat at the base of the crust, and is the driving force for earthquakes. There is geological evidence to support variable heat output from the Earth. There is also evidence that the Sun’s output is not constant. Yet these two powerful energy sources are assumed constant in climate models.</p>
<p><b><i>If, as you state in your June 2015 paper, “Aluminum poisoning of humanity and Earth’s biota by clandestine geoengineering activity: implications for India,” [</i>Current Science<i>, Vol. 108, No. 12, 25 June 2015, 2173-2176] the idea for geoengineering apparently came from observations of major volcanic eruptions and that their ash remains in the upper atmosphere (stratosphere) for close to a year, what do you think, then, was the real incentive for weather geoengineering and why? </i></b></p>
<p>Initially, weather geoengineering was meant to benefit agriculture, but later it became weaponized for military purposes. Then along came global warming with all the political and financial benefits.</p>
<p><i><b>If weather geoengineering has been going on for a while, why do you think it’s been ratcheted up dramatically since 2013? Coincidentally, USA weather patterns since 2013 have been dramatic, especially East coast winters! Any comment about that? </b></i></p>
<p><a style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em" href="http://activistpost.net/teslasecret/" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_qLAIskTQXUc/TXghL_ldW7I/AAAAAAAAHbw/9kd3emt_f2g/teslanew.gif" alt=""></a>“Why” is the big question! Unlike the geoengineering academics talk about, i.e., spraying particles into the upper atmosphere (stratosphere), the ongoing covert geoengineering sprays coal fly ash into the troposphere, the lower atmosphere, which mixes with the air people breathe. The particles do not remain suspended in the lower atmosphere for long periods of time as they do in the upper atmosphere, so spraying has to be done on a daily basis. If the spraying of coal fly ash into the troposphere is being done to counteract global warming, it is a questionable practice. The artificial clouds may block sunlight during the day, but at night those same clouds keep heat from leaving the Earth. Moreover, dispersed particulates pose the impediment to rainfall which operates counter to cooling the Earth. Coal fly ash does that plus something even worse: it absorbs water, so it changes the natural rainfall patterns. So one must wonder, is the intention to combat global warming or to cause global warming so as to melt the Arctic ice to get at the oil beneath. In either case, the consequence on humans and Earth’s biota [ecology] is horrific.</p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p><i><b>Weather geoengineering can be seen in the skies in the form of airplane exhausts that widen to form what I call “blanket clouds,” which can cause a cloud cover over a perfectly cloudless blue sky within an hour or so. We know that they are not jet engine exhausts, since it’s almost impossible for modern jet engines to create what are called contrails. Some real contrails can occur when atmospheric conditions are correct at higher altitudes. They dissipate within a minute or so, and do not spread out to create an artificial cloud cover. However, the sky trails, referred to colloquially as “chemtrails,” are created at lower atmospheric levels by deliberately spraying “stuff” into the air. Can you please tell us what that “stuff” is? </b></i></p>
<p>The “stuff,” as I discovered scientifically, is coal combustion fly ash. When utilities burn coal to produce electricity, two kinds of ash are formed: heavy ash that settles out and fly ash that would go up the smoke-stack unless it is trapped with electrostatic precipitators, as now required by Western governments because coal fly ash contains impurities that were in the coal, but in concentrated form in the fly ash. These toxic impurities are readily leached, that is, extracted into water. That is one reason why this substance is such an environmental hazard.</p>
<p><i><b>Can you explain why coal fly ash is used as the principal ingredient? If it’s an industrial byproduct from the coal burning power producing plants globally, is weather geoengineering a disposal means for a hazardous waste, similar to fluoridation of water supplies for aluminum wastes and the fertilizer industry? </b></i></p>
<p>1) the particle size is ideal; 2) it’s an industrial waste product that’s available worldwide on a huge scale; 3) it’s cheap because utilities would have to pay the costs of securing the product from the environment; 4) the utilities already have in place the production facilities and transportation network, out of public view. But using coal fly ash has serious, deleterious consequences for human health, Earth’s biota [ecology], and natural weather processes. Moreover, its utility is limited unless its purpose is to cause drought. [<i>I find it rather interesting that you should say that!</i>]</p>
<p><b><i>In your paper you state that coal fly ash from different European power plants was analyzed and also exposed to water for 24 hours, and then the water was analyzed. Some pretty dangerous elements were found in the water that had been extracted from the coal fly ash, e.g., radioactive uranium and thorium, aluminum, barium and strontium! Coincidentally, those very elements have been identified in rain water samples collected. Please expound upon what that means for human health, the Earth’s biota, and possible species extinction(s). </i></b></p>
<p>In a word: Horrific. My just-submitted paper deals with the subject, so, to prevent compromising its publication, let’s wait until after it is published.</p>
<p><b><i>Absolutely! However, I’d really love to interview you about it as soon as possible after publication. I guess my next question apparently is moot at this point: What are the negative aspects and effects of coal fly ash and the elements found in it? I guess I’ll just have to wait for the answer in the published paper. </i></b></p>
<p><i><b>Are there any health risks to what’s being sprayed? Who are the most vulnerable? </b></i></p>
<p>In the just-published paper, I discussed the health risks of aluminum in a chemically mobile state as relates to neurological disorders. The most vulnerable are the children [fetuses] pregnant women are carrying, children, the elderly, and those with compromised immune and respiratory systems. There is much more information in my just-submitted paper.</p>
<p><i><b>Do you think chemtrail particulates contribute to the dramatic rise in asthma and lung disease, plus Alzheimer’s and other dementias? Are there any other health problems that can be attributed to or associated with “chemtrails” or coal fly ash? </b></i></p>
<p>Yes, and if correct, there will be a big spike in their occurrence in the USA after January 20, 2013.</p>
<p><i><b>Can you explain what’s being found in rain water assays in Europe? Have similar rain water assays been done in the USA, especially in California? Do you know of any areas assayed in the USA? </b></i></p>
<p>Most of the post-spraying rainwater analyses are done for aluminum and barium; occasionally strontium analyses are requested. The problem is that, comparatively speaking, there have been relatively few chemical analyses worldwide. The reason is because there is no well-funded research program on the subject, so individuals typically collect the samples and pay for the analyses from commercial labs out of their own pockets. Generally speaking, rainwater analyses for the above three elements are similar throughout the world where such measurements have been made. Regrettably, as can be seen from my recently published paper, there are comparatively few data points.</p>
<p><i><b>Apparently then, rain water assays performed in both the USA and Europe produced similar results, as those done elsewhere in the world. I find that not only interesting, but rather incriminating. </b></i><br />
<i><b><br />
</b></i> <i><b>As an aside, what do you think the “geopolitical” reason is for creating a deliberate drought in California, which is the premiere fresh food producing state in the USA? </b></i></p>
<p>That’s a good question, but an unanswerable question. It’s hard to believe that those who ordered the spraying are unaware of the drought potential. It would make a lot more sense, if it were the case that ISIS ordered the spraying. Do our officials hate America enough to destroy the potential for food production in its most important agricultural state? The problem with covert operations is not knowing the intent. There may be several agendas in play here.</p>
<p><i><b>I’d venture to say that there may be vested interests at work to create “water wars” that would lead to water use taxes, similar to the much-ballyhooed “carbon taxes.” </b></i></p>
<p><i><b>In your paper you mention that in one area of Northern California, after an electrical storm, rainwater was collected, which contained 3,450 μg/l of aluminum when compared with a sampling of 10 days earlier that yielded 850 μg/l of aluminum. Those are dramatic figures, especially after the electrical storm. What do you think contributed to such a huge difference? </b></i></p>
<p>I do not know what might have contributed to such a huge difference. As the three elements “fingerprint” were not measured, nothing can be said as to what the source of aluminum was in that instance.</p>
<p><i><b>Can you please talk about why the federal or states governments aren’t doing anything about analyzing rainwater and publishing results? Can the answer be similar as to why radiation measuring devices in California were turned off after Fukushima? </b></i></p>
<p>The quick answer is that they are all “in the tank.” The EPA was supposed to certify coal fly ash as a hazardous material, but surprisingly did not. Moreover, the allowable limit for aluminum in drinking water was raised significantly. And, as I described above, the US National Institutes of Health rejected the opportunity to advise the scientific community and others of the identity and public health risks of aerosolized coal fly ash.</p>
<p><i><b>Do you think coal fly ash has been sprayed for close to 15 years in the USA, and what does that mean for agricultural and drinking water quality; agricultural soils and food crops uptake of aluminum, which should not be an element in food crops; and ambient outdoor air quality? </b></i></p>
<p>I have one analysis of rainwater from 2002 showing the three element fingerprint of coal fly ash. Chemically mobile aluminum has deleterious effects on plant growth. Aluminum corrupts the soil and damages plants. But of all of the consequences, I suspect the worst is on humans, who have breathed coal fly ash for years.</p>
<p><i><b>As an aside, I’m a retired natural nutritionist and I never remember learning, or reading, about aluminum as a “nutrient” in food crops. Caution about aluminum cookware has been known for years, since acid/alkaline balance transfers come into play during cooking with aluminum cookware. </b></i></p>
<p><i><b>You state that weather geoengineering is “clandestine.” How can that be, when its effects are in plain sight above our heads daily? Who is doing the spraying? I understand there are airlines devoted to doing just that on a global basis, plus U.S. military planes, and those planes do not file flight plans and at times have almost caused accidents with commercial airliners. </b></i></p>
<p>Even when visible overhead, the operation is clandestine or covert when specific information is withheld, especially the chemical composition, the purpose, the public health consequences, etc. and there exists in its place, an organized pattern of disinformation.</p>
<p><i><b>One of the most disturbing facts you point out in your article is that weather geoengineering—especially the aluminum associated with it—is associated with neurological diseases including autism, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, ADHD, and others. Additionally, that humans have not evolved with a natural immunity to aluminum. Of course we haven’t, because most of the aluminum was found embedded in the earth’s crust and not available to humans in “free form” in the air we breathe, the water we drink or the food we eat. </b></i><br />
<i><b><br />
</b></i> <i><b>In your paper, you mention that in the Ganga Alluvial Plain of India, seasonal rainfall delivers toxic quantities of aluminum to the Gomati River Basin. Also, you question where it’s coming from and also how to determine the source. Can you please expound upon your theory and what it would prove? </b></i></p>
<p><a style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em" href="http://activistpost.net/miraclecure.html" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/300x250.gif" alt=""></a>As you state above, aluminum is securely locked up in silicate compounds. Thus, neither the plants nor creatures of Earth developed any defense mechanism for chemically mobile aluminum. The Gomati River is a tributary to the Ganga River, or Ganges as we call it. The Ganga River is extremely important to the people in India. With all of the sources of its pollution, the ritual bathing that takes place is in relative safety. Apparently, there are organisms that cleanse the river. If mobile aluminum were to destroy those organisms, it would cause a massive problem.</p>
<p>I proposed that Indians conduct experiments to determine whether other countries’ coal fly ash geoengineering is causing the high levels of mobile aluminum, or is it a consequence of India’s coal burning power plants that do not sequester coal fly ash.</p>
<p><i><b>India has an Alzheimer’s disease problem, as do many countries of the world. According to this, <a href="http://www.alzheimerindia.org/alzheimers-in-india/">“Alzheimer’s in India is quickly becoming more and more common…”</a> According to <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23287326">a paper published in 2012</a>, southern India has a much higher rate of Alzheimer’s than rural northern India. What prompted your interest in India’s Alzheimer’s problem and not the USA’s? </b></i></p>
<p>My interest in aluminum-implicated neurological disorders caused by coal fly ash is the same throughout the world. I suspect that the aerosolized coal fly ash may be a leading cause.</p>
<p><i><b>“Worldwide, Alzheimer’s is found in at least one among 10 persons who are more than 80-year-old and one out of four persons who are above 90 years. In India, there are nearly 50 lakh [in 100,000] dementia patients of which, roughly 70 to 80 percent have Alzheimer’s. The Indian numbers are expected to double by 2030, and the costs involved are expected to increase three times.” (<a href="http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/many-unaware-of-alzheimers-disease-in-india/article5390719.ece">Source</a>)</b></i><br />
<i><b><br />
</b></i> <i><b>In India, more than 4 million people have some form of dementia. Worldwide, at least 44 million people are living with dementia, making the disease a global health crisis that must be addressed <a href="http://www.alz.org/in/dementia-alzheimers-en.asp">(Source)</a></b></i><br />

<p>As I understand it, there are UN prohibitions against using weather modification against other countries, but it is permissible within one’s own country. In reality, weather is a global phenomenon.</p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p><i>[Realistically, couldn’t weather modification be considered an act of aggression against another country—interfering with a country’s ability to raise food or experience severe floods or drought?] </i></p>
<p><i><b>In the USA, Alzheimer’s is the sixth leading cause of death! In 2015, Alzheimer’s and other dementias will cost the nation $226 BILLION. By 2050, those costs could rise as high as $1.1TRILLION. In the USA, every 67 seconds someone develops Alzheimer’s. [2] </b></i></p>
<p><i><b>I note that you state in your paper that “After the US President Barack Hussein Obama was sworn in for a second term in office on 20 January, 2014, geoengineering activities escalated sharply, becoming a near-daily occurrence in many parts of America.” </b></i></p>
<p><i><b>Could you please elaborate further on why you think that has happened? </b></i></p>
<p>That it happened, I observed firsthand, as did many people who look at the sky with concern. Why? Perhaps an unholy alliance between scientists without moral values, who are arrogant enough to think they can control nature, but who are ignorant of why they cannot, and those with vested interests, who have the same absence of moral (humanitarian) values.</p>
<p><i><b>However, in a January 2014 Press Release didn’t President Obama say, “Hundreds of countries are carrying out weather modification programs, and we’re doing it better than any of them. However, this has been secret for too long. The American People need to know about what we do to make sure our children have something to eat each and every year. It’s true we need more oversight for geoengineering projects, so I’ve signed an executive order establishing an international third party oversight group to not only investigate for abuse but also to keep the public informed about new and existing geoengineering programs.” </b></i><br />
<i><b><br />
</b></i> <i><b>And, </b></i><br />
<i><b><br />
</b></i> <i><b>“Geoengineering is necessary for our country’s agricultural industries and keeps millions of Americans employed every year. Our efforts in high altitude microwave technology at HAARP combined with the innovations in cloud seeding technology introduced by the jet fuel industry gives the American People a level of control over the elements unprecedented in the history of mankind. American Scientists are quickly approaching capabilities which will not only curb global climate change, but also to put an end to disastrous hurricanes and typhoons. For decades these programs have been kept secret out of concern for national security, but I have decided there is no need to keep this program a secret. Sensational reports that the United States will exist in a ‘bubble’ as the rest of the world heats up uncontrollably have no basis in scientific fact.” [3] </b></i></p>
<p>Geoscientists seem to have little understanding of that which is not known, especially, the multitude of diverse and complex interactions that keep nature in a state of equilibrium. More realistically than the above optimistic-nonsense, due to geoscience tinkering with nature, our planet and its life-forms will suffer severe consequences unleashed by the foolish and inhumane.</p>
<p><i><b>Here is a NOAA National Climatic Data Center map showing land and ocean temperature percentiles from January to December 2013. Personally, I wonder how factually realistic it is, especially what’s shown for the eastern Pacific Ocean, where the legend indicates a “new average.”</b></i></p>

<p><i><b>Furthermore, I’d like to point out that scientifically-speaking, what’s seen in the skies sprayed above us is referred to as “weather geoengineering” or weather modification or even atmospheric engineering, and not chemtrails, the colloquial term most readers are familiar with. However, chemtrails also are known as the Jet Fuel Cloud Seeding Program (JFCSP) working in conjunction with the classified High Altitude Auroral Research Project (HAARP) which, apparently, are being managed by the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy, and DARPA. </b></i></p>

<p>are you crazy?  coal fly ash being released from planes into the atmosphere?!?!?  That is so laughable and anyone believing or preaching such a concept has no integrity whatsoever.</p>
<p>Do you really think there are quantities of harmful chemicals or metals that can be released at 30,000 at such a concentration to effect our health?  Tell you what…..create a cube and determine the volume of air, and then determine the level of chemicals that is needed to cause a health effect.  Go to the USEPA site and get a long-term reference dose.  Now back calculate the amount of coal fly ash that would be needed to create a long-term air concentration that could be harmful to humans.</p>
<p>You see….when you apply some simple math skills you will recognize…YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT THE HECK YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT.  It is virtually impossible to release this amount of flyash into the atmosphere for two reasons:  money AND there isn’t enough fly ash to create this air concentration that would be harmful to humans.  </p>
<p>If anything, Alzheimer is more than likely related to the use of aluminum cookware and other aluminum products that come into contact with foods.  Cookware use to be made from stainless steel and these supposed Alzheimer effects were largely unnoticed.</p>
<p>These blogs like geoengineering are all pseudoscience with hardly any data that can be used to confirm their beliefs and speculative hype.  Its another “bigfoot” episode to entrance people worthless junk so they do not focus on the real issues of the world.  That would be the elite and corrupt governments that perform their daily criminal actions of fraud, theft, murder, genocide and other undescribable crimes against humanity.</p>
<p>There is nothing you can do about the “fake” theories of geoengineering hyped by wannabe scientists.  Its all lies and BS.  In the meantime, the govt and big business is digging deeper into your pockets and leaving you more desparate.  Wake up.  All these ridiculous articles are JUST A DISTRACTION.</p>
<p>The real crimes of humanity and death (since you are so worried about people) comes from our government and big government.  And its in your face 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  And you want me to be concerned about some ridiculous theory that MAYBE someone is being harmed by some unconfirmed action by unknown people???</p>
<p>Get a clue.  You aren;t that stupid are you??</p>

<p>I’ll tell you what’s distracting… a beautiful blue sky riddled with planes laying out hazy clouds day after day, followed by months of drought and forest fires. Every time there is any type of precipitation heading toward where I live, the planes arrive and the rain does not. I also know for a fact that industrial waste fluoride has been sold as a “cavity preventative” and dispersed into the nation’s drinking water. What difference does math make? The fact it’s being done and sold as “good for you” is prima facie proof that dispersing industrial waste into the population and calling it something else is a good way to get rid of it cheap. They not only don’t have to pay to get rid of toxic industrial byproducts, they can sell them instead for a huge profit! </p>
<p>Dr. Herndon’s thesis makes perfect sense, your sketchy math does not.</p>

<p>Well said. Dr Herndon’s argument is grounded in the proper application of scientific method, while the post you refer to above does not even qualify as scientism. The so-called ‘math’ was utterly irrelevant (as I strongly suspect it was meant to be; i.e., a feeble straw-man argument to distract from the real issues such as particulates concentrating in soils and water supplies and their consequent adverse biological impacts.) Further, the emotional rant was bereft of any actual data, which, again, was incredibly ironic given that poster’s own complaint that others lacked data. However, the peer-reviewed paper by Herndon was built upon a very firm foundation of said data…as soon as posters resort to such obvious (and shallow) tactics, it is definitely a sign of a non-science based agenda fuelling their rant.</p>

<p>Since we live in a corpocracy &amp; you don’t seem to think the govt would allow this; go to youtube and listen to Dr. William Hirzy, former senior vice president of the EPA Union of Scientists testifying under oath before Congress  15 years ago that “Fluoridation is a hazardous waste disposal scheme by industry. Fluorosilisic acid comes directly from the smokestack scrubbers of the phosphate  fertilizer industry [along with other toxins -mostly arsenic] . If they dump it in a lake ,river or ocean they go to jail, if they put it in a class 1 waste disposal facility it would cost millions; BUT if they sell it as a product to your municipal water department it becomes a “dental miracle” and the corporations make a profit.”<br />
   NONE of the F added to your water is a pharmaceutical drug. The FDA even states that fluoride is a drug but was never tested or approved [including those little pills the dentist gives your kids].<br />
 US govt has a long long history of covertly experimenting on it’s populace. Logic says that geoengineering is real &amp; not for your benifit. As for the money involved; it is estimated that anyone with a million dollars could fill the sky with this crap in a timely manner &amp; cause drought or flooding for their own purposes. Like Monsanto, Soros, Gates, Turner etc who have been buying up all the farm land super cheap in the mid west after years of flooding followed by years of drought.</p>

<p>Mr. dogismyth is an example of the kind of critical thinking skills we will all be relegated to once we’ve been saturated with enough aluminum.  Either Mr. dogismyth is already nearing his limit or suffers natural limitations.  Then again, he could just be a paid troll, another psychopath devoid of empathy, willing to do anything to ostensibly augment personal gain through payoff.  Either way it doesn’t matter because his message is tragically wrong as he tries to dispute scientific work performed by a qualified scientist…and fails.  Having to dispute qualified scientific studies is something T.H.E.Y. have avoided so far with payoffs and intimidation.  Dr. Herndon is obviously a brave and caring individual deserving of respect and, quite frankly, anything else we can provide that might help him further study this crime and expose it.  Godspeed, Dr.</p>

<p>1.  There is long historical precedent (ready Kirby’s article) for geoengineering, establishment white papers and patents, and frank admissions of the technology in geoengineering conferences.</p>
<p>2.  The patterns of spraying we are seeing are unlike anything ever seen before.  If not geoengineering, then what?  </p>
<p>3.  Military environmental analyst and whistleblower Kristen Meghan and others, including independent scientists, have confirmed contamination of water and soil samples at levels that can NOT be explained through natural processes.  </p>
<p>4.  Geoengineering perfectly matches the problem, reaction, solution, strategy of an engineered environmental breakdown to be used to justify world government.</p>
<p>5.  Money in not an issue when TPTB control the printing presses, have a “black budget”, foundations with insider information on the markets, and TRILLIONS are officially “missing” from US government coffers. </p>
<p>6.  Coal ash is merely suggested as a “filler” material because it has a similar or nearly identical chemical profile to soil and water contaminants found in heavily sprayed areas.  If you don’t know how and why fluoride, another industrial waste very expensive to legally dispose, was put into drinking water, then please check out the incredibly well researched book The Fluoride Deception by Christopher Bryson.</p>
<p>7.  Geoengineering, even as a small scale series of ongoing military “tests”, is a crime against humanity.  Don’t think that those concerned about geoengineering are too “distracted” to be aware of other elite crimes against humanity – the opposite is true as it’s easier to become more galvanized witnessing chemtrails day after day and it also has been an effective way to wake more people up!</p>

<p>The radiation in Europe is from Chernobyl (1986). Some particles stay in the environment for one hundred years, other particles one thousand years. I looked at this Alzheimer’s map recently. Some European countries have low, others high rate of Alzheimer’s, so that is not connected to the Chernobyl radioactive fallout over Europe and Scandinavia. Nutrition-wise Alzheimer’s is connected to sugar. I looked at Sweden and Finland, they consume a lot of dairy sugar and have high rates of the disease. US has a high consumption of wheat (complex carbs break down to sugar) and high rate of Alzheimer’s. Costa Rica has a high consumption of table sugar and high rate of Alzh. I have read aluminum is also related to the disease and to many other health problems, and while higher rates of Alzh. are surely partly caused by the use of aluminum cooking pots, I totally believe aluminum in the air we breathe also contribute to the disese. Re temps, during the past 10 years the global temp went up by 0.08 degree F. I would not call it a global w-a-r-m-i-n-g. During the same time temp in the US went down by 0.69 degrees F, which I wonder if it is b/c of the spraying/chemtrails? According to some physicists we are now in a global cooling phase. Re the question what is going on globally, I recently stumbled upon an article on google called “The History of the House of Rothschild”, by A. Hitchcock, which explains global political and financial events related to this family, and in extension to health and global population size, which was surprising.</p>

<p>I live in Santa Fe, New Mexico and the skies, if left alone for a day, are a deep dark blue. It is possible to view mountain ranges 100 miles away. On a “spray day” the first passes are easy to view and oftentimes the operators are adjusting the flow which are very obvious starts and stops until an even layer is achieved. I have very powerful binoculars, Spion 140×70, and this allows me to see these jets and their dispersion maneuvers close up. Most of the spray jets are orange in color, probably 75%. The rest of them are silver and have had the underneath wings and fuselage painted out in black. These might be ex-military with numbers blocked out. Under each wing is one singular jet engine and NOTHING is emitting from the engines. No “ice particles” in the exhaust as complying statist believers will define these clouds blotting out the sky. The engines are burning totally clear. The spray is coming out in two streams off the tips of the back wings. I say to the believers, “go outside and look up” but this would hurt their neck, I guess. I am a truther, I never believe what I am told. Believers believe and that’s that. I have a friend named Bernard, who is actually named after Bernard Vonnegut, brother to writer Kurt Vonnegut, who was essentially the godfather of chemtrails. Kurt used to write about his brother “playing God” with the clouds and weather. Read “Chemtrails Exposed” by Peter A. Kirby where he devotes several pages to Vonnegut and the original experiments conducted in New Mexico in the 1950’s. I have mentioned the chemtrails to my friend Bernard and he pats me on the head and chants “ice crystals, my dear” and quickly changes the subject.</p>

<p>Yes – denser atmosphere breaks meteors higher, reduces chance of a citysmasher. We can raise sections of the atmosphere electromagnetically; combine that with increased density and tricks like energy conductivity – good passive defense plus enables particle-beam active defense IF atmosphere is filled with the right crud to make the beam work. Now, there are lots of other reasons to spray crud, weather control among them, but I do think energetic-atmosphere weapons and the hope of surviving a bad impact probably also factor into the decisionmaking around these things. Sorry to be so slow responding! Never remember to check this thing.</p>

<p>UH, the author and those who have commented below have NOT done due diligence and checked out the source of the quote attributed to Pres. Obama.  It is a HOAX article, published in a page akin to “The Onion.”  He never said that, nor anything like it.<br />
Yet everyone, including the writer, sucked it up and believed because you want so much to be validated.  Here’s some math I’ll let you research yourself so you know I’m not making things up:<br />
How much weight is an airplane able to carry?<br />
How long is the flight path of a plane going horizon to horizon?<br />
How heavy is coal fly ash?<br />
How much coal ash per mile would be spread?<br />
How big is a particle of coal ash?<br />
How long would it take for something that size to fall to a level that it is able to be breathed/ingested?<br />
How much of each element within the coal fly ash?<br />
What is a toxic level of each element?</p>
<p>I’m sure that like “dogismyth,” I will be called a troll and blasted for applying some real science, math and research, but hey, I’m not the person who fell for a hoax article, which makes me a bit smarter than the rest of you.  Deal with it.  And if any of you do decide to research just a bit, please also look up “confirmation bias.”  You all have it.</p>

<p><i>Rationing and policy didn’t give us the healthcare we have today, it will not provide us proper healthcare tomorrow.  </i></p>
<p>Tony Cartalucci, <i>Contributor</i><br />
<a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2012/04/how-to-end-healthcare-debate-forever.html"><b>Activist Post</b></a></p>
<p>In the modern political arena, we are provided a  myriad of false choices, while our supposedly  elected representatives skillfully and purposefully obfuscate and  maneuver around real, permanent solutions. This is because the vast  majority of the power and influence today’s ruling elite enjoy across  the Western world is derived precisely because of perpetual, seemingly  unsolvable problems. In many cases, these “problems” are manufactured by  the very people proposing solution. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/?p=16710">fraudulent “War on Terror</a>”  is one such manufactured problem, perpetually both fueled and fought by  the monied elite to keep their rackets, and the power, wealth, and  influence derived from them continuing perpetually. The healthcare debate is  another problem capable of being permanently solved, but is allowed to  purposefully drag on to maintain an entire industry built upon  exploiting the desperation of the sick and injured.</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both;text-align: center">                         </div>
</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both;text-align: left">An otherwise unsavory politician, US Representative Mike Rogers of  Michigan, who has introduced the Hitlerian CISPA bill and himself  entirely disingenuous about solving the healthcare problem, did manage  to accurately diagnose both the problem and the real solution facing  America and how it treats its sick and injured. Rogers correctly states  that the solution is innovation, private enterprise, and individuals.  However, when Rogers says this, he means the very multinationals that  drafted “Obamacare” in the first place and is simply peppering the false  left-right paradigm to make it more palatable for an increasingly  astute public.</div>
<p>
<a name="more"></a><b>Innovation to Increase Supply Beyond Demand</b></p>
<p>The basic principle behind supply and demand is that the more readily  available any given good or service is, the lower the price to purchase  it. There are different strategies that can be used to lower the price,  but essentially it requires making a good or service cheaper to produce  or perform and increasing its supply verses a particular level of  demand.</p>
<div align="center">
</div>
<p>
In the case of meat, early human beings were subject to the natural  populations of game animals. Like many other species, establishing and  defending territory to hunt and gather in was a matter of life and  death. Should a local human population’s demand increase beyond the  natural population of game animals, people would either starve or be  forced to expand their territory, risking conflict with neighboring  tribes or large predators. The game changer was technology, and in this  particular case, agriculture. Now more food could be produced in the  same amount of territory, so much so that many members of the tribe  could occupy themselves with activities other than hunting and gathering  – there was a surplus.</p>
<p>Agriculture, however, is dependent on weather and climate; and in  response to these variables, additional methods and technologies have  been devised, including irrigation and greenhouses. Today, under normal  circumstances, human beings fighting over food is unheard of – our  mastery of agriculture has produced vast surpluses. People starve today  because of greed, conflict, financial manipulation, and archaic  distribution models – not an inability to produce enough food.</p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>
<script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
<ins class="adsbygoogle"
     style="display:block; text-align:center;"
     data-ad-layout="in-article"
     data-ad-format="fluid"

<p>Access to information has perhaps exceeded even our ancient mastery of  agriculture, and approaches what is known as “post-scarcity;” or, in other  words, it has become so abundant and easily accessible that it not only  costs nothing to obtain, but the more in-demand it is, the easier it is  to come by. It is predicted that computer-controlled manufacturing  methods and sub-atomic material science will eventually translate this  “information post-scarcity” to the physical world where digital bits are  replaced by atoms.</p>
<p>So how then does this apply to healthcare and how exactly does it end the healthcare debate “forever?”</p>
<p><b>Education</b> </p>
<p>The solution, in the context of supply and demand, is very simple.  Increase the number of people involved in both providing healthcare  services, as well as designing, developing, and manufacturing biomedical  technology. America’s sabotaged education system would be the first  place to start. Healthcare is currently expensive because of a limited  number of qualified students that can study medicine, fewer who can  afford to study it, and similar exclusivity in regards to enterprises  developing modern medical technology. </p>
<p>Raising the overall competence of students increases the number of  potential eligible medical students. This demand forces medical schools  to expand their capacity and perhaps even developing new curriculum to  allow such expansion to move vertically as well as horizontally. Smaller  medical colleges and schools could be set up beyond main campuses, and  as the pool of qualified medical practitioners and instructors  increases, the price required for their services would drop – along with  tuition.</p>

<p><i><b>Video</b>: Dr. Jack Choi’s virtual dissection table is just one  example of how technology makes it possible to teach the demanding study  of medicine to a larger number of students when previous restrictions  on resources would have made it impossible. </i></p>
<p>Additionally the curriculum itself must be continuously updated,  covering not only the latest developments in medical research, but  leveraging the latest developments in technology to effectively teach  more students, faster and more efficiently. One example of this comes to  us from a recent TED Talk featuring Dr. Jack Choi of <a href="http://www.anatomage.com/company.html">Anatomage</a> and his <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxMGItCnINE">virtual dissection table</a>  – giving medical students without access to actual human bodies the  chance to simulate real autopsies. Before the advent of such technology,  medical students would either do without this valuable learning  experience, thus restricting their education and preparedness when  entering a practice. </p>
<p>Leveraging the ever-expanding library of university-level lectures  available through “Open Course Ware” could be another way to disseminate  the knowledge of the world’s best instructors to a greater number of  willing students – even if only as a supplement to their regular  studies. Already universities like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/mit?ob=4">MIT</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/UCBerkeley?ob=0">Berkley</a> provide an immense amount of lectures for free on both their own websites and on YouTube for anyone in the world to use. </p>
<div style="float: right;margin-left: 1em;margin-bottom: 0em"><a href="http://activistpost.net/emergencyherbs.html"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/_qLAIskTQXUc/TZPBZ7ENF_I/AAAAAAAAH7U/OOzRqVIgung/emergencyherbs2.jpg" alt=""></a></div>
<p><b>Technology</b></p>
<p>When one walks into a modern intensive care unit, they will most likely  notice a variety of advanced biomedical technology monitoring vital  signs, administering medication, and assisting doctors and nurses in a  large variety of tasks. This equipment is incredibly expensive, and is  so precisely because only a handful of companies have a competent  research and development team to develop this equipment and a qualified  workforce to manufacture it.</p>
<p>Again, increasing the number of people qualified in the fields of  design, development, and manufacturing, in any capacity will inevitably  expand the number of entrepreneurs involved in biomedical technology,  expanding supply and reducing costs. Again this leads us back to  improving education to produce the human resources needed.</p>
<p>However, there is another factor that is incredibly important – and that  is raising public awareness to just how far we’ve come and what the  possibilities are that await us in the near future. Every great  scientist, engineer, explorer, or doctor can cite who or what inspired  them to take up their chosen trade. Inspiring people to become  researchers, designers, doctors, and scientists is just as important as  being able to train them to reach their full potential. </p>
<p>Additionally, being fully informed as to what the current state of  medical research is, allows us to make more informed decisions regarding  public funding and policy. Raising awareness for cutting edge research  also builds enthusiasm throughout both the pubic, their representatives  in government, and across industry, making available more support and  funds for areas of interest we can all agree upon as being beneficial  for society.</p>
<p><b>Bio-printing at Wake Forest </b></p>
<p>Imagine instead of spending the rest of your life on medication to  correct imbalances caused by faulty, failing, or injured organs and  instead having a replacement grown, even “printed” for you in the matter  of weeks? Applied “regenerative medicine” was once solely in the realm  of science fiction, but is now science reality, thanks to researchers at  <a href="http://www.wakehealth.edu/WFIRM/">Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine</a> (WFIRM). </p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both;text-align: center">                  </div>
<p>
Clinical trials have already been performed where tissue samples have  been taken from patients, replacement tissue and organs cultivated in  WFIRM’s laboratory, and then implanted back into the patient.  Revolutionary research and development like this could be multiplied  exponentially with a properly informed population, properly educated  youth, and a larger pool of both medical practitioners and biomedical  technology developers. </p>
<p><b>Gene-Therapy at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital</b></p>
<p>Imagine going to the doctor with a condition, and instead of leaving  with a prescription medication to take (and pay for) for the rest of  your life, you walked out with a permanent treatment derived from simply  correcting your problem on a genetic level. For patients suffering from  hemophilia B, a disorder where blood does not properly clot during  bleeding, this is now becoming a reality.</p>
<p>At St. Jude’s Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis Tennessee a  treatment involving the modification of a patient’s DNA through gene  therapy has yielded unexpectedly positive results, opening the door not  only for the permanent treatment for hemophilia B, but hemophilia A – a  more common variant – as well as other more complex conditions in the  future.</p>
<p>Combined with bio-printing, gene therapy stands to turn the concept of  medical treatment on its head, excising from the pharmaceutical giants a  massive proportion of their profits and subsequently their grip on  government through their immense lobbying efforts. Such lobbying  efforts, however might explain why more people are aware of, and even on  the toxic cocktails they produce, and clueless about the revolutionary  work taking place at St. Jude’s Children’s Research Hospital.   </p>

<p>What if you could have your DNA sequenced in the morning, repaired and  reintroduced into your body by evening? The steps necessary for such a  future are being taken first at the J. Craig Venter Institute. Dr. Craig  Venter pioneered methods of sequencing DNA and was first to map the  human genome. Since then, his institute has created the first “synthetic  lifeform,” engineered on the genetic level and “printed” with a machine  that combines the basic chemicals found in DNA, then swapping out the  genes of an existing species of bacteria with Venter’s own creation.</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both;text-align: center">            </div>
<p>
Eventually it may be possible to combine the work of Venter with that of  both St. Jude’s and Wake Forest to treat nearly every conceivable  condition, from injuries and failing organs, to genetic conditions like  hemophilia, and even aging. Yet the work of scientists like Venter  suffers from underfunding and under exposure, narrowing the choices they  have of who to turn to for funding and being faced with the prospect of  either ending their research or compromising their goals and ethics for  the sake of a profiteering corporation. This is why it is essential to  raise awareness of this revolutionary work so that it ends up cultivated  by those who seek to serve humanity rather than exploited by those who  seek to dominate it. (An additional note of caution about Craig Venter can be found <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2010/12/white-house-gives-go-ahead-for-elitists.html">HERE</a> – Ed.)</p>
<p><b>Innovation</b></p>
<p>Already around the world people old and young alike come together to  share a passion for designing, tinkering, building, and modifying.  Similar to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5n-APFrlXDs">MIT professor Neil Gershenfeld’s “Fabrication Laboratories</a>”  (Fab Labs), these groups not only serve as a community resource for  solving problems on a local level, but have served as the launching pad  for aspiring entrepreneurs. <a href="http://www.nycresistor.com/">New York City’s “Resistor</a>” collective has produced not only a company that makes and sells 3D printers called “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fScRYhq-5M0">MakerBots</a>,” but many of its members are involved in the “<a href="http://makezine.com/">Make Magazine</a>” publication <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/makemagazine">and videos</a>. </p>
<p>These groups as well as individuals constitute an expanding “maker  culture” and are tackling problems with innovation and ingenuity across  the spectrum from the mundane and comical, to the incredibly practical  and even revolutionary. Medical technology, especially in non-critical  areas, has also benefited from this Do-It-Yourself culture.</p>

<p>Renowned in maker circles is “<a href="http://hackaday.com/">Hack-a-Day</a>,” featuring projects from around the world, including an entire category titled, “Medical Hacks.” One project titled, “<a href="http://hackaday.com/2011/09/14/cheapstat-an-open-source-potentiostat/">CheapStat: An Open-Source Potentiostat,</a>”  features an open-source version of a device used to analyze the  chemical composition of substances at a fraction of the cost of a  commercial unit. Other devices measuring pulse, or automating medication  dispensers also demonstrate the possibilities of a bottom-up model of  research and development of medical technology that will overall reduce  its cost while increasing accessibility for more people.</p>
<p>As manufacturing technology becomes smaller, cheaper, and easier to use,  hobbyists and professionals alike will be able to implement their ideas  quicker and more efficiently, and through the use of information  technology, collaborate and disseminate their work at a greater pace.  </p>
<p><b>Conclusion </b></p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/teslasecret/" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" class="noshadow" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/_qLAIskTQXUc/TaqAcrCPlhI/AAAAAAAAISQ/5uq527jnmDM/book-shape.jpg" style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% transparent"></a>This “do-it-yourself” mentality used to be a hallmark of American  society, and coincidentally produced a culture with a “can-do” attitude.  It is not only possible for America to solve its problems today with  such a mentality, but an absolute necessity. The nanny-state run by  faux-governance controlled by corporate-financiers demonstratively  doesn’t work.   </p>
<p>When we understand the true problem facing us in terms of providing  quality, affordable healthcare to an entire population, that it  ultimately hinges on supply and demand, and that education, technology,  and innovation are the only ways to truly resolve this problem, the  debate over healthcare ends. By no means should any nation simply pull  the plug on benefit plans people depend on no matter how ill-conceived  they are, or how inadequate the care they provide may be. However, we  must look at subsidized programs as a temporary stop-gap while we pursue  permanent, pragmatic solutions seeking to solve permanently problems  the government and the corporations that they truly represent seek to  perpetuate indefinitely. </p>
<p>Instead of figuring out the best way to  funnel public funds into the pockets of Bayer, Gilead, Pfzier, Roche,  and GlaxoSmithKline to treat the symptoms of diseases <i>ad infinitum</i>,  bankrupting ourselves and our nation while these gargantuan  multinationals get larger yet, we should be investing in education,  research and development, and dedicating our time to studying design,  innovation, and technology to prevent diseases where possible and cure  diseases permanently when prevention isn’t enough.</p>
<p>A single individual’s contributions to either tackling these problems  head-on, or simply raising awareness of these issues and ideas to  generate the support innovators and pioneers need to continue doing  their work honestly, openly, and for the benefit of mankind may seem  negligible, but our collective efforts can eclipse even that of the  largest multinationals by many factors.</p>
<p>The state of the society we live in, including the quality and future of  our healthcare, is determined daily by how we collectively choose to  spend our time, money, attention, and energy. Spend it wisely and we  will achieve true progress. Spend it poorly and we will continue to be  mired in this circular futile healthcare debate, where we are promised  the sky, receive nothing, all while large pharmaceutical and insurance  companies prosper.  </p>
<p>Demand from your elected representatives that for every nanny-state  solution they propose, they develop two more to improve education,  research and development to produce permanent, pragmatic solutions.  Ensure that they include benchmarks for achieving these goals and  language in each panned entitlement program that clearly states such  socialist policies are meant only to ensure people do not go without  proper care until innovation, ingenuity, and invention provide care they  can afford without subsidies.</p>
<p>If elected representatives insist on serving corporate-financier  interests instead of the best interests of the people; if they insist,  as Representative Mike Rogers of Michigan does, on dangling accurate  depictions of our current problems before us, but then disingenuously  continuing to compound them, we must begin organizing, collaborating,  and solving these problems on our own, at a local level, and ensuring  that our resources go to those truly seeking to solve these problems  with innovation and ingenuity instead of to exploiters, lobbyists, and  shareholders and their proxies in government. </p>
<p>Since the dawn of man we have ensured our survival, prosperity, and  progress by building better spears, devising new technologies, and  climbing over the next horizon. The day we stop doing this, is the day  we stop moving forward. Politicians who would have us ration our  resources and relinquish our health to policies and rationing regimes  conjured up by bureaucrats would have ensured our extinction ages ago if  braver visionaries didn’t prevail. Today, braver visionaries must  prevail. End the healthcare debate today, and begin tomorrow with a new  dialogue on how to use improved education, innovation, and development  to expand the supply of competent medical practitioners and the  technology they need to provide the best healthcare possible to all.</p>

<p>Brandon Smith, <i>Contributor</i><br />
<a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2013/02/the-us-economy-is-now-dangerously.html"><b>Activist Post</b></a></p>
<p>Recently I was asked to give a presentation on the current state of  the global economy to a local group of concerned citizens here in  Northwest Montana.  I was happy to oblige but when composing my bullet  points I realized that, in truth, there were no legitimate economic  numbers to examine anymore.  You see, financial analysts have  traditionally used multiple indicators of employment, profit, savings,  credit, supply, and demand in their efforts to divine the often obscured  facts of our financial system.  The problem is, nearly every index we  used in the past, every measure of capital flow and industry, is  absolutely useless today.  </p>
<p>We now live in an entirely fabricated  fiscal environment.  Every aspect of it is filtered, muddled, molded,  and manipulated before our eyes ever get to study the stats.  The  metaphor may be overused, but our economic system has become an absolute  “matrix”.  All that we see and hear has been homogenized and all truth  has been sterilized away.  There is nothing to investigate anymore.  It  is like awaking in the middle of a vast and hallucinatory live action  theater production, complete with performers, props, and sound effects,  all designed to confuse us and do us harm.  In the end, trying to make  sense of the illusion is a waste of time.  All we can do is look for the  exits…</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>There is some tangible reality out there, but it is  difficult to find, and there are few if any mainstream numbers to  verify.  One has to remember always that the fundamental world of money  and trade revolves around real people and real circumstances.  No matter  how corrupt our economic system is, as long as there are human beings,  there will always be supply and demand that cannot be hidden.  We have  to look past the “official numbers” and look at the roots of trade.   Where has demand fallen?  Where has supply diminished?  Where are the  tangible goods and needs and how have they changed?</p>
<p>Let’s first  start with the mainstream version of our system, looking at each aspect  of the economy that no longer represents the truth of our situation… </p>

<b>Employment, Savings, And Debt </b> </p>
<p>Much  of this information is old news to those of us in the Liberty Movement,  who tracked the progress of the global collapse long before the general  public even knew of its existence.  However, it is useful to take a  step back and look at the basic picture every once in a while.  </p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>According  to numbers issued by the Department of Labor, weekly unemployment  reports have dropped to a five year low, and the overall employment rate  is holding at 7.9%.  This would seem to be a vast improvement over the  dreadful bloodletting in the system only a few years ago.  Has the  private Federal Reserve and the Obama Administration really done it?   Have they turned back the tide on the greatest fiscal crisis the U.S.  has seen since the Depression?</p>
<p>No.  They haven’t.  </p>
<p>They  have only changed how the data is disseminated to the public. In order  to understand how the employment statistics con is being engineered, it  is important to understand the difference between “Adjusted” and  “Unadjusted” numbers.</p>
<p>Labor Department data is “seasonally  adjusted”, using a series of statistical assumptions including something  called “Trend Cycle Analysis”.  Trend Cycle Analysis is, basically, a  sham, but a sham put together in a very complex and confusing manner.   If you ask a mainstream economist what it is, you’ll likely get a three  hour long dissertation filled with financial babble and very little  concrete explanation.  So let me break it down as simply as I can…</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/familysurvival.html" style="float: right;margin-left: 1em;margin-bottom: 0em"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ASIFGy_z7zU/UCFiDQK8GBI/AAAAAAAAROU/7AHejVY_hUE/s202/3.gif"></a>Imagine  that you are going to estimate how much profit you plan to make in a  particular month, but you don’t just consider your current pay rate and  pop it into a calculator; you also throw in the possibility of a few pay  raises, an inheritance from a grandma who might kick the bucket, and,  your exaggerated expectations of the entire year’s profit on top of  that.  You may also take into account future bad weather, a mugging, a  nuclear war….whatever.  All hypothetical situations not based in  reality.  Basically, you decide that a particular trend in your income  is inevitable, then, mold your statistical analysis around that  assumption.       </p>
<p>When your real profit numbers come in (the  unadjusted numbers) and they do not meet your expectations, you simply  change them according to what you believe SHOULD have happened.  If you  insist that your profits are going to go up for the year, and they go  down for a couple months instead, you change the variables you use to  calculate the statistical average so that the results match your  expectations, assuming that it will all balance out in the end.</p>
<p>Now,  this sounds utterly insane for the common person out there trying to  make a living.  If you ran your household this way, without accepting  the cold hard unadjusted numbers in front of you, you’d find yourself  broke and on the street in no time.  Unfortunately this is EXACTLY how  our government handles most financial data; by coming to a final  conclusion before hand, and then forcing the numbers to fit that  conclusion.</p>
<p>This is why in February of 2013, “adjusted” first  week unemployment rate was reported at 366,000 – a 5000 person drop from  the week before.  A seeming improvement in the trend.  But, unadjusted  numbers came in at 386,176 – a 16,000 person spike from the week  before.  When one examines real unemployment numbers, he finds that the  divergence between the adjusted and unadjusted statistics is growing  larger with each passing quarter.  That is to say, the contradiction is  becoming so blatant between the hard numbers and the Labor Department’s  fantasy numbers that one must question whether or not the government is  lying to us outright about the state of the economy (hint – they are  lying).  </p>
<p>These same methods are used by the government to calculate progress in the housing market, disposable income, etc.  </p>
<p>The  claim of “recovery” in the jobs market simply doesn’t jive with other  indicators, like 2012 Christmas retail, which had the worst showing  since the crash in 2008 (and these are still mainstream numbers!):<br />
<a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/12/26/us-holiday-retail-sales-growth-weakest-since-2008/"><br />
http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/12/26/us-holiday-retail-sales-growth-weakest-since-2008/ </a></p>
<p>Average  household savings continue to scrape the bottom of the barrel,  indicating that the public is not spending or withholding cash.  They  are simply broke:</p>

And  the overall GDP of the U.S. contracted in the fourth quarter of 2012  for the first time in three years (again, according to official numbers,  meaning the reality is much worse):<br />

<p>The  downturn in consumption and industry also seems to be supported by the  Baltic Dry Index, a measure of global shipping and rates.  The BDI has  fallen to near historic lows THREE TIMES in the past year, which to my  knowledge, has never happened before.  In the past, the BDI has been a  strong prophetic indicator of future market volatility.  Usually, around  a year after a severe decline in the index, a dangerous economic event  takes place.  The BDI made its first sharp drop to all time lows at the  end of January 2012, exactly a year ago.  </p>
<p>U.S. household debt  was recently reported to have fallen to a 29-year low, but the ratio  used by the Federal Reserve applies a statistic for disposable income  that is derived from the Trend Cycle boondoggle method.  While markets  cheer, the truth is, the only reason household debt obligations have  fallen at all is because bank lending and credit issuance remains  frozen.  Consumer debt falls when there is no money to borrow.  In fact,  the Federal Reserve actually pays large banks NOT to lend to the  public; an activity which was exposed by Dennis Kucinich in 2009 on the  House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.  An activity that  continued through 2012:<br />

<p>Meanwhile, the  supposed job recovery has produced an astonishing increase in welfare  recipients in the U.S., including a record 46 million Americans on  foodstamps (approximately 15% of our population):<br />

<p>If  we are to apply any “trend” to our calculations on overall economic  health, then we should include the extreme level of government handouts,  and poverty levels which are now at all time highs.  The facts are  undeniable; the number of people who have much less than they did in  2008 has grown.  How then could the U.S. be considered “in recovery”?</p>
<p><b>National Debt And The Fiat Lie</b></p>
<p>With  the Dow Index hovering near highs of 14,000 our system truly looks to  be on a rocket ship to pre-2008 money market bliss.  In a mere five  years we have returned to equity spikes that stagger the mind and the  wallet.  At least, that’s how it all appears…</p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>What needs to be  taken into account, though, is the amount of fiat money being created by  the Federal Reserve, and how much of that printed pixie dust currency  is fueling our magical flight to Neverland.  Since 2008, our official  national debt has increased from $10 trillion to $16.4 trillion, and  some estimate $17 trillion to $18 trillion by the end of 2013 (unless,  of course, a collapse occurs).  Which means our national debt, which  took decades to reach the $10 trillion mark, will have nearly doubled in  only six years!  </p>
<p>So, what has a doubling of our national debt  in such a short span of time bought us?  Well, credit markets remain  frozen, property markets remain stagnant, poverty is at historic levels,  welfare recipients are at epic highs, and consumer activity and GDP is  back at 2008 lows.  Where did all that printed money go?  Where was it  spent?  To answer that question, we only need to find what area of the  economy has seen the most positive (or fantastical) activity.  What  sector is seeing a massive boost while the rest tumbles?</p>
<p>I  suggest that a large portion of QE1 through QE3 has gone to prop up the  stock market, and nothing else.  I suggest that American taxpayers are  fronting the bill for the equities bonanza we see today.  I suggest that  the Dow is being used as a Red Herring to distract the populous for as  long as possible while real assets are being snapped up and hoarded by  international banks and foreign entities.  I suggest that we are being  leached dry and that the parasites are almost ready to move on…</p>

<p>When this collapse is initiated, it would certainly  behoove all parties involved, including central banks, international  banks, and criminal politicians, to have a scapegoat handy for the  citizenry to direct their rage at.</p>

<p>An  “Event Horizon” in physics is a moment or singularity in spacetime at  which a gravitational pull becomes so great that there is no way to  escape it.  It is a point of no return.  I believe America’s economy has  reached its own Event Horizon.  Our system is now entirely fiat driven,  with very little or no true economy left.  Without constant injections  from the Fed, and perpetually low interest rates, the country would  implode tomorrow.  This is not recovery.  Actually, I’m not sure what to  call it.  </p>
<p>Today, independent economic analysts cannot look to  the numbers to determine future trends.  Most are fake, and the rest are  ugly, and I’m not sure much else can be said in their regard.  Instead,  we must now look to events, rather than statistics, because our country  has been maneuvered into a position of utmost frailty.  Like an  avalanche shelf waiting for that perfectly timed disturbance to trigger  its roaring collapse.  All that is needed is a macro-crisis, and it is  no great feat for such a thing to be created in our tension filled  global environment.</p>
<p>War in Syria and Iran leading to a tripling  of energy prices.  Sanctions and strife with North Korea leading to  Chinese economic retribution.  Conflict between China and Japan, again  leading to Chinese economic warfare and perhaps real warfare.  An  opportune “cyber attack” which could be used as an excuse for a market  crash and even an internet shutdown.  A “political impasse” between Reps  and Dems which leads to a default of U.S. credit.  Any one of these  catastrophes could easily occur (with a little nudge from some well  placed people) and feed a wider global tragedy.  The important thing to  remember is that while this event will be blamed for the breakdown, it  was international banks, the Federal Reserve, and elements of our own  government that made the domino effect possible.  They put the pieces in  place.  The act that knocks them over is secondary.</p>

I have spent  the past seven years writing about “potential” threats to our overall  system, but these dangers were always just beyond our sight.  Just  around the corner.  Today, it is as if the journey is over, and all  those threats have materialized right before my eyes as real, and  imminent.  I am watching that which I warned of come to fruition, and  this is certainly not a pleasant thing.  What is valuable, though, is  what we have all done in the Liberty Movement with the time that we  had.  From when I began writing for the movement until now, I have seen  an overwhelming increase in public awareness.  It may not be obvious to  newer activists, but it is there all the same.  While we still face  disparaging odds, and millions upon millions of oblivious bystanders,  there is, amidst these darker moments, a steadfast community of free men  and women forming.  I have full faith in the future.  Much more so than  I ever did before.  Our economy may be detached from reality, but our  endeavors as individuals will not be.  Our resolve will be the great  game changer.  Not fiscal calamity.</p>

<p><em>In November 2016, Consortiumnews.com was listed with about 200 other websites at the shadowy “PropOrNot” website, which was claiming to serve as a watchdog against undue “Russian influence” in the United States. The PropOrNot blacklist was elevated by the Washington Post as a credible source, despite the fact that the neo-McCarthyites who compiled the list hid behind a cloak of anonymity. As an article at Consortiumnews <a href="https://consortiumnews.com/2016/11/27/washington-posts-fake-news-guilt/">explained</a> at the time, the Post granted PropOrNot anonymity “to smear journalists who don’t march in lockstep with official pronouncements from the State Department or some other impeccable fount of never-to-be-questioned truth.”</em></p>
<p><em>Now, George Eliason, an American journalist living in Ukraine, has published an article at Washington’s Blog – one of the other 200 blacklisted websites – examining the cast of characters who may be behind the PropOrNot endeavor. As explained in a disclaimer at <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2018/01/untying-propornot-look-2017s-biggest-fake-news-story.html">the original article</a> at Washington’s Blog: “A leading cybersecurity expert has publicly said that Mr. Eliason’s research as presented in this article does not violate the law. Washington’s Blog does not express an opinion about whether or not the claims set forth in this article are accurate or not. Make up your own mind.”</em></p>
<p><strong>(<a href="https://consortiumnews.com/2018/01/28/unpacking-the-shadowy-outfit-behind-2017s-biggest-fake-news-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CN</a>) <span style="font-weight: 400">— </span></strong>A little over a year ago, the deep state graced the world with <a title="Propornot" href="http://www.propornot.com/p/the-yyycampaignyyy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PropOrNot</a>. Thanks to them, 2017 became the year of fake news. Every news website and opinion column now had the potential to be linked to the Steele dossier and Trump collusion with Russia. Every journalist was either “with us or against us.” Anyone who challenged the Russiagate narrative became Russia’s trolls.</p>
<p>Fortunately for the free world, the anonymous group known as PropOrNot that tried to “out” every website as a potential Russian colluder, in the end only implicated themselves. Turnabout is fair play and that’s always the fun part, isn’t it? With that in mind, I know the dogs are going to howl this evening over this one.</p>
<p>The damage PropOrNot did to scores of news and opinions websites in late 2016-2017 provides the basis of a massive civil suit. I mean huge, as in the potential is there for a tobacco company-sized class-action sized lawsuit. I can say that because I know a lot about a number of entities that are involved and the enormous amount of money behind them.</p>
<p>How serious is this? <a title="In 2016, a $10,000 reward was put out for the identities of Propornot " href="https://www.naturalnews.com/056198_PropOrNot_reward_fake_news.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In 2016, a $10,000 reward was put out for the identities of PropOrNot</a> players. No one has claimed it yet, and now, I guess no one will. There are times in your life that taking a stand has a cost. To make sure the story gets out and is taken seriously, this is one of those times.</p>
<p>In this article, you’ll meet some of the people staffing PropOrNot. You’ll meet the people and publications that provide their expenses and cover the logistics. You’ll meet a few of the deep state players. We’ll deal with them very soon. They need to see this as the warning shot over the bow and start playing nice with regular people. After that, you’ll meet the NGOs that are funding and orchestrating all of it. How am I doing so far?</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-115211" src="http://theantimedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/image-1-1.jpg" alt="" width="1354" height="528"></p>
<p>The image above is the clincher or game winner that supplies the necessary proof up front and the direct path to PropOrNot. This was a passive scan of Propornot.com showing the administrative dashboard belongs to the InterpreterMag.com as shown on the left of the image. On the right, it shows that uploads to Propornot.com come from InterpreterMag.com and is a product of that publication.</p>
<p>Now we have the first layer of PropOrNot and our first four contestants. We have a slew of new media organizations that are influenced by, or feeding PropOrNot. Remember, fake news got off the ground and got its wings because of the attention this website received from the Washington Post in Dec. 2016.</p>

<p>The strand that ties this crew together is they all work for Ukrainian Intelligence. If you hit the links, the ties are documented very clearly. We’ll get to that point again shortly, but let’s go further:</p>
<p>PropOrNot -&gt; Atlantic Council -&gt; Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG)</p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>Who are the BBG? The Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) is an independent agency of the United States government. According to its website, its mission is to “inform, engage, and connect people around the world in support of freedom and democracy.” Its projects include Voice of America (VOA), Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio y Television Marti, Radio Free Asia, and the Middle East Broadcast Networks.</p>
<p>The BBG’s bipartisan board was <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/donald-trump-voice-of-america-232442">eliminated and replaced</a> with a single appointed chief executive officer as part of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017, which was passed in December 2016.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-115213" src="http://theantimedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/image-3.png" alt="" width="825" height="411"></p>
<p>On January 1, 2016, the Interpreter became a special project of RFE/RL and under the oversight of the BBG. The Secretary of State had a seat on the board of the BBG until December 2016. Why the change?</p>
<p>During the 2016 election, the BBG developed a major conflict of interest. At least two BBG board members worked actively for the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign. These government officials were working against the president-elect after the election. It looks like it didn’t go unnoticed. In the following linked article, it shows that they should be investigated for their part in an attempted coup.</p>
<p><a title="From a Nov 7, 2016, article" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2016/11/almost-legal-coup-hillary-clinton-iio-operations-election-2016.html">From a Nov 7, 2016, article</a>– “<a title="Karen Kornbluh" href="http://www.politico.com/tipsheets/morning-tech/2016/05/inside-hillary-clintons-tech-policy-orbit-cornyn-predicts-ecpa-compromise-privacy-hawks-see-little-room-for-it-214532" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karen Kornbluh</a> is helping refine and to get Hillary Clinton’s message out.” All of them are names to watch if Clinton wins — and key jobs at the FCC and other federal agencies are up for grabs.”</p>
<p><a title="According to her bio" href="http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/about-us/leadership/karen-kornbluh.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to her bio</a>: Karen founded the New America Foundation’s Work and Family Program and is a senior fellow for Digital Policy at the Council on Foreign Relations. Karen has written extensively about technology policy, women, and family policy for The Atlantic, The New York Times and The Washington Post. New York Times columnist David Brooks cited her Democracy article “Families Valued,” focused on “juggler families” as one of the best magazine articles of 2006.</p>
<p><a title="Michael Kempner" href="http://www.odwyerpr.com/story/public/6630/2016-04-01/mwws-kempner-is-staunch-clinton-supporter.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michael Kempner</a> is the founder, President and Chief Executive Officer of MWW Group, a staunch Hillary Clinton supporter, and <a title="may get a greater role if she is elected" href="http://swampland.time.com/2011/07/20/no-registered-lobbyists-among-top-obama-fundraisers-but-influence-seekers-abound/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may get a greater role if she is elected</a>. Kempner is a member of the Public Relations Hall of Fame. Michael Kempner hired Anthony Weiner after the sexting scandal broke in 2011.</p>
<p>Jeff Shell, chairman of the BBG and Universal Filmed Entertainment is supporting a secondary role by being <a title="an honor roll donor to the Atlantic Council" href="http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/support/supporters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an honor roll donor to the Atlantic Council</a>. While the BBG is supposed to be neutral it has continuously helped increase tensions in Eastern Europe. While giving to the Atlantic Council may not be illegal while in his position, currently, the Atlantic Council’s main effort is to ignite a war with Russia. This may set up a major conflict of interest.</p>
<p><a title="According to journalist Robert Parry" href="https://consortiumnews.com/2016/10/22/washingtons-new-lock-step-march-of-folly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">As journalist Robert Parry wrote in October 2016</a>, the propaganda campaign in favor of military confrontation with Russia was driven by “a consensus among the major think tanks of Official Washington, where there is near universal support for Hillary Clinton, not because they all particularly like her, but because she has signaled a return to neocon/liberal-hawk strategies.”</p>
<p>The people who were lining up to take senior positions in a Clinton White House believed that President Obama had been too timid in stressing the dangers of overreach and the need for restraint, especially in the Middle East, and it was time for a more hawkish approach, as embodied by Clinton.</p>
<p>Parry goes on to say that at the forefront of this propaganda campaign was the Atlantic Council, a think tank associated with NATO. Their main goal was “a major confrontation with nuclear-armed Russia,” Parry warned.</p>
<p>So, to make sense of all this, most of the people listed would have held cabinet positions in a Hillary Clinton presidency. If the Interpreter is a project of RFE/RL then the decision to go ahead with PropOrNot would have to go across their desk. That would include, possibly, then Secretary of State, John Kerry.</p>
<p>The unasked question of why would a U.S. Government Agency do this needs to be addressed. All the people listed above were actively working for Clinton to get her elected and throw Donald Trump’s campaign off the rails.</p>
<p>After the election, they were going to take care of Clinton’s “deplorables” by dissecting alternative media. I wrote about this before the election and I warned several major new sites what they could expect. I was right on the money. After she lost, it was already in motion. The deplorable media didn’t fall into a particular political pattern other than they did not promote Hillary Clinton.</p>
<p><a title="The purpose of Propornot has been to get people to demand freedom of speech be rolled back" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2017/04/vault-7-tools-used-private-contractors-shows-us-intel-needs-ground-rebuild-news-part-2.html">The purpose of PropOrNot has been to trick people into demanding that freedom of speech be rolled back</a>. This was/is to be done by destroying fact-based media. If you read further, the entire plan is laid out starting from 2015 when it started coming together.</p>
<p>These people want reality shaped on what the perceived majority (louder) group believes to be true, regardless of what the facts are. Perception based reality is only a Facebook like away from killing one person or elevating another to hero status regardless of what they have done.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-115214" src="http://theantimedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/image-4.jpg" alt="" width="1011" height="269"></p>
<p>That little statement about the free speech rally says it all. It’s something that would hardly be noticed unless you were looking for it because it is part of the metadata.</p>
<p>Now you can say it’s only a sentence and who cares? Nobody communicates through metadata do they? Wasn’t that what PropOrNot was all about? Yes, they do communicate through metadata. That’s why I look at it.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-115215" src="http://theantimedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/image-5.jpg" alt="" width="942" height="727"></p>
<p>Do you see it? No? Look again. There in the metadata, at the bottom of the image is an ad for a job. Go for it and remember to mention the header. It could just as easily be hacking instructions, or a do not disturb sign. That’s why it pays to really research carefully.</p>
<p>The Boston ‘Free Speech’ Rally was billed by the social networks and MSM as a fascist rally. It was actually a Free Speech Rally. What they learned is that with just a little nudge, they can make you demand nationalist repression. Nice going Boston!</p>
<p>Hey, is this starting to sound a little conspiratorial? If it is, we need Russkie hackers with Guy Fawkes masks to make this work. They have to admit to changing international politics through hacking in 2016, belong to a foreign country, code in Russian, and use spear phishing techniques to lure people in. Let’s not forget that they also have to work for some form of Intelligence.</p>
<p>Most importantly, they have to work with and influence all of the people above. They will definitely impact U.S. foreign policy toward Russia. Let’s raise the stakes even more. The hackers have to answer to whoever is funding a lot of the illegal and immoral activities.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-115216" src="http://theantimedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/image-6.png" alt="" width="675" height="547"></p>
<p>They are not even savvy enough to stay clear of outing each other. This is the Pravy Sektor hacker RUH8.  The common thread for these hackers is clear if you read the linked material on the profiles that make up these organizations. They work for Bellingcat, Informnapalm, the Atlantic Council, Ukrainian Intel, and the Diaspora.</p>
<p>In a follow-up article, I have reason to ask if they were given access to United States Government Top-Secret Secure Servers. I’m not kidding.</p>
<p><a title="In a Euromaidan Press article dated November 2nd, 2016" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2017/01/crowdstrikes-russian-hacking-story-fell-apart-say-hello-fancy-bear-2.html">In a Euromaidan Press article dated Nov. 2, 2016</a>, the hackers state enthusiastically “Ukrainian hackers have a rather high level of work. So the help of the USA… I don’t know, why would we need it? We have all the talent and special means for this. And I don’t think that the USA or any NATO country would make such sharp movements in international politics.”</p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>And we have a winner. In 2016 the sharp movement in international politics was caused by…survey says….hacking!!!!</p>
<p>According to Donna Brazille, the Democratic Party servers were hacked multiple times and the hacking didn’t stop until December 2016. At this juncture, we should be able to agree that Seth Rich leaked the information to Wikileaks. But, now we are talking about other hacks. In the above-linked article, these hacker specifically say their favorite route is spear phishing email accounts.</p>
<p>In the article, you’ll also see they work directly for Ukrainian Intel. Bellingcat works directly for Ukrainian Intel and works with them and the Atlantic Council. Stopfake.org is a product of Irena Chalupa who works for RFE/RL, the Atlantic Council and the Ukrainian government. Stopfake.org works directly with them and is a product of the Ukrainian government. Crowdstrike has an ongoing relationship with Ukrainian Intel and these particular hackers. Is it possible that Crowdstrike conjured up Fancy Bear, the “hacker(s)” responsible for divulging internal Democratic Party emails that supposedly tipped the 2016 election in Trump’s favor? (“Fancy Bear,” by the way, is technically a set of tools, not a person.)</p>
<p>If so, this would mean that approval was given at the highest levels – presumably former Secretary of State John Kerry – for Ukrainian intelligence hackers to have access to servers inside a U.S. Government Agency because of PropOrNot and the Atlantic Council’s reliance on the hackers.</p>
<p>How are the Ukrainian hackers tied into PropOrNot at any level? James Miller isn’t shy about using their work. PropOrNot relies on the work of the Atlantic Council, Aric Toler, Aaron Weisburd, Clint Watts, and Joel Harding. The Ukrainian hackers work directly with InformNapalm and are the go-to resource for most of the people involved and all of the people just named.</p>
<p>As James Miller wrote at the Interpreter, “<a title="Below we have assessed the details of the reports from InformNapalm, and have expanded on their investigation." href="http://www.interpretermag.com/meet-the-russian-fighters-building-a-base-between-mariupol-and-donetsk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Below we have assessed the details of the reports from InformNapalm, and have expanded on their investigation.</a>”</p>
<p>Who does the Atlantic Council work for? It’s the same people who staff RFE/RL and works closely with the Ukrainian World Congress, as explained here:</p>
<p><a title="“On 29 January 2016 in Washington, U.S.A" href="http://www.ukrainianworldcongress.org/news.php/news/1316" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“On 29 January 2016 in Washington, U.S.A</a>., Ukrainian World Congress (UWC) President Eugene Czolij and Atlantic Council President and CEO Frederick Kempe officially signed a Memorandum of Agreement to renew the cooperation between the UWC and the Atlantic Council, which began in September 2014.</p>
<p>“In accordance with this Memorandum, the UWC will continue its cooperation with the Atlantic Council on implementing the “Ukraine in Europe Initiative”, which aims to galvanize international support for an independent, sovereign and territorially integral Ukraine, including Crimea. This initiative is also intended to support reforms in Ukraine and its EuroAtlantic integration, and to counter Russian disinformation.”</p>
<p>The Ukrainian World Congress is represented in the U.S. Congress by the Ukrainian Caucus headed up by <a title="ISIS supporter and Nazi cheerleader Marcy Kaptur" href="http://thesaker.is/democrat-says-americans-owe-nazis-for-suffering-and-gives-isis-eulogy-on-c-span/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ISIS supporter and Nazi cheerleader Marcy Kaptur</a>. Her Ukrainian Caucus represents people with political positions that scared Adolf Hitler in WWII.</p>
<p>The obvious takeaway is that a lawsuit is a bare minimum that needs to happen. People need to be investigated for crimes against the state. When we take a closer look at who had potential access to top-secret servers, which will become painfully clear.</p>
<p>Through their efforts to quash free speech and paint anyone who questions government propaganda as Kremlin stooges, these people are trying to tear the fabric of society into pieces. At the very least, they have earned a good tarring and feathering. When you look at the financial end of this a lawsuit in the billions would barely touch it.</p>
<p>Just one company the Ukrainian Diaspora started for this is valued over 100 million dollars. This will need to be a class action suit with a cease and desist to the BBG.</p>
<p>In early 2015, almost two years before most people took the idea of censorship seriously, I documented its inception. As often happens with many of the biggest stories of our times, I stumbled onto it by accident.</p>
<p><a title="In early March 2015, Ukrainian Information Policy designer Joel Harding" href="https://www.globalresearch.ca/us-psychological-warfare-in-ukraine-targeting-online-independent-media-coverage/5437883" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In early March 2015, Ukrainian Information Policy designer Joel Harding</a> laid out what to expect going forward in the following statements: “In military IIO [Inform and Influence Operations] center on the ability to influence foreign audiences, US, and global audiences, and adversely affect enemy decision making through an integrated approach. Even current event news is released in this fashion. Each portal is given messages that follow the same themes because it is an across the board mainstream effort that fills the information space entirely when it is working correctly.”</p>
<p>The purpose of “<a title="Inform and Influence Operations”&amp;nbsp;" href="http://toinformistoinfluence.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Inform and Influence Operations”</a> is not to provide a perspective, opinion, or lay out a policy. It is defined as the ability to make audiences “think and act” in a manner favorable to the mission objectives. This is done through applying perception management techniques which target the audience’s emotions, motives, and reasoning.</p>
<p>These techniques are not geared for debate. It is to overwhelm and change the target psyche.</p>
<p>Using these techniques information sources can be manipulated and those that write, speak, or think counter to the objective are relegated as propaganda, ill-informed, or irrelevant.</p>
<p>While the above sounds gloriously overoptimistic, Harding, along with his little band of Kremlin Troll hunters personally started developing the idea of organizations capable of blackballing journalists and publications in a way that could not be construed as censorship.</p>
<p><a title="From another March 2015 article" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2015/03/weaponizing-wikipedia-invasion-scale-info-war.html">From another March 2015 article</a> – <a title="A “Disinformation Charter” for Media and Bloggers" href="http://toinformistoinfluence.com/2014/11/16/ru-information-warfare-the-kremlin-tool-kit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A “Disinformation Charter” for Media and Bloggers</a>: “Top-down censorship should be avoided. But rival media, from Al-Jazeera to the BBC, Fox and beyond, need to get together to create a charter of acceptable and unacceptable behavior. Vigorous debate and disagreement are, of course, to be encouraged – but media organizations that practice conscious deception should be excluded from the community. A similar code can be accepted by bloggers and other online influencers.”</p>
<p>This “Disinformation Charter” for responsible behavior (Ministry of Truth?) he describes is to fight “conscious deception” can only be weighed against how he describes <a title="Propaganda." href="http://toinformistoinfluence.com/2011/10/04/where-to-get-objective-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Propaganda.</a> “The word is frequently used to describe any news emerging one’s opponent,” according to Harding.</p>
<p>Journalists who need to be excluded are those “our side” label as propagandists or active measure agents.”</p>
<p>Harding’s connections in media are huge. Through his friend Matthew Armstrong, Harding had access to and the ear of the board of the Broadcasting Board of Governors, staffed by a who’s who of network and radio broadcast, print media and shortwave CEOs and heavy hitters. They are the ones behind RFE/RL.</p>
<p>On the other end of this in 2015, <a title="Joel Harding was assembling a group of miscreants" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2015/10/privatized-nsa-army-is-attacking-you.html">Joel Harding was assembling a group of miscreants</a> to attack the social networks of different journalist and publications. <a title="The crude logic behind a direct assault" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2015/10/weisburds-world-american-jihadi-targeting-americans-in-us.html">The crude logic behind a direct assault</a> was that by developing, training, and <a title="overseeing vast troll networks" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2015/10/ukraine-cyber-mercenaries-attack-antiwar-com.html">overseeing vast troll networks</a> they could speak over their opposition (people that their employers wanted to be silenced) and subdue dissident online conversation and control the information.</p>
<p>Where this wasn’t feasible, they set up hack and harass attacks at various publications to get them to stop publishing hard-hitting journalists. This still hasn’t been entirely effective because it caused publishers to dig in and harden their internet properties instead.</p>
<p>The softer more indirect approach Harding pushed in March 2015 quickly developed into the unified media strategy he wanted for the U.S. and Europe. Control the information and don’t allow contradicting information or news into the media stream. When it does get in, call it propaganda.</p>

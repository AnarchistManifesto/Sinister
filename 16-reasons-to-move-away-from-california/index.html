<div class="post-bodycopy clearfix">
Once  upon a time, millions upon millions of young people dreamed of moving  to California.  Nearly endless sunshine, pristine beaches and a booming  economy made it seem like paradise to many.  But now those days are long  gone.</p>
<p>Unemployment is rampant, home prices have fallen like a rock,  violent crime and gang activity are on the rise, local governments all  over California are facing horrible financial problems, millions of  illegal immigrants have poured into the state, traffic around the big  cities is nightmarish and tax rates are absolutely outrageous.</p>
<p>Plus  there is the constant threat that your home could be destroyed by an  earthquake, a wildfire or a mudslide.  In recent years, hordes of hard  working families have decided that they have had enough and have decided  to move away from California.  In fact, since the year 2000 <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303302504577323353434618474.html?KEYWORDS=WENDELL%252BCOX" target="_blank" title="more than 1.6 million people">more than 1.6 million people</a> have moved away from the state of California.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>There are still a few pockets of the state that are still very  beautiful and that have been sheltered from the economic nightmare that  is sweeping the rest of the state.</p>
<div align="center">
</div>
<p>
But in general, most cities in California are rapidly becoming giant hellholes.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, the “California Dream” has now become a “California Nightmare” for most residents of the state.</p>
<p>Do you live in California?  If so, perhaps now is the time to move.   The following are 16 really good reasons to move away from  California….</p>
<p><b>#1 California Is Run By Elitist Control Freaks That Have No Common Sense At All</b><br />
Politicians in California seem to love to impose absolutely  ridiculous rules and regulations on the taxpayers.  For example, many  local governments in the state are now seeking to require that most new  housing be built with at least 20 units on a single acre.  This gives  the phrase “being close with your neighbors” a whole new meaning.  The  following is from a recent <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303302504577323353434618474.html?KEYWORDS=WENDELL%252BCOX" target="_blank" title="Wall Street Journal article">Wall Street Journal article</a>….</p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<ins class="adsbygoogle"
     style="display:block; text-align:center;"
     data-ad-layout="in-article"

<p>
<i>Metropolitan area governments are adopting plans that  would require most new housing to be built at 20 or more to the acre,  which is at least five times the traditional quarter acre per house.  State and regional planners also seek to radically restructure urban  areas, forcing much of the new hyperdensity development into narrowly  confined corridors.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are many more examples of this “control freak” mentality.  As I wrote about <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/19-signs-that-america-has-become-a-crazy-control-freak-nation-where-almost-everything-is-illegal" title="recently">recently</a>, one California town is actually considering making it illegal to smoke <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2106269/Rocklin-California-town-ban-smoking-ANYWHERE-outside-backyard.html" target="_blank" title="in your own backyard">in your own backyard</a>.<br />
In some California cities you even need to get permission from the  government to gather with your friends.  For example, in San Juan  Capistrano it is actually illegal to hold a home Bible study without a “<a href="http://www.wnd.com/2011/09/345073/" target="_blank" title="conditional use permit">conditional use permit</a>“.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/hideguns.html" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 0em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" src="https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/hideguns150x200.jpg"></a><b>#2 California Is A Horrible Place To Do Business</b><br />
For <a href="http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2011/05/06/113785/texas-is-best-california-worst.html" target="_blank" title="seven years in a row">seven years in a row</a>,  CEOs ranked California as the worst place in the United States to do  business.  Thousands of good companies have left the state in recent  years, and yet California lawmakers continue to pile on more rules,  regulations and taxes.</p>
<p><b>#3 The California Economy Is A Gigantic Mess</b><br />
The unemployment rate in California is still <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/46783384" target="_blank" title="well above 10 percent">well above 10 percent</a>.   In fact, the number of people unemployed in the state of California is  approximately equivalent to the populations of Nevada, New Hampshire and  Vermont <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/california-is-broke-19-reasons-why-it-may-be-time-for-everyone-to-leave-the-state-of-california-for-good" target="_blank" title="combined">combined</a>.  In 2010, only about <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2011/04/14/shock-employment-figures-fewer-than-half-of-americans-have-jobs/" target="_blank" title="37 percent">37 percent</a> of the entire population of the state of California had a job.</p>
<p><b>#4 Municipalities All Over California Are Going Broke And Will Soon Need To Raise Taxes Substantially Just To Survive</b><br />
Did you know that Stockton, California is so broke that it recently started skipping debt payments?  The following is from a <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/04/17/usa-defaults-outlook-idUKL1E8EN2V520120417" target="_blank" title="recent Reuters article">recent Reuters article</a>….</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Badly hit by the burst of the property boom,  California’s Stockton, with 292,000 people and east of San Francisco,  has endorsed defaults on $2 million of debt payments and may file for  municipal bankruptcy if it cannot reach deals with creditors. The  California ski resort, Mammoth Lakes, is also bargaining with creditors  in a bid to avoid bankruptcy.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But as bad as Stockton is doing, the truth is that Orange County may  be in even worse shape.  The following is from a recent article <a href="http://www.testosteronepit.com/home/2012/4/16/chriss-street-orange-countys-iceberg-dead-ahead.html" target="_blank" title="by Chriss Street">by Chriss Street</a>….</p>
<blockquote>

<i>Like the Titanic a hundred years ago that ignored  warnings and ran full-speed into a massive iceberg, Orange County is  taking enormous financial risks rather than addressing its gaping  cash-flow deficit.

<p><b>#5 Desperate Municipalities Are Severely Slashing Government Services All Over The State</b><br />
When you have no more money, you have to start cutting somewhere.  In  many cities in California, government services are being curtailed  dramatically.  Just check out what is going on in <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/46783384/page/2/" target="_blank" title="from California">Costa Mesa</a>….</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Costa Mesa, a city of 110,000 south of Los Angeles,  has slashed its payroll from 611 to 450. It is selling its police  helicopters and has hired a neighboring city for air patrols. It’s also  pursuing a controversial effort to convert to a charter city from a  general law city, which would give City Hall more power to outsource  more work, said councilman Jim Righeimer.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Oakland things got so bad that the police chief announced at one point that his department would <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/will-thousands-of-police-layoffs-unleash-chaos-and-anarchy-across-america" target="_blank" title="no longer respond">no longer respond</a>  to certain crimes.  The list of crimes included grand theft, burglary,  car wrecks, identity theft and vandalism.  Today, Oakland is considered <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/11/22/most-dangerous-cities-in-_n_787010.html#s188480&amp;title=5_Oakland_California" target="_blank" title="the 5th most violent city">the 5th most violent city</a> in the United States.</p>
<p>In Stockton the budget cuts got so bad that the police union put up a  billboard at one point with the<br />
following message: “Welcome to the 2nd  most dangerous city in California. Stop laying off cops.”</p>
<p><b>#6 The State Government In Sacramento Is Flat Broke</b><br />
Earlier this year, newspapers all over the state ran headlines declaring that <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2012/01/31/MNHF1N10BT.DTL" target="_blank" title="California is running out of money again">California is running out of money again</a>.   Tax revenues are way down as many expenses continue to rise.   California state government revenues for February 2012 were down <a href="http://www.economicnoise.com/2012/03/16/california-imploding-just-like-greece/" target="_blank" title="by about 22 percent">by about 22 percent</a> compared to February 2011.<br />
Will California soon be paying their bills with IOUs again?</p>
<p>California taxpayers should realize that it is only a matter of time  before lawmakers try to hit them with more tax increases of one form or  another.</p>
<p><b>#7 California Has Some Of The Highest Tax Rates In The Nation</b><br />
The last thing many California taxpayers want to hear is that taxes  might be raised again.  Californians already get absolutely hammered by  taxes. California has one of the highest state income tax rates in the  nation, one of the highest sales tax rates in the nation and the highest  gasoline tax rate in the nation.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it is only a matter of time before the politicians come around for even more.</p>
<p><b>#8 Poverty Is Absolutely Exploding In California</b><br />
<a href="http://activistpost.net/quicksafe.html" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-P0ZlXZyjyOQ/TqRErsNzzmI/AAAAAAAALqo/imuoPMs_yWw/s200/loaded.jpg"></a>Once upon a time, California was viewed as a land of great opportunity. Now it is a land of crushing poverty in many areas. Sadly, the number of children living in poverty in the state of California has increased <a href="http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/Millions-More-California-Children-Slip-into-Poverty-134842133.html" target="_blank" title="by 30 percent">by a staggering 30 percent</a> since 2007.

<p><b>#9 Epidemic Of Crime And Gang Violence </b><br />
Many families are deciding to move away from California because there are fewer and fewer areas that are still safe. For example, the following story from Rancho Cordova, California that one of my readers sent me was featured <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/is-now-the-time-to-move-away-from-major-u-s-cities" title="in one of my previous articles">in one of my previous articles</a>….</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>When I first moved here, it was not a bad place, it was quiet and clean.</i> </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>However, over the past three years this place has gone to the dumps there are thugs and unruly people everywhere.</i> </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>I have prevented two car break-ins by scaring these thugs away.</i> </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>While I was home on thanksgiving weekend, someone decided to break into my apartment.</i> </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>They trashed my place stole all my items and even took my law enforcement (LE) vehicle to include my equipment.</i> </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>I’m sure they had been watching me for a while because they did not take items that contained my identification.</i> </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Thank god, I had my weapon with me.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fortunately the gentleman in that story was not there when his home  was broken into.  Thieves are becoming bolder and bolder and many home  invasions happen whether there are occupants in the home or not.</p>
<p>The following <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/10-shocking-home-invasion-horror-stories-that-are-almost-too-creepy-to-believe" title="home invasion story">home invasion story</a> from Sacramento, California was sent to me by one of my readers a while back….</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Somebody got into my sister’s house last night while  she was out. My mom was upstairs, but didn’t hear anything. Whoever it  was, they ate some chips and sorted through a stack of maternity clothes  my sister had ready for selling on ebay. He left a dirty pair of boxer  shorts and a bottom dentures on the dining room table. Fortunately, he  was gone when she got home. I’m amazed, but the police actually came out  and collected fingerprints and his boxers and false teeth. Probably a  homeless guy. He may have switched his dirty boxers for a clean pair of  maternity jeans, so the police just have to look for a guy wearing  women’s maternity pants with no lower teeth. </i></p>

<p>Who does that kind of thing?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when people get desperate they tend to throw out the normal rules that most of us live by.</p>
<p>Every state has crime, but things are getting particularly bad in  California.  A reader that works in law enforcement down in the Los  Angeles area left the following comment <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/22-facts-about-california-that-make-you-wonder-why-anyone-would-still-want-to-live-in-that-hellhole-of-a-state" title="on a recent article">on a recent article</a>….</p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>Another reader identified as Rob left the following comment….</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>I have lived here off and on for 42 years. Hellhole  is not strong enough a word for it. One cannot go anywhere without  seeing Graffitti from these gangs. Illegal Aliens are literally on every  corner and every home depot. LA County alone spent 600 million in aid  to illegal aliens not including education being factored in and the  state spent 110 billion last year on just programs, welfare, aid to  illegal entitlement programs, no ******** wonder why we are broke, the  liberal agenda out here is astonishing, these liberals literally  couldn’t see the forest through the trees. I am so sick of seeing  Nortenos, Surenos, LaFamilia, and other hispanic gangs crowding our  prisons, illegals underage having their anchor babies, illegals crowding  the ER’s, crowding the schools. No wonder why the teachers are pissed  off. I agree, this state sucks, and we will be moving very soon.</i></p>

<p><b>#10 As Poverty And Crime Grow Many California Cities Are Being Transformed Into Hellholes</b><br />
Nature abhors a vacuum.  As successful businesses and hard working  families move away from California, other elements are moving in to  replace them.  Many formerly great California cities are now just a  shell of their former selves.  The following is an excerpt <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/06/magazine/06Muni-t.html?_r=1" target="_blank" title="from a recent New York Times article">from a New York Times article</a> that describes what is going on in Vallejo, California….</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Vallejo is still in bankruptcy. The police force has  shrunk from 153 officers to 92. Calls for any but the most serious  crimes go unanswered. Residents who complain about prostitutes or  vandals are told to fill out a form. Three of the city’s firehouses were  closed. Last summer, a fire ravaged a house in one of the city’s better  neighborhoods; one of the firetrucks came from another town, 15 miles  away. Is this America’s future?</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are some parts of large California cities that are an absolute  nightmare.  For example, there is an area of San Francisco that is known  as “Hunter’s Point” that is so run down that it is hard to believe that  people actually live there.  The following is what <a href="http://www.sfbg.com/40/03/news_despair.html" target="_blank" title="one reporter">one reporter</a> discovered on a visit to Hunter’s Point….</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Abernathy and I cut through the complex, tromping  over an expanse of dirt and concrete toward the northeast end of the  development, where a row of apartments looked down from a grassy hill.  We paused next to a vacant, boarded-over unit to take in the scene: A  stream of ****, piss, tampons, and toilet paper spewed from a dark hole  in the sidewalk, poured down the hill, and formed a sort of **** lagoon  next to the street. Weeds, about six inches tall, were growing in the  little lagoon.</i> </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Raw ****, obviously, is not cool. Beyond the fact that it smells  and looks nasty, fecal matter provides a haven for dangerous bacteria,  most notably E. coli, a virulent pathogen that can sicken and even kill  humans, especially infants.<br />

<p><b>#11 California Has Some Of The Worst Schools In The Nation</b><br />
Many families are moving away from California because the public  schools are absolutely nightmarish.  The truth is that California has  some of the worst schools in the entire nation.  In the late 70s,  California was number one in per-pupil spending on education, but now  the state has fallen <a href="http://www.beyondchron.org/articles/First_Solve_Prison_Crisis_then_Fix_California_s_Budget_7915.html" target="_blank" title="to 48th place">to 48th place</a>.</p>
<p><b>#12 Political Correctness Runs Rampant In California</b><br />
In California, control freaks love to run for public office, and once  they get power they love to shove their personal agendas down the  throats of everyone else.  According to <a href="http://cnsnews.com/news/article/california-public-school-kids-now-required-study-contributions-lgbt-americans" target="_blank" title="CNSNews.com">CNSNews.com</a>, one new California law actually makes it <b>mandatory</b>  for all public school children to receive instruction on the “role and  contributions” that “lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender Americans”  have played in the “development of California and the United States of  America.”</p>
<p><b>#13 California Does Not Respect The Rights Of Parents</b><br />
Over and over, the state of California has shown that it could not  care less about the rights of parents.  For example, according to <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/033629_vaccinations_parental_consent.html" target="_blank" title="Natural News">Natural News</a>  a bill was recently passed in the state of California that allows  health officials to vaccinate children as young as 12 for  sexually-transmitted diseases without ever having to get the approval of  the parents….</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>California’s Assembly Bill 499 has already quietly  passed both the California House and Senate, and today sits on the desk  of Gov. Jerry Brown where it awaits his signature. The bill, which is  only a single page in length, contains specific language that will allow  children as young as 12 to opt for sexually-transmitted disease (STD)  vaccines like HPV (Gardasil, Cervarix), Hepatitis B, and any future  vaccines developed to treat STDs, without having to attain parental  consent.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>#14 California Has One Of The Worst Health Care Systems In America</b><br />
All over California, hospitals are shutting down.  A big reason for  this is because of the massive numbers of poor people and illegal aliens  that are taking advantage of “free” medical care at hospital emergency  rooms.  A number of good hospitals have been forced to shut down in  recent years and now the state of California ranks <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/why-california-is-the-next-greece-2010-05#california-has-americas-fewest-7-emergency-rooms-per-one-million-people-6" target="_blank" title="dead last">dead last</a> out of all 50 states in the number of emergency rooms per million people.</p>
<p><b>#15 California – The Land Of The Lawsuits</b><br />
If you live in the state of California, there is a really good chance  that you will be slapped with a lawsuit at some point.  According to  the Institute for Legal Reform, the “lawsuit climate” in California <a href="http://www.instituteforlegalreform.com/component/ilr_featured_tools/29/item/LAI/19.html" target="_blank" title="is ranked number 46">is ranked number 46</a> out of all 50 states.</p>
<p><b>#16 The “Big One” Could Hit California At Any Time</b><br />
The state of California lies directly along the infamous “<a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/the-ring-of-fire-is-roaring-to-life-and-there-will-be-earthquakes-of-historic-importance-on-the-west-coast-of-the-united-states" title="Ring of Fire">Ring of Fire</a>“.   Approximately 90 percent of all the earthquakes in the world happen  along the Ring of Fire and the “Big One” could hit the state at any  moment.</p>

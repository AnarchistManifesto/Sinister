<p>The U.S. health care system is a giant money making scam that is designed to drain as much money as possible out of all of us before we die.  In the United States today, the health care industry is completely dominated by government bureaucrats, health insurance companies and pharmaceutical corporations.  The pharmaceutical corporations spend billions of dollars to convince all of us to become dependent on their legal drugs, the health insurance companies make billions of dollars by providing as little health care as possible, and they both spend millions of dollars to make sure that our politicians in Washington D.C. keep the gravy train rolling.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, large numbers of doctors are going broke and patients are not getting the care that they need.  At this point, our health care system is a complete and total disaster.  Health care costs continue to go up rapidly, the level of care that we are receiving continues to go down, and every move that our politicians make just seems to make all of our health care problems even worse.</p>
<p>In America today, a single trip to the emergency room can easily cost you $100,000, and if you happen to get cancer you could end up with medical bills in excess of a million dollars.  Even if you do have health insurance, there are usually limits on your coverage, and the truth is that just a single major illness is often enough to push most American families into bankruptcy.  At the same time, hospital administrators, pharmaceutical corporations and health insurance company executives are absolutely swimming in huge mountains of cash.  Unfortunately, this gigantic money making scam has become so large that it threatens to collapse both the U.S. health care system and the entire U.S. economy.</p>
<p>The following are 50 signs that the U.S. health care system is a massive money making scam that is about to collapse…</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>#1 Medical bills have become so ridiculously large that virtually nobody can afford them.  Just check out the following short excerpt from a recent <a href="http://healthland.time.com/2013/02/20/bitter-pill-why-medical-bills-are-killing-us/6/">Time Magazine article</a>.</p>
<div align="center">

<p>
One man in California that had been diagnosed with cancer ran up nearly a million dollars in hospital bills before he died…</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>By the time Steven D. died at his home in Northern California the following November, he had lived for an additional 11 months. And Alice had collected bills totaling $902,452. The family’s first bill — for $348,000 — which arrived when Steven got home from the Seton Medical Center in Daly City, Calif., was full of all the usual chargemaster profit grabs: $18 each for 88 diabetes-test strips that Amazon sells in boxes of 50 for $27.85; $24 each for 19 niacin pills that are sold in drugstores for about a nickel apiece. There were also four boxes of sterile gauze pads for $77 each. None of that was considered part of what was provided in return for Seton’s facility charge for the intensive-care unit for two days at $13,225 a day, 12 days in the critical unit at $7,315 a day and one day in a standard room (all of which totaled $120,116 over 15 days). There was also $20,886 for CT scans and $24,251 for lab work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>#2 This year the American people will spend approximately <a href="http://healthland.time.com/2013/02/20/bitter-pill-why-medical-bills-are-killing-us/?hpt=hp_c1">2.8 trillion dollars</a> on health care, and it is being projected that Americans will spend <a href="http://swampland.time.com/2010/02/04/the-unsustainable-u-s-health-care-system/">4.5 trillion dollars</a> on health care in 2019.</p>
<p>#3 The United States <a href="http://healthland.time.com/2013/02/20/bitter-pill-why-medical-bills-are-killing-us/?hpt=hp_c1">spends more on health care</a> than Japan, Germany, France, China, the U.K., Italy, Canada, Brazil, Spain and Australia combined.</p>
<p>#4 If the U.S. health care system was a country, it would be <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/depressing-facts-about-healthcare-system-2011-6#if-our-health-care-system-were-its-own-country-it-would-be-the-sixth-largest-economy-in-the-world-29">the 6th largest economy</a> on the entire planet.</p>
<p>#5 Back in 1960, an average of <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/more-evidence-obamacare-ripped-off-americans/5322609">$147</a> was spent per person on health care in the United States. By 2009, that number had skyrocketed to<a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/more-evidence-obamacare-ripped-off-americans/5322609">$8,086</a>.</p>
<p>#6 Why does it cost so much to stay in a hospital today?  It just does not make sense.  Just check out <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/more-evidence-obamacare-ripped-off-americans/5322609">these numbers</a>…</p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>In December, when the New York Times ran a story about how a deficit deal might threaten hospital payments, Steven Safyer, chief executive of Montefiore Medical Center, a large nonprofit hospital system in the Bronx, complained, “There is no such thing as a cut to a provider that isn’t a cut to a beneficiary … This is not crying wolf.” </p>

<p>Actually, Safyer seems to be crying wolf to the tune of about $196.8 million, according to the hospital’s latest publicly available tax return. That was his hospital’s operating profit, according to its 2010 return. With $2.586 billion in revenue — of which 99.4% came from patient bills and 0.6% from fundraising events and other charitable contributions — Safyer’s business is more than six times as large as that of the Bronx’s most famous enterprise, the New York Yankees. Surely, without cutting services to beneficiaries, Safyer could cut what have to be some of the Bronx’s better non-Yankee salaries: his own, which was $4,065,000, or those of his chief financial officer ($3,243,000), his executive vice president ($2,220,000) or the head of his dental department ($1,798,000).</p>

<p>#42 It has been estimated that hospitals overcharge Americans <a href="http://www.thirdage.com/general-money/how-to-avoid-outrageous-hospital-overcharges">by about 10 billion dollars</a> every single year.</p>
<p>#43 One trained medical billing advocate says that over 90 percent of the medical bills that she has audited contain “<a href="http://www.thirdage.com/general-money/how-to-avoid-outrageous-hospital-overcharges">gross overcharges</a>“.</p>
<p>#44 It is not uncommon for insurance companies to get hospitals to knock their bills down <a href="http://tpmcafe.talkingpointsmemo.com/talk/blogs/candide/2009/06/this-is-how-ridiculous-our-med.php">by up to 95 percent</a>, but if you are uninsured or you don’t know how the system works then you are out of luck.</p>

<p>#47 Back in 1965, only one out of every 50 Americans was on Medicaid.  Today, <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/mary-meeker-usa-inc-february-24-2011-2">one out of every 6</a> Americans is on Medicaid.</p>

<p>#49 When Medicare was first established by Congress, it was estimated that it would cost the federal government <a href="http://healthland.time.com/2013/02/20/bitter-pill-why-medical-bills-are-killing-us/9/">$12 billion</a> a year by the time 1990 rolled around.  Instead, it cost the federal government <a href="http://healthland.time.com/2013/02/20/bitter-pill-why-medical-bills-are-killing-us/9/">$110 billion</a> in 1990, and it will cost the federal government close to <a href="http://healthland.time.com/2013/02/20/bitter-pill-why-medical-bills-are-killing-us/9/">$600 billion</a> this year.</p>
<p>#50 Even if you do have health insurance, that is no guarantee that medical bills will not bankrupt you.  Just check out what a recent <a href="http://healthland.time.com/2013/02/20/bitter-pill-why-medical-bills-are-killing-us/?hpt=hp_c1">Time Magazine article</a> says happened to one unfortunate couple from Ohio that actually did have health insurance…</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>When Sean Recchi, a 42-year-old from Lancaster, Ohio, was told last March that he had non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, his wife Stephanie knew she had to get him to MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. Stephanie’s father had been treated there 10 years earlier, and she and her family credited the doctors and nurses at MD Anderson with extending his life by at least eight years. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>Because Stephanie and her husband had recently started their own small technology business, they were unable to buy comprehensive health insurance. For $469 a month, or about 20% of their income, they had been able to get only a policy that covered just $2,000 per day of any hospital costs. “We don’t take that kind of discount insurance,” said the woman at MD Anderson when Stephanie called to make an appointment for Sean. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>Stephanie was then told by a billing clerk that the estimated cost of Sean’s visit — just to be examined for six days so a treatment plan could be devised — would be $48,900, due in advance.</p>

<p>By the way, that hospital down in Houston made a profit of <a href="http://healthland.time.com/2013/02/20/bitter-pill-why-medical-bills-are-killing-us/?hpt=hp_c1">531 million dollars</a> in one recent year.</p>
<p>So what can be done about all of this?</p>
<p>Well, the truth is that the status quo is a complete and total disaster, and every “solution” being promoted by politicians from both major political parties would only make things worse.</p>
<p>In the end, the U.S. health care system needs to be rebuilt from the ground up, but we all know that is not going to happen.</p>
<p>Instead, our politicians and the health care industry will just find additional ways to extract money from all of us, and the level of care that we all get will continue to decline.</p>
<p>If you don’t believe this, just check out what Paul Krugman of the New York Times <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/02/04/Krugman-Death-panels-and-sales-taxes-is-how-we-do-this">had to say recently</a>…</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>We’re going to need more revenue…Surely it will require some sort of middle class taxes as well.. We won’t be able to pay for the kind of government the society will want without some increase in taxes… on the middle class, maybe a value added tax…And we’re also going to have to make decisions about health care, doc pay for health care that has no demonstrated medical benefits . So the snarky version…which I shouldn’t even say because it will get me in trouble is death panels and sales taxes is how we do this.</p>

<p>In the end, my philosophy is just to avoid the U.S. health care system as much as possible.  Most doctors are just trained to do two things – prescribe drugs and cut you open.  In an emergency situation where you are about to die, those may be your best options, but otherwise I would just as soon avoid the gigantic money making scam that the U.S. health care industry has become.</p>
<p>But just don’t take my word for it.  The following is some very sound advice <a href="http://lewrockwell.com/roberts/roberts357.html">from Dr. Robert S. Dotson</a>…</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>Avoid contact with the existing health care system as far as possible. Yes, emergencies arise that require the help of physicians, but by and large one can learn to care for one’s own minor issues. Though it is flawed, the internet has been an information leveler for the masses and permits each person to be his or her own physician to a large degree. Take advantage of it! Educate yourself about your own body and learn to fuel and maintain it as you would an expensive auto or a pet poodle. One does not need a medical degree to:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>1. avoid excessive use of tobacco or alcohol or, for that matter, caffeine;<br />
2. avoid poisons like fluoride, aspartame, high fructose corn syrup, and addictive drugs (legal or illicit);<br />
3. avoid unnecessary and potentially lethal imaging studies (TSA’s radiation pornbooths, excessive mammography, repetitive CT scans – exposure to all significantly increases cancer risk);<br />
4. avoid excessive cell phone use and exposure to other forms of EMR pollution where possible (the NSA is recording everything you say and text anyway);<br />
5. avoid daily fast food use and abuse (remember: pink slime and silicone) ;<br />
6. avoid untested GM foods (do you really want to become “Roundup Ready?”):<br />
7. avoid most vaccinations and pharmaceutical agents promoted by the establishment;<br />
8. avoid risky behaviors (and, we do not need a bunch of Nanny State bureaucrats to define and police these);<br />
9. exercise moderately;<br />
10. get plenty of sleep;<br />
11. drink plenty of good quality water (buy a decent water filter to remove fluoride, chloride, and heavy metals);<br />
12. wear protective gear at work and play where appropriate (helmets, eye-shields, knee and elbow pads, etc.):<br />
13. seek out locally-grown, whole, organic foods and support your local food producers;<br />
14. take appropriate nutritional supplements (multi-vitamins, Vitamin C, Vitamin D3);<br />
15. switch off the TV and the mainstream media it represents;<br />
16. educate yourself while you can; </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>And, lastly…<br />
17. QUESTION AUTHORITY! </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>Doing these simple, common-sense things will add healthy years to a person’s life and help one avoid most medical encounters during his or her allotted time on earth.</p>

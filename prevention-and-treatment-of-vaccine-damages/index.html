<b><a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2013/04/prevention-and-treatment-of-vaccine.html">Activist Post</a></b></p>
<p>Cruelty toward babies starts at birth. It really starts before birth but that is another tale. Many parents have heard horror stories, and have serious doubts about vaccinating. Even that first injection of <a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/article/infant-vitamin-k-injections-are-associated-increased-risk-acute-lymphoblastic-leukaemia">vitamin K is not without risk and danger</a>. This article is for parents in the situation where they are forced into a corner for one of many reasons and feel like they have to vaccinate their children.</p>
<p>Often one parent is against and the other for vaccination. In the context of Humane Pediatrics it is strongly advised to avoid vaccines altogether so as to avoid the threatening edifice of medical and health complications that can stem from them. It should be obvious to the humane among us that it is also to avoid a type of suffering we should not wish on our dearest enemies – that of having to deal with a <a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/disease/vaccine-induced-toxicity">vaccine-damaged child</a>.</p>
<p>This is also for adults who might have to take a vaccination to travel or for healthcare workers in hospitals and others in the military who are given little to no choice. You could find yourself someday with the army at the door and you better roll up your sleeve real quick and try to smile while you are freaking out.</p>
<p>Everyone should understand and know what can be done before, during and after vaccination to mitigate collateral damages, which are sometimes quite severe and much more frequent then federal health officials want you to know. Many parents have expressed fear of having their child become autistic, defective or neurologically damaged.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>No one wants to put their child in harm’s way but powerful pharmaceutical interests have total control of the media and are able to literally herd 90 percent of the population into vaccination clinics. With the <a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/shocking-lack-evidence-supporting-flu-vaccines">yearly flu vaccine</a> the percentages are much less and there is mounting resistance to its insistence by the medical overlords who hang their pictures at the World Health Organization (WHO).</p>
<div align="center">
<p>    <ins class="adsbygoogle" style="height: 90px;width: 728px"></ins><br />
    <a href="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js">//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js</a><br />

</div>
<p>
Certainly no parent wants to see their child go from healthy to physically or mentally handicapped in a matter of months. And for sure no one wants to be in the place of a parent whose child turns blue in their arms and dies hours after receiving multiple vaccinations. Any <a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/anti-therapeutic-action/vaccination-all">harm suffered from vaccines</a> is a cruelty to heart, body, mind and soul. It is an attack of brutality and arrogance injected directly into the bloodstream with steel needles by people in white coats who will react quite violently if you refuse their vaccines. I have a name for this process – rape – chemical rape of a person’s or a child’s vulnerability.</p>
<p>Few independent studies have been conducted into their long-term side effects of vaccines administered to our children. The government says they are safe but we do not really know this; it’s just what we are told. It is just what they say and we are supposed to believe them. The information is out there, especially in the area of medicine and public health, that clearly demonstrates that those people in whom we put our trust cannot and should not be trusted. Institutionalized medicine is not about medicine anymore, it’s about money and power and hurting more people than it helps.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/vaccinetruth.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" height="175" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-38G3VOJQToQ/TfAZ2bc-qRI/AAAAAAAAJQ8/LA-TGAvVeWk/250x250-b.jpg" width="200"></a>The deliberate injection of poisons into humans, mandated by public health officials and medical organizations and performed by all the doctors and nurses who follow them, is inhumane and immoral. Numerous toxins, including mercury and aluminum, are in most commonly administered vaccines. Some doctors are sounding the alarm and there is a chorus of warnings indicating that vaccine damages can lead to cases of autism, multiple sclerosis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, macrophagic myofasciitis, encephalitis, paralysis and neuropathies. The vast majority of the medical professionals, however, reject the notion of any potential toxicity in vaccines and freely administer them to children no matter what the consequence.</p>
<p>Cancer is thought by some to occasionally be initiated in children by vaccines and even the vitamin K injection[1] at birth is thought to be unnecessary and dangerous in this regard. The British Journal of Cancer published a report entitled “Factors Associated with Childhood Cancer”by J. Golding, et al in 1990, which indicated that universally administered IM vitamin K injections significantly increase our children’s chances of developing childhood cancer. The poisoning and destruction of the immune system starts in the first hours of life, even before they clobber the children with the dangerous hepatitis B vaccine several hours later. Here in Brazil, for instance, that vaccine has a megadose of thimerosal in it as does the yearly flu shot that is given all over the world.</p>
<p>That’s right these medical monsters from hell (you can find a good concentration of them at the WHO) are injecting people everywhere with organic mercury, a potent neurotoxin and we wonder why most people cannot think straight these days.</p>
<p>Don’t think there is anything to worry about? As of January 8, 2010, VAERS had received 7814 adverse event reports following 2009 monovalent H1N1 vaccination. Of the 7814 reports, 477 (6%) were reports that were classified as “serious” health events (defined as life-threatening or resulting in death). Among the 477 reports of serious health events, there were 33 reports of death. The National Vaccine Information Center (NVIC) reported that, “In New York, only one out of 40 doctors’ offices (2.5%) confirmed that they report a death or injury following vaccination.” That means 97.5% of vaccine-related deaths and disabilities go unreported there. Implications about the integrity of medical professionals aside (doctors are legally required to report serious adverse events), these findings suggest that <a href="http://www.relfe.com/vaccine.html">vaccine deaths actually occurring each year may be well over 1,000</a>.”</p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p><b>Taking Steps to Defend Your Loved Ones</b></p>
<p>There are steps you can take to minimize the damage if you have to take or give a vaccine to your children. If the government has its way it will force you to take vaccines whether you like it or not. It has already happened that parents in Maryland were forced to vaccinate their children, and men with guns were present where everyone was forced to gather to receive the shots.[2] So it is important to understand some basic information with regard to protecting your children.</p>
<p>Vaccines can send immune systems into overdrive and cause one’s inflammatory response to go haywire; our goal, in part, should be to direct attention to the body’s immune reaction. After vaccinations, T-helper lymphocytes have also been known to fall to levels seen in active AIDS patients, indicating a very real danger of immune system dysfunction following an injection of hostile chemicals directly into the blood.</p>
<p>According to Dr. Mohammed Al-Bayati,[3] “Damage to the immune system is rapidly reversible after removal of the true insulting agent or treatment of the true causes. Atrophy in the lymphoid tissue in people suffering from malnutrition has been known since 1925. Malnutrition causes severe atrophy in the thymus and lymphoid organs and impairs the function of the T-cells. These changes are reversible by feeding. The size of the thymus in malnourished children increased from 20% of normal to 107% of normal, following nine weeks of feeding.”</p>
<p>There are many factors that contribute to immune deficiency and destruction. The central denominator is the introduction of toxic chemical compounds into the body through foods laced with preservatives and pesticides, injections of highly toxic chemicals in the form of vaccines, and an incredible choice of toxic prescription drugs, all of which have serious side effects, and of course an increasing array of illegal drugs that are taken abusively. And this mentions nothing of the background pollution in both air and water. The environment, especially in cities, is quite abusive to our bodies.</p>
<p><b>To Minimize the Risk of Vaccine Damage</b></p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/vaccineexempt.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" class="noshadow" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-ndvYUapEn5A/TpHdZPRyqyI/AAAAAAAALS0/rUkfbJmy3o0/s240/vaccinexempt2.jpg" style="border: none"></a>The first consideration is to not vaccinate at all. If you do decide to vaccinate your children (possibly because you have no choice), consider delaying it until your children are two years old or for as long as possible. Breastfeeding your children will make them stronger because infant formulas cannot compete with the nutritional profile of mother’s milk. If you do decide to vaccinate never do so when your child is sick. Make sure the shots do not have thimerosal (mercury) as a preservative. Space out the jabs and avoid multiple combinations. Also, give your child vitamin C supplements before and after the vaccines: 1000 mg four times a day. Immediately after injection (or as soon as you can), put an icepack on the site of the injection to block the immune reaction and continue this at home.</p>
<p>We certainly do not want to vaccinate when someone is suffering from heavy chemical exposures. When numerous metals are present in the body, they have a “synergistic toxicity.” Dr. Boyd Haley, professor and chair of the chemistry department at the University of Kentucky, performed a study on rats and found that the mortality rate of rats exposed to a small dose of mercury or aluminum killed only one rat in 100. However, when the rats were exposed to both mercury and aluminum at the same time, all 100 rats died – a 100% mortality rate.[4],[5]</p>

<p><a href="http://www.whale.to/a/kalokerinos_sbs.html">Dr. Archie Kalokerinos</a> says, “There is no doubt in my mind (and this is based on long experience) that despite advice to the contrary it is not wise to administer vaccines to sick infants – including infants with ‘colds’. This is because, with infections (including ‘colds’), endotoxin is likely to be produced in the gut in excessive amounts, and liver detoxification processes are likely to be stressed. At first it was just a simple clinical observation. I observed that many infants, after they received routine vaccines like tetanus, diptheria, polio, whooping cough or whatever, became ill.</p>
<p>Some became extremely ill, and in fact some died. A third observation was that with some of these reactions that normally resulted in death, I found that I could reverse them by giving large amounts of vitamin C intramuscularly or intravenously. One would have expected, of course, that the authorities would take an interest in these observations that resulted in a dramatic drop in the death rate of infants in the area under my control, a very dramatic drop. But instead of taking an interest, their reaction was one of extreme hostility.”</p>
<p>The most important factor that affects zeta potential is pH.</p>

<p>
<b>Sodium Bicarbonate (Baking Soda)</b></p>
<p>The lead medicinal in our protocol to mitigate vaccine damages, besides vitamin C, is sodium bicarbonate. It is an emergency room and intensive care medicine that can be used by anyone easily and cheaply by applying topically or orally. Though bicarbonate is not often indicated for children, in the special case of facing the onslaught of vaccines, (and in the case of airborne oil toxicity), baking soda becomes our best friend for it will help regulate blood pH and thus blood zeta potential, which is a measure of the health of the blood.</p>
<p>Oncologists know enough to give sodium bicarbonate when they give their patients chemotherapy because they know it has the effect of buffering the poisons. Baking soda will make toxic poisons less poisonous meaning they will do less harm to the body. Read my <a href="http://sodiumbicarbonate.imva.info/">site</a> and book <a href="http://publications.imva.info/index.php/e-books/sodium-bicarbonate-rich-man-s-poor-man-s-cancer-treatment-e-book.html">Sodium Bicarbonate</a> for much more information on one of the safest and most effective allopathic nutritional medicines.</p>
<p><b>Water Hydration</b></p>
<p>The second most important factor is hydration.</p>
<p>The blood is 80% water, thus hydration levels are extremely important in blood chemistry. Moderate dehydration, a 3-5% decrease in body weight due to fluid loss, is sufficient to result in a substantial decrease in strength and endurance because of the decrease in oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood signaling a drop in zeta potential. Pediatricians are sued for neglecting hydration issues more frequently than anything else because water is that crucial for eliminating toxic buildups in the body. Pure water is a medicine but doctors don’t want anyone to see that and this gets them in a whole lot of trouble.<br />
Magnesium</p>
<p>There is nothing like <a href="http://www.magnesiumforlife.com/">magnesium</a> to alleviate cellular stress and to keep things working in harmony even when chemical insults threaten, as they do when foreign chemicals are injected directly into the blood. Magnesium should also be taken before, during and after surgery for the same reasons. It stiffens up our defenses against stress of any type including emotional and mental duress. All physiological processes are compromised with nutritional deficiencies and the majority of children and adults are severely deficient in magnesium. Neurological decline comes with deficiencies in magnesium and iodine, and injected toxic threats become more dangerous when these basic minerals (including selenium which is important to neutralize mercury) are in short supply.</p>
<p><b>Super Nutrition</b></p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/superfoods.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-oBYhzykle4E/UF4PWSOj_EI/AAAAAAAARz8/IxYhUqLJB9M/s220/200.jpg"></a>The best way to deal with vaccines and any other challenge to the body is to ensure that the body has everything it needs nutritionally. These needs are very broad and include 13 vitamins, more than 20 minerals, 2 essential fatty acids, 9 essential amino acids, a source of calories (includes protein, carbohydrates, and fats), a source of nucleic acids (especially RNA), water, oxygen, and sunlight. In addition, the body’s ability to detoxify unwanted substances by a variety of means, maintain proper acid/alkaline balance, produce optimal amounts of cellular energy (as ATP), and maintain a highly functional immune system are all crucial factors in remaining healthy after vaccine treatment.</p>
<p>There are a number of foods that help our bodies tolerate the effects of pollution and toxic poisoning. Eating lower on the food chain minimizes our chemical intake in general. Potent therapeutic foods offer a rich nutrient profile that deeply nourish our body and strengthens the immune system while supporting cardiovascular function, improving gastrointestinal and digestive health and enhancing natural cleansing and detoxification.</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>The secret is in getting your body so chemically unloaded and nutrient primed, that it heals itself. – Dr. Sherry Rogers</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We need foods that are not declining in nutritional value. Foods low on the food chain fight the malnutrition that is gaining strength in the general population. Such foods stimulate important parts of the immune system – bone marrow stem cells, macrophages, T-cells and natural killer cells, spleen and thymus glands; all would have to show enhanced activity. Importantly these foods high in chlorophyll and magnesium have the ability to generate new blood cells as well as directly increase oxygen-carrying capacity.</p>
<p>There are a number of foods in this category with <a href="http://www.lamolina.net/spirulina.html">spirulina</a> and chlorella sitting front and center on the list. Wheat, barley and alfalfa sprouts and juices also ring strong bells in this area of nutrient sources that will help us survive in the terrible age of toxicity that we are now in. Chemical injections (vaccines) only make matters worse so we need these foods in our diet no matter what.</p>
<p>The European Space Agency has chosen spirulina as one of the basic foods to be used on long space flights. I suggest to people that they take spirulina in the form of a product called <a href="http://blog.imva.info/?p=696">Rejuvenate</a> because it tastes so good, is easy to give children, and contains a whole lineup of superfoods combined magnificently.[6] Wheat and barley juices made naturally at home are wonderful and less expensive in this regard though tastes are not palatable for people and children who are not acclimated to these natural juices.</p>
<p>The Rejuvenate formulas that I recommend are based upon the research of Dr. Benjamin S. Frank who showed in extensive clinical trials and research studies that nucleic acids[7] are essential nutrients with benefits in terms of increased growth (especially muscle growth), greater endurance, positive effects on the cardiovascular system, greater lung capacity and easier breathing (i.e., better oxygen utilization) and even greater resistance to viruses.</p>
<p>Dr. Frank found that nucleic acids boost energy levels by significantly increasing production of the “high-energy” molecule ATP (adenosine triphosphate). The body requires the energy from ATP for many purposes, including cellular and tissue repair, metabolism, digestion, building a strong immune system, detoxification, and many other processes.</p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>Dr. Russell Blaylock has some very interesting things to say about avoiding vaccine damages. “Omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil supplements are potent immune suppressants. If you take high-dose EPA you will be more susceptible to infections since EPA is a powerful immune suppressant. However, in the case of an immune adjuvant reaction, you want to reduce it. Studies show that if you take EPA oil one hour before injecting a very powerful adjuvant called lipopolysaccharide (LPS), it would completely block the ability of the LPS to cause brain inflammation. Take a moderate dose of EPA every day, and more if needed, to tame a cytokine storm.”</p>
<p>Dr. Blaylock is very much aware of how a heightened nutritional profile helps reduce inflammatory cytokines. Flavonoids, vitamins E, D and C, zinc, magnesium, selenium and a multi-vitamin can help mitigate vaccine reactions and damage. He also recommends parsley and celery in a blender and drink eight ounces of this mixture twice a day. Dr. Blaylock says parsley is very high in a flavonoid called apigenin and celery is high in <a href="http://www.dietaryfiberfood.com/antioxidants/flavonoid-antioxidant.php">luteolin.</a> Giving Rejuvenate to children provides everything in a concentrated form simplifying the treatment.</p>

<p>One has to know the nature of the threat to take evasive actions.</p>
<p><a href="http://uncensored.co.nz/2009/02/19/the-science-of-vaccine-damage/">Veterinarian vaccines studies</a> are extremely useful in helping us see how dangerous vaccines can be. Dr. Larry Glickman, who spearheaded the Purdue research into post-vaccination biochemical changes in dogs, wrote “Our ongoing studies of dogs show that following routine vaccination, there is a significant rise in the level of antibodies [8] dogs produce against their own tissues. Some of these antibodies have been shown to target the thyroid gland, connective tissue such as that found in the valves of the heart, red blood cells, DNA, etc.”</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/superfoods.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" class="noshadow" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-N2GOFRKd8Vs/UF4PWWZ5dsI/AAAAAAAARz4/tuwcrewmlWA/s316/herbalcures.png" style="background: none;border: none" width="160"></a>There are plenty of reasons to become familiar with the protocol discussed here. It is the same basic protocol I will be suggesting (with some important additions like activated charcoal) to be used in case of airborne oil toxicity.</p>
<p>For the peoples of the third world (whose populations are increasingly being supplemented with the growing poor of the first world) who cannot afford superfoods, realize that by simply eating locally grown organic foods that have not been processed are huge steps in the right direction.</p>
<p>The masses who are eating white rice, for instance, are much more deficient in magnesium than those eating whole rice. Eating fruits, nuts and beans with organic whole grain rice instead of our modern diet of processed foods is going to protect us all, including our children.</p>

[1] The routine administration of Vitamin K to ‘all’ infants is not near as safe as medical authorities assure us though it cannot compare with the damage the hepatitis B vaccine is known to cause. Roche’s vitamin K product KONAKION contains ingredients such as phenol (carbolic acid — a poisonous substance distilled from coal tar), propylene glycol (derived from petroleum and used as an antifreeze and in hydraulic brake fluid) and acetic acid (an astringent antimicrobial agent that may drastically reduce the amount of natural vitamin K that would have otherwise been produced in the digestive tract). The study was a case-control study of 195 children with cancer born at either of two hospitals in Bristol, England, compared with 588 healthy children also born at these hospitals. One hospital predominantly gave vitamin K orally and the other intramuscularly. The authors found a nearly two-fold risk of leukemia in children who had received intramuscular vitamin K. These findings were extremely worrying. Golding calculated that the extra cases of leukemia caused by vitamin K injection could be as many as 980 in the UK alone. These results were supported by reports of the potential carcinogenicity of vitamin K from Israels et al, who suggested that low vitamin K levels in the newborn protect against the risk of mutations during a period of rapid cell growth and division. Compared to the hepatitis B the vitamin K shot is quite harmless, but it’s really just a matter of relativity. One attacks with phenol and propylene glycol and the other with recombined genetic material, aluminum, sodium chloride, disodium phosphate dehydrate, and sodium dihydrogen phosphate dihydrate.</p>

<p>[4] “We have demonstrated the toxicity of thimerosal by using it to kill neurons in culture. At 50 nanomolar thimerosal the neuron killing capacity/rate is about doubled with the addition of levels of aluminium found in vaccines. The aluminium alone at this level is not demonstrated to be toxic, so it is enhancing the toxicity of the thimerosal. It likely does this by increasing the rate that thimerosal breaks down releasing ethylmercury which is the toxic material” ——-Testimony Prof Boyd Haley, University of Kentucky, Chair and Head of Chemistry;</p>

<p>[6] Other superfoods and nutrients have been added to the formulas so that the body would have the needed supporting nutrients. For example, d-Ribose has been added so that this key sugar can be used to manufacture greater levels of RNA/DNA and ATP. Essential fats from either sprouted flax or chia seeds are included to optimize cell membrane function. Rice bran solubles are added to give a broad range of antioxidants. The Rejuvenate Plus formula has a complete coenzyme based multivitamin, high polyphenol and enzyme containing extract of vegetable sprouts, vegetable sources of proteins (rice, hemp, sprouts), lecithin for enhanced cell membrane and liver function, enzymes to enhance digestion of the nutrients, aloe vera for enhanced immunity and gut function, minerals from sea vegetables, taste enhancers that function as prebiotics, and herbs such as alfalfa grass and beet root juice powder, and ginger.</p>
<p>[7] Natural RNA sources included in the Rejuvenate formulas include chlorella, nutritional yeast, spirulina, chlorella growth factor, and yeast extracts of RNA. Besides being excellent sources of RNA these ingredients have many other desirable properties such as the ability to 1) Detoxify chemicals and heavy metals, 2) Destroy unwanted microbes, and 3) Enhance gut and immune system function.</p>
<p>[8] Auto-antibodies develop against many of internal biochemicals including</p>
<ul>
<li>fibronectin, laminin, DNA, albumin, cytochrome C, cardiolipin and collagen. What this means and what has specifically been seen is that vaccinated dogs – “but not the non-vaccinated dogs”– were attacking their own fibronectin, which is involved in tissue repair, cell multiplication and growth, and differentiation between tissues and organs in a living organism. The vaccinated dogs also developed autoantibodies to laminin, which is involved in many cellular activities including the adhesion, spreading, differentiation, proliferation and movement of cells.</li>

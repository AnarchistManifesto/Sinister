<p><strong>(<a href="https://www.mintpressnews.com/the-christchurch-shooting-and-the-normalization-of-anti-muslim-terrorism/256295/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MPN</a>)</strong> — <span style="font-weight: 400">What is without question the worst mass shooting in New Zealand’s history took place on Friday when shooters, 28-year-old Australian Brenton Tarrant among them, opened fire at two Christchurch mosques. Four, including Tarrant, have been arrested for the heinous act, which claimed at least 49 innocent lives. Tarrant was responsible for killing more than 40 victims, among them several children, in a rampage he live-streamed on Facebook, sending chills throughout the Muslim community, particularly Muslims living in Western countries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tarrant’s motives and ideology, laid bare in a </span><a href="https://www.mediafire.com/file/u153u4aqviafb3y/The+Great+Replacement.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400">74-page manifesto</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, show a concern over the fertility rates of non-white groups as well as the immigration of non-whites to countries like New Zealand and Australia, which he likened to an “invasion” that threatened the white majority in those countries. However, Tarrant — in his ignorance — failed to grasp that many of the Muslim immigrants he targeted had come to New Zealand after fleeing Western-backed invasions, occupations, or persecution in their home countries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Notable among Tarrant’s views is the fact that he is a clear ethno-nationalist, promoting his view that different ethnic groups must be kept “separate, unique, undiluted in [sic] unrestrained in cultural or ethnic expression and autonomy.” Tarrant also claimed that he doesn’t necessarily hate Muslims and only targeted those Muslims {i.e., immigrants) that chose “to invade our lands, live on our soil and replace our people.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He also stated that he chose to target Muslims because “Islamic nations, in particular, have high birth rates, regardless of race or ethnicity” and to satiate “a want for revenge against Islam for the 1,300 years of war and devastation that it has brought upon the people of the West and other peoples of the world.” His views are remarkably similar to those of Norwegian terrorist Anders Breivik, which is unsurprising given that Tarrant named him as an inspiration for the shooting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Though many — in the hours after the shooting — have sought to place blame and point fingers at notable demagogues like </span><a href="https://twitter.com/shaunking/status/1106401788050243584"><span style="font-weight: 400">President Donald Trump</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> or </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ISy8AUehgc"><span style="font-weight: 400">“counter-jihad” alt-right figures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> like Laura Loomer and Jacob Wohl, it is important to place Tarrant’s motivations in context.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Indeed, while Trump’s rise to political power has brought Islamophobic rhetoric into the public sphere in an undeniable way, it is a symptom of a much broader effort aimed at propagandizing the people of the United States and other Western countries to support wars in and military occupations of Muslim-majority countries. This manufactured Islamophobia, largely a product of Western governments and a compliant mass media, has sought to vilify all Muslims by maligning the religion itself as terrorism, in order to justify the plunder of their countries and deflect attention from their suffering. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is a classic “divide and conquer” scam aimed at keeping Westerners divided from Muslims in their own countries and abroad. The horrific shooting in Christchurch is a testament to its unfortunate success and pervasiveness, as well as a potent reminder that it must be stopped. Indeed, this manufactured Islamophobia has made it so that Muslims in their home countries are in danger of dying from Western-backed wars and, if they flee to the “safer” West, they have targets on their backs painted by the very war propaganda used to justify Western military adventurism in Muslim-majority nations. </span></p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<h5><strong>Islam, the media and “Forever Wars”: Who’s the “real” terrorist?</strong></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since September 11th and the advent of the “War on Terror,” mass media reporting increasingly began to conflate Muslims and Muslim-majority nations with war, terrorism and violence in general. Indeed, </span><a href="http://www.newseum.org/event/islamophobia-in-focus-muslims-and-the-media/"><span style="font-weight: 400">9 out of 10</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> mainstream news reports on Muslims, Islam, and Islamic organizations are related to violence and Muslims who are named on mainstream media are all-too-frequently warlords or terrorist leaders. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This near-constant association of Islam and violence has created the false perception that the religion of Islam, by its very nature, is violent and that Muslims too must then be violent and thus dangerous. This media-driven association has had very real and troubling consequences. For instance, </span><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jan/28/hate-crimes-muslims-media-politicians"><span style="font-weight: 400">a 2010 study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> by the University of Exeter found “empirical evidence to demonstrate that assailants of Muslims are invariably motivated by a negative view of Muslims they have acquired from either mainstream or extremist nationalist reports or commentaries in the media.” In other words, Islamophobic media reports are directly related to hate crimes targeting Muslims.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is no accident, as such biased reporting on Muslim-majority nations also began as Western-backed wars in countries like Iraq and Afghanistan sought to put these countries’ natural resources, namely their oil and mineral wealth, into the hands of American corporations. It should be no surprise then that top funders of media outlets that have routinely promoted Islamophobic narratives are also those who </span><a href="http://www.ijan.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IJAN-Business-of-Backlash-Executive-Summary-web1.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400">have profited</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> considerably from the “War on Terror” and Western-backed regime-change wars in other countries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This concerted effort to vilify Muslims has had the potent effect, likely by design, of reducing empathy among Westerners for the largely Muslim victims of Western military adventurism in Muslim-majority countries. Indeed, while mainstream news outlets often trumpet the imminent dangers Americans face from “radical Islamic terror,” the death toll of innocent people — most of them Muslim — that have been killed by the U.S.-led “War on Terror” is several orders of magnitude greater than the number of Americans who have died from all terror attacks over that same period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For instance, from 2001 to 2013, an estimated </span><a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2015/10/02/us/oregon-shooting-terrorism-gun-violence/"><span style="font-weight: 400">3,380 Americans died</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> from domestic and foreign terrorism, including the September 11 attacks as well as acts of domestic terrorism carried out by white nationalists and supremacists. If one excludes the September 11 death toll, the number of American deaths over that same period stands at around 400, </span><a href="https://sites.duke.edu/tcths/files/2019/01/2018_Kurzman_Muslim-American_Involvement_with_Violent_Extremism.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400">most</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> of them victims of mass-killers who were not Muslim.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By comparison, an estimated </span><a href="https://www.mintpressnews.com/war-media-propaganda-muslims-as-other-a-personal-narrative-of-islamophobia/210680/"><span style="font-weight: 400">8 million innocent people</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> in Muslim-majority nations died as a result of U.S. policies and wars in the Middle East and North Africa from 2001 to 2015. Yet, the magnitude of this loss of life of these “unworthy victims” is minimized by media and government silence, and the creation of a climate of Islamophobia in the West has only served to deepen the ease with which mass murder is accepted by the aggressor countries’ populations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Beyond the staggering disparity in the death tolls caused by terror groups and Western-backed imperialist wars is the fact that many of these very Western governments that purport to be so concerned with “radical Islamic terror” have often created and funded the most notorious terror groups of all. Indeed, the U.S. government helped to create Al Qaeda and </span><a href="https://www.mintpressnews.com/9-11-al-qaeda-syria-yemen/249127/"><span style="font-weight: 400">continues to protect</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> its Syrian branch — Hayat Tahrir al-Sham — in Syria’s Idlib province to this day. In addition, the CIA was just </span><a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-03-13/cia-conspiring-isis-turning-syrian-refugee-camps-isis-hotbeds"><span style="font-weight: 400">recently revealed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> to be helping the Islamic State regroup in Syrian refugee camps. Furthermore, the U.S. has long turned a blind eye to the </span><a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-real-largest-state-sponsor-of-terrorism_us_58cafc26e4b00705db4da8aa"><span style="font-weight: 400">funding of terror groups</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> by allied states like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The role of Western money, arms and policy in the creation and maintenance of radical Wahhabi terrorist groups is often entirely ignored by Western media portrayals of Muslim-majority nations, thereby creating a false image that such violence is endemic to these nations when, in fact, it is often imported state-sponsored terror.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">These nuances of the situation are rarely heard in the narratives parroted out on mainstream media and those who regularly consume mainstream news sources are more likely than not to support those narratives. For that reason, it is easy to see how someone like Donald Trump — who is said to watch television for </span><a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/364094-trump-watches-at-least-four-hours-of-tv-per-day-report"><span style="font-weight: 400">eight hours every day</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, much of it </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Fox News</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> — has espoused the views that he has. Thanks to the manufacturing of Islamophobia of mainstream media, racist policies like the so-called “Muslim ban” have found wide support, as this false narrative has conflated Islam with violence so often that many have come to believe that only by banning Islam can violence and terrorism in the U.S. be reduced. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, the recent shooting in Christchurch, as well as the Tree of Life Synagogue shooting and other recent acts of domestic terrorism, should alert us to the fact that it is the hate manufactured </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">by</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> this false narrative that is itself endangering American lives while also covering up the mass murder that has been perpetrated by the U.S. and other governments around the world for decades.</span></p>
<h5><strong>Israel’s leading role in stoking ethnonationalism</strong></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While the realities of post-9/11 America, as well as the rise in visibility of white ethnonationalism during the Trump Era, have done much to normalize attacks on immigrants, the country that has done the most to normalize anti-Muslim terrorism over this same time frame has been the state of Israel. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Israel, from its founding days, has long been steeped in neocolonialist ideology that is remarkably similar to the ideological basis behind other settler states like the United States, Australia and New Zealand. This system of beliefs holds that the native inhabitants of the land — whether the Palestinians, the Sioux or the Maori — are “primitive” and incompetent and that the land would have remained “wild” and undeveloped were it not for the “fortunate” appearance of European settlers. As </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">MintPress</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> noted in </span><a href="https://www.mintpressnews.com/israel-desert-bloom/244003/"><span style="font-weight: 400">a previous report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> on the subject, such narratives cast these settlers as both superior and normal while the natives become inferior and abnormal, thus obfuscating the settler’s status as foreigner and conqueror.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In Israel’s case, this ideology has promoted the idea that all Arabs are “sons of the desert” while the desert simultaneously represents a barbaric obstacle to “progress” and development. However, the state of Israel, under the lengthy tenure of current Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, has seen these long-standing and somewhat hidden underpinnings of the Zionist state burst out into the open. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The result has been the overt expression of ethnonationalism in such a way that Israel has become an inspiration to white nationalists in the United States, like Richard Spencer, and far-right ethno-fascist leaders like Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro and India’s Narendra Modi. The inspiration has been mutual, according to </span><a href="https://forward.com/news/breaking-news/366477/jewish-militants-seek-white-nationalist-alliance-but-draw-the-line-at-nazis/"><span style="font-weight: 400">reports and testimonials</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> published by Jewish newspaper </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">The Forward</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For years, through its military occupation of Palestine, Israel’s government and military have sought to paint all Palestinians, including children, as “terrorists” or “terrorist sympathizers.” Take, for example, current Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked, </span><a href="https://archive.is/zWrrG"><span style="font-weight: 400">who wrote </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">in 2014, “This is a war between two people. Who is the enemy? The Palestinian people …”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

</script></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A more recent example came from former Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman, who asserted </span><a href="https://www.mintpressnews.com/israeli-defense-minister-every-single-person-gaza-potential-target/240323/"><span style="font-weight: 400">just last year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> that “no innocent people” live in the Gaza Strip and that every inhabitant in the enclave is somehow connected to Hamas, even though nearly half of Gaza’s population are children and teenagers. Such rhetoric has become par for the course and numerous examples show that Shaked and Lieberman’s views are increasingly accepted and “normal” in today’s Israel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yet, the clearest indication of anti-Muslim terror’s normalization in Israel is the recent rise of Otzma Yehudit, or the “Jewish Power” Party. This party, founded by devotees of radical American-born Rabbi Meir Kahane, </span><a href="http://time.com/5536862/israel-netanyahu-jewish-power-criticism/"><span style="font-weight: 400">has now merged</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> — at Netanyahu’s urging — with the Jewish Home Party and stands to become part of Israel’s ruling coalition if Netanyahu manages to win in the country’s upcoming elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the office of Itamar Ben Gvir, one of Otzma Yehudit’s leaders, is </span><a href="https://mondoweiss.net/2019/02/gurvitz-netanyahu-supremacist/"><span style="font-weight: 400">a framed picture</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> of Baruch Goldstein. In an act that bears a striking similarity to the events in Christchurch, Goldstein — a long-time devotee of Kahane — entered a mosque in the West Bank city of Hebron in 1994 and opened fire, killing 29 and injuring more than 125 worshippers. After the act, Kahane’s Kach party — the predecessor of Otzma Yehudit — was labeled a terrorist organization by the United States and Israel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite official condemnation, Goldstein’s atrocious act has been the subject of praise and inspiration for subsequent extremists who, under Netanyahu’s government, have become increasingly normalized. Goldstein’s gravestone reads “He gave his life for the people of Israel, its Torah and land” and continues to be used as a site of pilgrimage and homage by the very extremists that Netanyahu is openly courting for political gain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While the followers of Kahane are making a comeback in Israel, several notable Arab political parties </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/israeli-electoral-committee-bans-arab-candidates-allows-extreme-right-to-run/2019/03/07/9ecd3dd4-40c4-11e9-9361-301ffb5bd5e6_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.965e104fd96e"><span style="font-weight: 400">have been banned</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> from participating Israel’s upcoming elections, with some being accused of “supporting terrorism” owing to their opposition to Israel’s decades-long military occupation of Palestine. Yet, by elevating clear terror supporters among the ranks of the Jewish Power Party, it has become increasingly clear that openly supporting and advocating anti-Muslim terrorism is no bar to legitimacy and political power in today’s Israel.</span></p>
<h5><strong>No ‘clash of civilizations,’ only manipulation and exploitation of differences</strong></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The tragic and barbaric shooting in Christchurch, New Zealand is yet another horrific and glaring reminder that the “divide and conquer” war propaganda that has sought to promote the so-called “clash of civilizations” between Christianity and Islam, West and East, has not only been monstrously effective but continues to be monstrously destructive to people on both sides. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, the media’s manufacture of Islamophobia, in seeking to Wite-out Muslim suffering and reduce Western empathy for innocent Muslim civilians, has increasingly placed targets on the back of Muslims everywhere — in the West and the East — making it increasingly difficult for practitioners of the Islamic faith to feel safe regardless of where they live. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With most Muslim-majority countries now killing fields in Western-backed wars, ruled by oppressive, Western-backed dictatorships, or under threat of Western-backed regime change, even those Muslims who have sought a safer, quieter life in the “civilized” West have now found themselves targets thanks to the very war propaganda used to justify the destruction of their home countries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While the murderer Tarrant had stated that he hoped his horrific crime would help stoke “civil war” in Western countries, this tragedy should and must serve as a wake up call for people everywhere that the real forces responsible for the destruction of many Muslim-majority countries and the current chaos present in many Western countries are not generated by civilian populations or religions but instead by the global oligarchy that engineers and profits from this chaos. These oligarchs loot from the people of the West just as they do from the people of the East and it is time to recognize that they are the real threats to a more peaceful world — not regular people praying, whether it be in a church, a synagogue or a mosque.</span></p>

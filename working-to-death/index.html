<a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2012/04/working-to-death.html"><b>Activist Post</b></a></p>
<p>Time to take on one of the ugliest questions an American worker can ask: “Do I have to work until death?”</p>
<p>Sadly, for an increasing number of Americans, the idea of retirement  at age 62 to a life rich with adventures and the once-held American  dream of “Golden Years” has turned into cardboard, or worse.</p>
<p>We’ve identified a large number of factors which are in play and a  discussion of each helps to put “Working to Death” into perspective.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mass consumption Home Improvement Loans and HELOCs.</li>
<li>The soaring divorce rates of recent years.</li>
<li>Inter-government “investment” of Social Security.</li>
<li>Long-term inflation by the Federal Reserve.</li>
<li>Soaring healthcare costs.</li>
<li>Serial market declines.</li>
<li>Pension fund bankruptcies and shortages.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s address these in turn, starting with home improvement loans and  HELOCs – the once darlings of the financial “services” industry  standing for Home Equity Lines of Credit.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>At their peak, during the  go-go years of the 1990s and into beginning of the end of the housing  bubble in 2007, the number of people “borrowing home equity” for current  expenses, such as education, a new SUV, or to meet unexpected cash flow  demands, skyrocketed.</p>
<div align="center">
</div>
<p>
<b>A Huge Problem with the Payback</b></p>
<p>The problem was that most people never really paid the money back, so when the housing collapse began in earnest in 2008 (and arguably  by the Case Shiller/S&amp;P Housing Index report, it continues even now  with housing prices stuck at 2003 levels) hundreds of thousands faced  bankruptcy.</p>
<p>If you thought the housing collapse was done, wake up and think again. The US Attorney Legal Services web site reports <a href="http://www.usattorneylegalservices.com/foreclosure-statistics.html" target="_blank">an estimated 4-million delinquent mortgages are heading into foreclosure this year</a>.</p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<ins class="adsbygoogle"
     style="display:block; text-align:center;"

     data-ad-slot="2109552235"></ins>
<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script></div>

<p>Another factor not often addressed is the impact of a raging  national divorce rate in the period. Depending on which source you want  to consider, the divorce rate in the US jumped by between 25 and 50%  between the 1950s and 1970s through 1980s levels.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/jurisdictionary.html" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-sVD2eCRdx2U/TfAdgvjs8iI/AAAAAAAAJRI/xjibjuwcdSg/Toolboxebook2.jpg"></a>Thanks to  court-sanctioned divorce settlements, many times a woman (especially in  the 1980s) would have to refinance a family home in order to “cash out”  the soon-to-be ex’s equity position.</p>
<p>This means some increased pressure in home lending at the time, but  in the follow-on period which we’re in now, plenty of single women from  their late 50s to low 70s find that because of financial emergencies,  low wages, and the pressures of parenting, they just haven’t been able  to get the home paid off.</p>
<p>With Social Security not keeping up with real  inflation, this means thousands of aging women will have to stay in the  workforce, or face the specter of losing their homes and having to move  into either a very small condo, or worse: lose a lifetime of working  for a paid-off home entirely by going into the rental market.</p>
<p><b>And Then There is Social Security</b></p>
<p>The government’s stewardship of Social Security funds is another area of concern. According to the Social Security web site:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Social Security Trust Funds are the <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/oact/ProgData/describeoasi.html" target="_blank">Old-Age and Survivors Insurance</a> (OASI) and the <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/oact/ProgData/describedi.html" target="_blank">Disability Insurance</a>  (DI) Trust Funds. These funds are accounts managed by the Department of  the Treasury. They serve two purposes: (1) they provide an accounting  mechanism for tracking all income to and disbursements from the trust  funds, and (2) they hold the accumulated assets. These accumulated  assets provide automatic spending authority to pay benefits. The Social  Security Act limits trust fund expenditures to benefits and  administrative costs. </p>
<p>Benefits to retired workers and their  families, and to families of deceased workers, are paid from the OASI  Trust Fund. Benefits to disabled workers and their families are paid  from the DI Trust Fund. More than 98 percent of total disbursements in  2011 were for benefit payments.</p>
<p>A Board of Trustees oversees the financial operations of the trust funds. The Board reports annually to the Congress on the <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/oact/TR/index.html" target="_blank">financial status of the trust funds</a>. </p>
<p>By law, income to the trust funds must  be invested, on a daily basis, in securities guaranteed as to both  principal and interest by the Federal government. All securities held by  the trust funds are “special issues” of the United States Treasury.  Such securities are available only to the trust funds.</p>
<p>In the past, the trust funds have held  marketable Treasury securities, which are available to the general  public. Unlike marketable securities, special issues can be redeemed at  any time at <i>face value</i>. Marketable securities are subject to  the forces of the open market and may suffer a loss, or enjoy a gain, if  sold before maturity. Investment in special issues gives the trust  funds the same flexibility as holding cash.</p>
<p>Data on <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/oact/ProgData/investheld.html" target="_blank">trust fund investments</a> provide a breakdown by interest rate and trust fund for any month after 1989.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Somewhere in here we could have a discussion about whether the  government is really making money, in inflation-corrected terms. It  would seem that the interest rate (1.85% in April of 2012) is much  better than what a large bank offers to its depositors. On the day we  checked, Bank of America was only paying 0.45% to its CD holders.</p>
<div style="float: right;margin-left: 1em;margin-bottom: 0em"><a href="http://activistpost.net/foodcrisis.html"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-gSYYiihhpjI/TtEcIO54fhI/AAAAAAAAM2s/G6yL-FN6K7A/s261/foodcrisis-160-2.gif" alt=""></a></div>
<p>What skews the whole equation, however, is monetary inflation  (printing more money) which is happening at a fairly good clip most of  the time and a fairly accurate reconstruction of the Federal Reserve’s  M3 rate (which the Fed ever-so-conveniently stopped reporting to the  public in the Alan Greenspan period) reveals that the Federal Reserve’s  broad measure <a href="http://www.nowandfutures.com/key_stats.html#m3b">has been going up in recent weeks at about 5.0%.</a></p>
<p>What most people don’t realize is that by having a high inflation  rate (the printing rate of the money) that’s going up faster than the  interest rate the government “charges itself” for interagency borrowing,  the real purchasing power of the Social Security funds is falling  behind the real rate of (money-printing) inflation.</p>
<p><b>Now, is that slick, or what?</b></p>
<p>Well, not if we’re ever expecting to get back a decent return on what  we all poured in to social security, but that’s another article.  Sorry  to mix both the short-term returns and the long-term federal  money-dilution scheme into a single ball of wax, but there you have it.</p>
<p>If you average out the first 99-years of the Federal Reserve, the  money printing has average 3.24 percent per year over the period. Few  bother to run out the numbers, but with the Fed M3 increasing at about  5% and Social Security interagency paper under earning less than 2%,  well let’s just say that Social Security Trust fund is not keeping even  on.  It may be doing better than most banks, but the money dilution  machine is still problematic.</p>
<p>Soaring healthcare costs is another concern, not so much because  Medicaid doesn’t work – it does – but it doesn’t cover everything , and  that’s yet another consideration going into retirement, especially if  there’s a history of chronic, long sunset diseases like Alzheimer’s or a  slow form of cancer in your genetic makeup.</p>
<p>We could delve into this more, but to some extent the future of  healthcare is in the hands of the US Supreme Court, so we’ll let this  one sit, but note in passing that it’s another problem people thinking  of retirement have to deal with.</p>
<p>For people who were doing well, the serial market declines, first in  the 2001-2003 period, and more recently from the 2008 through 2009  period had a huge impact.  A few people managed to also be led into the  financial slaughterhouse by being caught with over-levered real estate,  too, since that was one alternative some couples put money into thinking  it would “all work out.” It hasn’t and in our opinion, it won’t.</p>
<p><b>Bank Failures and More</b></p>
<p>We’ve all heard in the news about failures in the banking industry –  they’ve been pretty well plastered all over the press and at the <a href="http://www.fdic.gov/" target="_blank">www.fdic.gov </a>website.  But what we don’t hear hardly anything about is the goings on at the  Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the government backstop to pension  plans.</p>
<p>The agency issued a press release – way back in November of 2011 – which included this somber note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘<a href="http://www.pbgc.gov/news/press/releases/pr12-04.html" target="_blank">Most private pensions are sound</a>,’  said PBGC Director Joshua Gotbaum, ‘but some are real sources of  concern. We want to make sure they can restore themselves, and that PBGC  has the resources to help.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://www.pbgc.gov/documents/2010-Exposure.pdf" target="_blank">exposure report</a> provides  projections on the future status of private pension plans and their  effect on PBGC’s financial status. The projection, as of Sept. 30, 2010,  in PBGC’s single employer program was for a deficit of $24 billion in  2020, an increase from the program’s $21.6 billion deficit on that  date.  There is nothing good about that.</p>
<p><b>Concerns About Some Multiemployer Plans</b></p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>
<script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
<ins class="adsbygoogle"
     style="display:block; text-align:center;"
     data-ad-layout="in-article"
     data-ad-format="fluid"

<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script></div>

<p>For the multiemployer program, the deficit was projected in the same period to reach $9.4 billion up from $1.5 billion.</p>
<p>Projections in the report show a nearly 30 percent chance that PBGC’s  multiemployer program will run out of money entirely within 20 years.  As of FY 2010, the multiemployer program had $1.6 billion in assets to  cover $3.1 billion in existing liabilities.</p>
<p>Many multiemployer plans remain financially sound. Financial distress  in the multiemployer program stems from funding shortfalls of a few  large multiemployer plans.</p>
<div class="code-block code-block-1" style="margin: 0px">
<div align="center" class="mrf-external">
<a href="https://amorain.com/?E=ikLQsSIi%2fgaXBh0SRK5s8g%3d%3d&amp;s1="><img src="https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/500.jpg"></a></p>

</div>
<p>Unlike single-employer plans, PBGC does not acquire the assets of  multiemployer plans, but instead must wait until they are completely  insolvent before beginning to fund benefits. Computer simulations from  the agency’s Pension Insurance Modeling System project that the  multiemployer program has a 6 percent chance of becoming insolvent by  2020, and a nearly 30 percent chance of insolvency by 2030.</p>
<p><b>Single-Employer Program Projected Steady During Next Decade</b></p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/autopilot.html" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-BWwQvx0mWFc/Tx3M3fCrPNI/AAAAAAAAOJM/py5ko9h9TKs/s200/200x167.gif"></a>PBGC performed 5,000 simulations on the future of the single employer  program, which has $78 billion in assets to cover $99 billion in  pension benefits. The average projection showed an increase in future  program deficits to $24 billion. None of the computer simulations  projected the program to run out of money in the next 10 years.</p>
<p>Sounds hopeful, but remember that many of the pension projections are  based on government outlooks for the economy, which we have to red flag  since they haven’t been horribly accurate lately, it seems.</p>
<p><b>So what does it all come down to?</b></p>
<p>In general, we could argue a number of factors are in play, but the  most interesting one to us (since the two G’s live well under our  incomes and live a more sedate ‘strategic’ lifestyle than peers) is that  most people blow retirement by not keeping their lifestyle under  control.</p>
<p>A 2010 paper by the Census Bureau (“<a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/wealth/Final%20Draft_Paper_Revised4_5_2011.pdf" target="_blank">Can Americans Afford to Retire?</a>”) sums up the paradox this way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This seemingly paradoxical result can be explained by  the fact maintaining pre-retirement standard of living might be more  difficult for higher income groups. In addition, the top third includes  people with median earnings of $100,000, which means that the households  that fall into the top third category are not necessarily well-off  (Munnell, et. Al., 2006). </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>More importantly, we believe this result could very well be due to  omission of housing from our calculation of wealth. Likewise, we believe  that once we take housing into account in our calculations of  replacement rates, this result will be drastically different.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or, it may not.  The reason being that much of the paper wealth of  once upper-income people has evaporated at a pretty good clip due to the  declines in real estate which, though we keep hearing promises of green  shoots and good times ahead, have been largely a mirage so far.</p>
<p>That Census paper is a lot more optimistic than we are. An increasing  number of Americans are growing skeptical, with one post noticing that  “Company(s) illegally underfunds their Pension Fund…Keeps the money…Claims bankruptcy…Government picks up the pension obligation…Company  reorganizes…cuts wages…Public pays for it all.”</p>
<p><b>Summing It All Up</b></p>
<p>So no matter how much we made – and thought we had saved – until the  house is paid off and a “car for life” is paid, too . . .  and there’s  dough in the bank for taxes and excess medical not covered by Medicare .  . . an increasing number of “over 60s” are getting a wee bit cranky  about being worked to death.</p>
<p>Now lucky for us – the Two Gs – we have met the requirement to have  paid-up homes and a couple of paid-up cars for life.  Still, we both put  in work weeks of 40 hours or more.  So yes, to us, retirement is just a  myth.  And yes again, working to death is the new reality.</p>

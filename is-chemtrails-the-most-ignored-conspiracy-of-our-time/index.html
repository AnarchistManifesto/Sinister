<p>As the days go by and become weeks, months and even years, a large segment of humanity struggles with the reality of an ugly distant truth we must all reconcile, one that we are forced to behold sometimes on a daily basis. Yes, we are forced to look at the evidence of the chemical trails in our local skies but not everyone reconciles the visual evidence for what it is. In fact, many of us deliberately and carefully avoid applying critical thought into the implications and ramifications of what could be.</p>
<p>Too many of us put effort into avoiding, ignoring, or disbelieving the idea that government or any group of influential people would carry on with this agenda in a business as usual manner—while simultaneously and purposely exposing humanity to known toxic chemicals in the name of advancing an agenda for control of nature and humanity. Regardless of what side of the phenomenon you are on, you nonetheless are subjected to having to look up to the sky and see the trails of white for yourself.</p>
<p>Everyone can see the evidence of the chemical lines being produced by actual planes in real time, an observation not hidden from anyone right? Or is it? Can everyone actually see the white trails of chemicals being artificially emitted into our skies?</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>Can those who are asleep, in denial, or unaware of the spraying programs actually see the white trails in the sky? Given that we know from psychology experiments that humans are designed to only see what they are comfortable seeing depending on the circumstances. The 1953 <a href="http://truthandarttv.com/watch_91204">Asch Conformity Experiment</a> proved just that. Humans may or may not see something that is there depending on whether seeing it will generate social anxiety or not. Perhaps many don’t see the physical trails in the sky for similar reasons. That is, their senses do not pick up on the white lines because seeing them sets off a cascade of inconvenient thoughts and emotions they would rather not have to deal with. Something as inconvenient as aerial chemical spraying can be easily packaged away and subconsciously brushed off.</p>

<p>
For others it’s as simple as missing something you are not looking for while your mind is heavily preoccupied with other things. This temporary blinding effect is something I can attest to in my own experience. Before someone pointed out chemtrails to me I had admittedly never noticed any trails in the sky. Was this out-of-sight out-of-mind phenomenon something that might explain why the chemtrails movement is so ignored? Can this account for why exposing chemtrails spraying has proven particularly resistant to humanity as a whole? Is there something in our nature that refuses to cross the boundaries of earth-related crimes or that imposes a cut-off point with respect to magnitude of perceived evil? Has the control system simply succeeded more at reaching for the greater levels of non-believability with the chemical spraying operations? Or is it something else?</p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>Perhaps the magnitude of corruption and secrecy amongst those involved in these geoengineering crimes really does go far above what our minds can understand. Or do we have it all backwards? Is it that since the chemtrails issue is so easily observable and at the same time scary and unbelievable, is it possible the human brain perceives it as the most ignored issue, when in fact it is not? Would humanity perceive it as horribly ignored because of the feeling of helplessness that comes with the issue? Is this an issue explained by the human brain and behavior?</p>
<p><b>Resistance, opposition and attacks</b></p>
<p>A movement without a clear voice of leadership and without a voice is perceived to lack organization. At some levels we have observed leaders in the movement endure character assassination in an attempt to diminish the credibility of those who have risked it all to expose this (geoengineering) issue. Others have been downright ignored and trivialized by the mainstream media and politicians. But is the chemtrails/geoengineering movement any more subjected to resistance, opposition and attacks any more than other anti-new world order movement? What about the mysterious role the chemtrails spraying has played with the side-by-side environmental movement? Is there an argument to be made for why the global warming/environmental globalist movements might be the strongest resistors and direct oppositions to the truth about chemtrails spraying?</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/teslasecret/" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" class="noshadow" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/_qLAIskTQXUc/TaqAcrCPlhI/AAAAAAAAISQ/5uq527jnmDM/book-shape.jpg" style="border: none"></a>I want to suggest that the environmental movement may still be alive today despite the often <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOyBfihjQvI">debunked global warming claims</a> because the globalists need the movement to use as a tool or umbrella under which they are to later <a href="http://chemtrailsplanet.net/2013/10/20/scientists-push-for-aerosol-geoengineering-to-fix-global-warming/">hide the chemtrails movement</a>. What if this was the primary purpose of the environmental movement to begin with? What if this explains why the chemtrails movement needs to be ignored by the mass media and politicians at all cost until the time is right? In this scenario, I propose that the environmental movement may be the strongest resistor and attacker of the chemtrails movement by the act of ignoring it. Yes, every time an “environmental” activist ignores geoengineering and the blatantly obvious chemical spraying, that so-called “activist” is actually attacking the chemtrails movement with the label of illegitimacy. It’s the equivalent effect of a doctor being asked about diabetes, who then responds by ignoring the importance of the question, claiming diabetes is not a real problem and then quickly moving on to another subject. By doing that, the doctor is endorsing the idea that diabetes is a non-problem and thought should not be put into it. To those who do suffer from diabetes this would be seen as an insensitive and aggressively ignorant attack on those who suffer from this disorder. Likewise perhaps the global warming/environmental movement and all of its shills, trolls, minions, and mouthpieces accounts for why the chemtrails spraying movement is so ignored.<br />
Money and ethics</p>
<p>Can it be that the geoengineering and the chemtrails spraying proclaimed by government environmental criminal David Keith to be so “cheap” to implement, represent an extraordinary money and profit making opportunity for some that the profits are being used to silence all the players? Is this a special money maker far above any other conspiracy operation against humanity? What about the admitted <a href="http://www.whyintheworldaretheyspraying.com/">weather derivatives</a> being bargained for and the tampering with the weather that is now admitted by sources involved in these activities? Is this a glimpse of the greater picture of what is really happening on a global geoengineering/financial scale? If so, would this explain why chemtrails spraying operations seems to be the most ignored conspiracy ever?</p>
<p><b>Failure of basic science and reason</b></p>
<p>Is this really a scientific question? Should we be considering that “chemtrails” a phrased coined in a U.S. Air Force chemistry 131 “CHEMTRAILS”<a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/133469311/Chemtrails-Chemistry-Manual-United-States-Air-Force-Academy-1990"> training manual</a> back in 1990 is after all a science and chemistry issue that is difficult for many to understand given their lack of chemistry background? Given that so many Americans are ‘science’ challenged, can it be that this is the primary reason why so many people tune out the issue? Can it be that science and perceived scientific details are items that the average TV watching, videogame playing American zombie has no time for? Perhaps this scientific challenge is one of the reasons Americans choose to default any form of critical thinking to the perceived “experts” who just all happen to work for government and government interest related organizations.</p>
<p>Yes, we’re talking about government taking over the science which was admitted by Obama himself during his 2008 campaigning. We know they did a valiant but unsuccessful attempt to steal the science with NIST 9/11 computer models that side stepped ancient laws of physics and attempted to show the world all the cartoon hypothetical scenarios that lead to 3 giant buildings literally dancing and falling through themselves symmetrically and at freefall speed due to hydrocarbon burning office fires, for reasons paralleling storylines from Bugs Bunny or Coyote versus Roadrunner cartoons. Unfortunately to those who still believe the 9/11 official story these silly cartoons ARE the scientific reality they pin their entire beliefs on.</p>
<p>Okay, so we knew they were capable of working this kind of magic to induce cognitive dissonance at a mass scale. I suppose the lesson to learn here is do not take science lessons from government. Meanwhile, it gets worse; in my study of the chemtrails spraying I discovered years ago after writing directly to my senator about the aerosol spraying programs, that even senators are prepared to quote government science as a primary tool to deflect issues like this. At the time my state senator actually explained to me in a letter that I should be aware of government studies that were conducted around 2000 to understand what those white lines being created by planes were all about. According to one of my senators, we should not be alarmed because these government <a href="http://www-pm.larc.nasa.gov/sass/pub/journals/Minnis.etal.JClim.03.pdf">studies</a> prove that chemtrails are really normal contrails which happen to form at specific combinations of temperature and humidity.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/backyardliberty.html" rel="nofollow" style="float: right;margin-left: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ONE8Lk_RzR8/UjeZnRyZRTI/AAAAAAAAVJw/TMNS4NzHKZo/s220/BL_158220.gif" alt=""></a>That was years ago, of course I was never given any explanation from government as to where the actual experiments were that actually proved these claims or for that matter what specifically compelled government (NASA, USAF) to conduct such a (secret) study given that the same U.S. Air Force mentioned in one of the studies is the very same entity who coined the phrase chemtrails almost ten years prior. Also I wasn’t offered an explanation as to why would government consider this kind of funding money well spent given the known circumstances. The expectation then, as it is now, was that I (we) should accept this (exclusive) science lesson from our government, we should stop asking questions, and accepted their claims as truth like we should with their global warming claims. There was no room in this conversation for critical thinking or elaboration of the facts and details.</p>
<p>Government has that quality about it — it expects you to simply shut up and obey; and, above all, never ask questions or expect follow through of basic scientific rules (like say the scientific method). Letters from politicians touching on any level of science are indeed classic communications worth considering as historical documents. The chemtrails issue may mark the threshold between—‘that was scientifically sound, understandable, and easy’ and – ‘that was too much for me, I’ll let government experts figure it out’. Perhaps humans are simply overwhelmed by the concepts needed to grasp here, that being primarily concepts of temperature, pressure, gas and liquid formation, and humidity. Sounds complicated?</p>
<p>But wait, surely some level of science is absorbable by the average science novice. You don’t need to have a chemistry background to know that ice will not form in the warm weather right? Is our common knowledge of planes and jet fuel burning on a hot dry summer day in southern California that disconnected and beyond basic critical thinking that we can’t reason at any level why a persistent cold-humid-weather condensation trail can’t be spontaneously emitted from an unmarked jet with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yYaqGkBcoQ&amp;feature=share">non-transponder signals</a> which loop around the sky and incidentally leave trails of white clouds that spread and cover our skies white when teams of planes spray together at the same time? Really? Being able to distort even this basic level of common sense seems to have been part of the plan. Though the argument seems to have died out a little in the last few years it is still not uncommon to hear regular assaults on common sense in media and radio when government trolls exclusively defend these government spraying programs, still hanging on to the ‘contrails’ myth with a straight face.</p>
<p>I often warn activists, beware of the chemtrails/geoengineering movement, it comes with a disturbing level of psychological discomfort and it can subsequently weigh heavier on your being and psyche. I’m not sure entirely why this is, but some of the above reasons are included though the reasons may not be limited to these only.</p>

<p>Perhaps chemtrails is the most ignored government conspiracy crime of all time because it represents government and private corporations <a href="http://truthandarttv.com/watch_710028">playing god</a> with no rules and restrictions. Perhaps this is truly part of the mother of all conspiracies which I believe is control of the planet. Perhaps because it’s all tied and intertwined with the universal global warming lie and the subsequent climate change religion that the globalists need to continue pushing to usher in their all-important global carbon tax and global control grid to control all human activity in the name of the environment. Perhaps it’s time to connect the dots between “sustainable” cities, Agenda 21, depopulation, and the new world order end game of mass global control of humanity. Now that the government geoengineers are admitting that chemtrails spraying is real but that it is intended as a solution for global warming (which we knew all along was a lie), now we see the globalist connecting the dots for us. They seem poised to bring chemtrails into the spotlight when the time is right.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/backyardliberty.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-S6RfjP7Lvo8/USlEmRqWjJI/AAAAAAAAUgk/Zio_5z2T_gE/s200/prep.gif" alt=""></a>I say let’s implement solutions starting with each and every one of us. Let’s continue exposing the chemtrails operations and device new ways of exposing those involved. Let’s become familiar with the difference between experiments, (that is proof of reproducible peer review experiments) and government “abstracts” which are summary claims of what a study shows so that we can explain these differences to others. They are not the actual study or the actual experiments. Let us continue exposing the planes and the pilots that spray our skies, reminding the general public that environmental terrorism is terrorism nonetheless. Notice how the spraying planes work together, and share this information with others.</p>
<p>They begin spraying at a certain time of the day or night and they begin together, this is easily observable by anyone regardless of any government abstract which suggests patterns inconsistent with simple observation. Read the government abstract for yourself and see if you can personally debunk every single claim in it. You may find this easier than you think. Take note that they also will spray at ALL temperatures and humidity levels not within a predictable range of temperatures and humidity levels as science, reason and common sense would predict. This alone debunks all claims made by the fraudulent ‘contrails’ movement. The planes that spray essentially never are traceable on flight tracking data sites—that is, they are invisible to other planes apparently without transponders on. Learn to <a href="http://flightaware.com/">track this data</a> on your own and convince yourself of this by refering to a site that provides this data.</p>
<p>Notice that their efforts are extremely coordinated, you may notice the planes turn around in mid-air and fly over the same paths to spray their chemical load in the sky. Also look for mid-flight turning on and off of the spray. I have seen this many times and many others have captured this on video. All of these signs and signals of chemtrails planes can be appreciated by anyone looking for them.</p>
<p>Focus your attention on the entire environmental movement and be prepared to challenge every single environmental claim from this point on. The Obama administration recently passed an <a href="http://truthandarttv.com/watch_91221">executive order</a> to take over climate change legislation only a few weeks after the IPCC admitted that the planet has not warmed since 1998. Shortly after this, SHOWTIME (recently and shockingly) put out a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeO68-e-Glg">trailer</a> for a new upcoming pro-global warming/climate change TV show. If this is not a desperate attempt to keep the global warming lies and the subsequent climate religion alive I don’t know what is. By staying focused on all of these environmental issues and continuing to pressure the so-called “environmental” activists to do something about chemtrails and geoengineering we will hopefully erode their façade of lies which is hiding behind the ignorance.</p>
<p>This year the <a href="http://nypost.com/2013/12/05/global-warming-proof-is-evaporating/">global warming</a> movement may have sustained their final blow with the truth about global temperatures now common knowledge; but that doesn’t mean they will not keep coming at humanity with more and more lies. Once we remove the ignorance, I believe the truth will be clear to many. But let’s not assume that this is the sure solution or that the solution will come on its own. Let’s support each other, support leaders in the movement, let’s fund the next film that will expose this issue at a large scale. Getting the word out to the common person in a harmoneous manner is important.</p>
<p>There are many environmental activists that can make a big difference if they really understood the importance of this issue. Let’s try to win them over by pointing out the truth about the global cooling that we are in, and the risk we are all taking in assuming that we are not entering an ice age that could cost most of our lives. We must take a stand against government claims of global warming that aim to directly deceive without any proof. We are already in this process as scientists, educators and leaders are taking a stand against this entire environmental agenda which ignores global cooling and geoengineering while focusing on man-made CO2 producing humans as the problem accounting for the non-existing (in a “PAUSE”) global warming. May humanity catch on soon enough to turn this thing around before we enter what some are already saying could be an irreversible coming ice age. Perhaps the chemtrails movement really is the most ignored conspiracy of all time. But with global temperatures dropping with every year we may be looking at a ‘wake-up-by-default’ scenario as the perils of another ice age dawns upon us.</p>

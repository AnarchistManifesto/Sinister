<a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2014/03/10-health-conspiracy-theories-that.html"><b>Activist Post</b></a></p>
<p>Do you believe in any “health conspiracy theories”?  Do you believe  that there are “natural cures” for diseases that the medical  establishment is not telling you about?  Do you believe that vaccines,  cell phones or the fluoride in the water can have a harmful impact on  the health of your family?</p>
<p>If you answered yes to any of those  questions, you are not alone.  According to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/18/us-medical-conspiracies-idUSBREA2H22K20140318?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=healthNews" target="_blank" title="one recent survey">one recent survey</a>,  approximately half of all Americans believe in at least one “medical  conspiracy theory”.  Thanks to the Internet, more people than ever are  questioning the established dogma of the medical community.  As a  result, more people are starting to make their own health decisions, and  this has resulted in quite a backlash from the medical establishment.   They are spending a lot of time, effort and money to combat these  “health conspiracy theories”, but as you will see below, quite a few of  them have turned out to be real.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>But before we get to that, I wanted to share with you some of the  specific results of the survey that I mentioned above.  The following  comes from <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/03/19/health-conspiracy-theories/6602775/" target="_blank" title="USA Today">USA Today</a>…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The online survey of 1,351 adults found:<br />
• 37% agree the Food and Drug Administration is keeping <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Natural-Cures-They-Dont-About/dp/0975599593/ref=as_li_tf_sw?&amp;linkCode=wsw&amp;tag=permacultucom-20" target="_blank">“natural  cures for cancer and other diseases”</a> away from the public because of  “pressure from drug companies.”<br />
• 20% believe health officials are hiding evidence that cellphones cause cancer.<br />
• 20% believe doctors and health officials push child vaccines even  though they “know these vaccines cause autism and other psychological  disorders.”<br />
• Smaller numbers endorse theories involving fluoride, genetically  modified foods and the deliberate infection of African Americans with  HIV.<br />
• 49% believe at least one of the theories and 18% believe at least three.</p>

<p>
So there are actually Americans that believe that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Over-Counter-Natural-Cures-Supplements/dp/1402225059/ref=as_li_tf_sw?&amp;linkCode=wsw&amp;tag=permacultucom-20" target="_blank">“natural cures”</a>  exist and that vaccines and fluoride might have some very harmful side  effects?</p>
<p>Oh the horror!</p>
<p>Of course I am being facetious.  The truth is that it is wonderful  that people are starting to research these things for themselves.</p>
<p>The medical community has a huge incentive to protect their turf.  If  the U.S. health care system was a separate nation, it would be <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/depressing-facts-about-healthcare-system-2011-6#if-our-health-care-system-were-its-own-country-it-would-be-the-sixth-largest-economy-in-the-world-29" target="_blank" title="the 6th largest economy">the 6th largest economy</a>  on the entire planet.  Hundreds of billions of dollars a year are at  stake, and so it is very important that they maintain control over what  people believe about their health.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the truth is starting to get out there.  The following  are 10 health <a href="http://www.amazon.com/American-Conspiracies-Dirty-Government-Tells/dp/1616082143/ref=as_li_tf_sw?&amp;linkCode=wsw&amp;tag=permacultucom-20" target="_blank">conspiracy theories</a> that turned out to be real…</p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p><b>Unvaccinated Children Are Far Healthier Than Vaccinated Children</b></p>
<p>Evidence continues <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Vaccination-Voodoo-What-About-Vaccines/dp/1484923820/ref=as_li_tf_sw?&amp;linkCode=wsw&amp;tag=permacultucom-20" target="_blank">to mount that vaccines</a> can have some very harmful side effects – especially for children.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/vaccinetruth.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" height="175" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-38G3VOJQToQ/TfAZ2bc-qRI/AAAAAAAAJQ8/LA-TGAvVeWk/250x250-b.jpg" width="200"></a>For example, a study that was conducted <a href="http://www.naturalblaze.com/2014/02/studies-prove-without-doubt-that.html" target="_blank" title="in New Zealand">in New Zealand</a> discovered that unvaccinated children are generally much healthier than vaccinated children…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
A study from the 1990s has come to light, proving that  compared to unvaccinated children, vaccinated children were more likely  to suffer from asthma, eczema, ear infections, hyperactivity and many  other chronic conditions. Furthermore, the study identified that there  was a ten-fold increase in the incidence of tonsillitis in the children  who were vaccinated, and a total lack tonsillectomy operations among the  children who were unvaccinated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And a similar study that was conducted <a href="http://www.naturalblaze.com/2014/02/studies-prove-without-doubt-that.html" target="_blank" title="in Germany">in Germany</a> came up with similar results…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Asthma, hay fever and neurodermatitis are seen very  frequently today. A recent German study with 17461 children between 0-17  years of age (KIGGS) showed that 4.7% of these children suffer from  asthma, 10.7% of these children from hay fever and 13.2% from  neurodermatitis. These numbers differ in western countries, i.e. the  prevalence of asthma among children in the US is 6% whereas it is 14-16%  in Australia (Australia’s Health 2004, AIHW). </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
The prevalence of asthma among unvaccinated children in our study is  around 2.5%, hay fever, 3%, and neurodermatitis, 7%. According to the  KIGGS study more than 40% of children between the ages of 3 and 17 years  were sensitized against at least one allergen tested (20 common  allergens were tested) and 22.9% had an allergic disease. Although we  did not perform a blood test, around 10% stated that their children had  an allergy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most parents don’t realize this, but when you allow vaccines to be  injected into your children, they are getting all kinds of nasty things  injected directly into their bloodstreams where there is no filter.<b> </b>That is why so many people keep screaming about “the mercury in the vaccines”.  The truth is that it can cause <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/011764.html" target="_blank" title="by Dawn Prate">brain damage</a>…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
In 1977, a Russian study found that adults exposed to ethylmercury, the form of mercury in thimerosal, <b>suffered brain damage</b>  years later. Studies on thimerosal poisoning also describe tubular  necrosis and nervous system injury, including obtundation, coma and  death. As a result of these findings, Russia <b>banned thimerosal</b> from children’s vaccines in 1980. Denmark, Austria, Japan, Great Britain and all the Scandinavian countries <b>have also banned the preservative</b>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So why is thimerosal still found in so many vaccines in the United States?</p>
<p>Today, in some areas of the nation <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-kirby/autism-vaccine-_b_817879.html" target="_blank" title="more than 30 vaccines">more than 30 vaccines</a> are being given to young children before the age of 3.</p>
<p>30 vaccines.</p>
<p>That is utter insanity.</p>
<p><b>The Use Of Antidepressants By Mothers Has Been Scientifically Linked To Autism In Their Babies</b></p>
<p>When women take things when they are pregnant, it can have a very serious impact on their unborn children.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Children whose mothers take Zoloft, Prozac, or similar antidepressants during pregnancy are <b>twice as likely</b>  as other children to have a diagnosis of autism or a related disorder,  according to a small new study, the first to examine the relationship  between antidepressants and autism risk.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
This class of antidepressants, known as selective serotonin reuptake  inhibitors (SSRIs), may be especially risky early on in a pregnancy, the  study suggests. Children who were exposed to the drugs <b>during the first trimester</b> were <b>nearly four times as likely</b>  to develop an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) compared with unexposed  children, according to the study, which appears in the Archives of  General Psychiatry.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>1.</b> Fluoride exposure disrupts the  synthesis of collagen and leads to the breakdown of collagen in bone,  tendon, muscle, skin, cartilage, lungs, kidney and trachea. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>2.</b> Fluoride stimulates granule formation and oxygen  consumption in white blood cells, but inhibits these processes when the  white blood cell is challenged by a foreign agent in the blood. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>3.</b> Fluoride depletes the energy reserves and the  ability of white blood cells to properly destroy foreign agents by the  process of phagocytosis. As little as 0.2 ppm fluoride stimulates  superoxide production in resting white blood cells, virtually abolishing  phagocytosis. Even micro-molar amounts of fluoride, below 1 ppm, may  seriously depress the ability of white blood cells to destroy pathogenic  agents. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>4.</b> Fluoride confuses the immune system and causes it  to attack the body’s own tissues, and increases the tumor growth rate  in cancer prone individuals. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>5.</b> Fluoride inhibits antibody formation in the blood. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>6.</b> Fluoride depresses thyroid activity. </p>

<p>
<b>7.</b> Fluorides have a disruptive effect on various tissues in the body. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>9.</b> Fluorides cause premature aging of the human body. </p>

<p><b>The Overprescription Of Antibiotics Is Causing The Rise Of Antibiotic-Resistant “Superbugs”</b></p>
<p>These days, doctors are prescribing antibiotics at the drop of a hat.</p>
<p>For a long time that worked, but now we are <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rising-Plague-Bacteria-Dwindling-Arsenal/dp/1591027500/ref=as_li_tf_sw?&amp;linkCode=wsw&amp;tag=permacultucom-20" target="_blank">seeing the rise of a new  generation of “superbugs”</a> that are totally resistant to antibiotics.</p>
<p>The reason that this is a problem is that we don’t have anything that can fight these new superbugs.<br />

<p>
The dangers from overprescribing antibiotics in hospitals are  twofold, Srinivasan explained. First, patients may not need them and  could suffer side effects.

<p>But now even the mainstream media is admitting this.  For example, the following is an excerpt from a recent article <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/27/health/exploring-salines-secret-costs.html?_r=0" target="_blank" title="in the New York Times">in the New York Times</a>…</p>

<p>
Luckily for anyone who has ever needed an IV bag to  replenish lost fluids or to receive medication, it is also one of the  least expensive. The average manufacturer’s price, according to  government data, has fluctuated in recent years <b>from 44 cents to $1</b>. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
Yet there is nothing either cheap or simple about its ultimate cost,  as I learned when I tried to trace the commercial path of IV bags from  the factory to the veins of more than 100 patients struck by a May 2012  outbreak of food poisoning in upstate New York. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
Some of the patients’ bills would later include markups of <b>100 to 200 times</b>  the manufacturer’s price, not counting separate charges for “IV  administration.” And on other bills, a bundled charge for “IV therapy”  was <b>almost 1,000 times</b> the official cost of the solution.</p>

There were also  four boxes of sterile gauze pads for $77 each. None of that was  considered part of what was provided in return for Seton’s facility  charge for the intensive-care unit for two days at $13,225 a day, 12  days in the critical unit at $7,315 a day and one day in a standard room  (all of which totaled $120,116 over 15 days).

Prescription drugs kill some 200,000 Americans every  year. Will that number go up, now that most clinical trials are  conducted overseas—on sick Russians, homeless Poles, and slum-dwelling  Chinese—in places where regulation is virtually nonexistent, the F.D.A.  doesn’t reach, and “mistakes” can end up in pauper’s graves?</p>
<p><b>Caffeine Addiction Is Real And It Can Be Incredibly Difficult To Break</b></p>
<p>If you have ever been addicted to coffee or soda, you probably know how hard it can be to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Boiron-Homeopathic-Medicine-Coffea-Pellets/dp/B00014EK9C/ref=as_li_tf_sw?&amp;linkCode=wsw&amp;tag=permacultucom-20" target="_blank">try to give it up</a> for even a few days.</p>
<p>It has been estimated that up to 90 percent of all Americans consume  beverages that contain caffeine, and most people never stop to think  about how it might affect them in the long run.</p>
<p>Well, experts are now openly acknowledging that we have a major  caffeine addiction problem on our hands.  The following is an excerpt  from a recent article <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/health/article/Caffeine-dependence-tied-to-physical-emotional-5288887.php?cmpid=twitter#page-1" target="_blank" title="in the San Francisco Chronicle">in the San Francisco Chronicle</a>…</p>

<p>
Cardiologists have told patients to cut back on coffee  because they’re having heart palpitations, and psychologists have warned  people that their caffeine habit may be adding to their anxiety  problems.

<blockquote>
<p>
Even sleep experts say patients will complain of insomnia but shudder at the idea of quitting caffeine. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
“There are people who have chronic reflux, stomach acid pain,  bleeding, hemorrhoids – all because of coffee. They’re suffering a lot,”  said Keith Humphreys, a Stanford addiction expert. “But they try and  they fail to stop.”</p>

<p><b>Eating Pork Is Really Bad For You</b></p>
<p>Americans have a love affair with pork.  We consume massive amounts of bacon, ham, sausage, pepperoni, etc.</p>
<p>But is that actually healthy for us?</p>
<p>Most people have never stopped to consider this, but they should.  The following is an excerpt from a paper entitled “<a href="https://healthmasters.com/blog/adverse-influence-pork-consumption-health" target="_blank" title="The Adverse Influence Of Pork Consumption On Health">The Adverse Influence Of Pork Consumption On Health</a>” by Professor Hans-Heinrich Reckeweg…</p>

It is obvious that this does not only apply to  preparations of fresh pork such as cold cuts, knuckles, feet, ribs and  cutlets, etc., but also to cured meats (ham, bacon, etc.) and to smoked  meats prepared for sausages. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
Consumption of freshly killed pork products causes acute responses,  such as inflammations of the appendix and gall bladder, biliary colics,  acute intestinal catarrh, gastroenteritis with typhoid and paratyphoid  symptoms, as well as acute eczema, carbuncles, sudoriparous abscesses,  and others. These symptoms can be observed after consuming sausage meats  (including salami which contains pieces of bacon in the form of fat).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And here are some more reasons why you should <a href="http://www.theherbdoc.com/ConsumerEducation/Reference/PorkFacts.htm" target="_blank" title="think twice">think twice</a> about eating pork…</p>
<ul>
<li>
<div align="JUSTIFY">
A pig is a real garbage gut. It will eat anything  including urine, excrement, dirt, decaying animal flesh, maggots, or  decaying vegetables. They will even eat the cancerous growths off other  pigs or animals.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="JUSTIFY">
The meat and fat of a pig absorbs toxins like a sponge. Their meat can be 30 times more toxic than beef or venison.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="JUSTIFY">
When eating beef or venison, it takes 8 to 9 hours to  digest the meat so what little toxins are in the meat are slowly put  into our system and can be filtered by the liver. But when pork is  eaten, it takes only 4 hours to digest the meat. We thus get a much  higher level of toxins within a shorter time.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="JUSTIFY">
Unlike other mammals, a pig does not sweat or  perspire. Perspiration is a means by which toxins are removed from the  body. Since a pig does not sweat, the toxins remain within its body and  in the meat.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="JUSTIFY">
Pigs and swine are so poisonous that you can hardly  kill them with strychnine or other poisons. Farmers will often pen up  pigs within a rattlesnake nest because the pigs will eat the snakes, and  if bitten they will not be harmed by the venom.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="JUSTIFY">
When a pig is butchered, worms and insects take to  its flesh sooner and faster than to other animal’s flesh. In a few days  the swine flesh is full of worms.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="JUSTIFY">
Swine and pigs have over a dozen parasites within  them, such as tapeworms, flukes, worms, and trichinae. There is no safe  temperature at which pork can be cooked to ensure that all these  parasites, their cysts, and eggs will be killed.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="JUSTIFY">
Pig meat has twice as much fat as beef. A three-ounce  T-bone steak contains 8.5 grams of fat; a three-ounce pork chop  contains 18 grams of fat. A three-ounce beef rib has 11.1 grams of fat; a  three-ounce pork spare rib has 23.2 grams of fat.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="JUSTIFY">
Cows have a complex digestive system, having four  stomachs. It thus takes over 24 hours to digest their vegetarian diet  causing its food to be purified of toxins. In contrast, the swine’s one  stomach takes only about four hours to digest its foul diet, turning its  toxic food into flesh.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="JUSTIFY">
The swine carries about 30 diseases which can be  easily passed to humans. This is why God commanded that we are not even  to touch their carcass. (Leviticus 11:8).</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="JUSTIFY">
The trichinae worm of the swine is microscopically  small, and once ingested can lodge itself in our intestines, muscles,  spinal cord or the brain. This results in the disease trichinosis. The  symptoms are sometimes lacking, but when present they are mistaken for  other diseases, such as typhoid, arthritis, rheumatism, gastritis, MS,  meningitis, gall bladder trouble, or acute alcoholism.</div>

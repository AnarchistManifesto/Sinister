<p>Maintaining good health is a major issue for each of us. If asked, “How are you doing?”, can you legitimately answer, “Really well”?</p>
<p>The level of well being is far less than it should be for most people. We deserve to be fully healthy, with minimal stress, but we are being abused with both stress and poisons on purpose.</p>
<p><b>STRESS</b></p>
<p>Just think about how much life and health have changed in the last 100 years or so, and how rapid the changes have been compared to any other time in known history.</p>
<p>Do you realize that each of us is still reeling from all these changes?</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>Our minds can perceive the revolution that has occurred in just three generations, but our emotions, thought processes, speech, and physical health have not adapted to the stresses of it all.</p>
<p>What has happened during this period of the lives of our grandparents, parents and ourselves, such as diminished food quality, pollution, addiction, crazy behavior, war and more war, economic dislocation, increasing surveillance, hypnotic mind control and growing tyranny, has had many unhealthy repercussions.</p>
<p>Now the Internet, wireless communications, and information overload have brought on an even greater revolution.</p>
<p>Problems and challenges of life throughout the centuries have made it difficult for most individuals to accomplish a sense of well-being and find spiritual fulfillment.</p>

<p>
With the conveniences of modern life this should be MORE possible. However, the rat race attitude of “get what I can as fast as I can”, coupled with the distractions presented by electronic media keep many of us from focusing on the more important principle of helping ourselves and others to total wellness and well being.</p>
<p>In a United States study conducted at Indiana University back in 1996, the number of adults indicating that they had felt close to a nervous breakdown was over 26 percent. Altogether about 1/3 of respondents acknowledged that they have had a mental health problem of some sort. Even then there were likely many more than these who were unable to recognize or admit that they had some difficulties? How much worse is it now?</p>
<p>Stress situations are abundant in today’s fast-paced society. Deadlines and other time pressures, financial worries, traffic jams and incidents, waiting in line, disagreement, people being mean and obnoxious, the threat of disaster, encroaching tyranny — these are a few of the common sources of stress. </p>
<p>Financial problems are the greatest source of stress for many people. Those who have ever been unable to pay the rent or mortgage, or received utility shut-off notices or calls from collectors, or been unable to get credit when needed, have likely known anxiety. How about those who are homeless or don’t have enough food? </p>
<p>The situation does not need to be that bad to be stressful, however. Like thieves, interest, inflation and income taxes can clean out your wallet without your realizing what has happened. Business and investment losses, debt, being short for meeting bills on time, all are well-known stress factors.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/organics.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-5nLmWzKFs60/URRNIOJzCiI/AAAAAAAAUEc/HqENLf1jZeM/s250/BANNER150.jpg"></a>There are reasons why disturbance in relational harmony seems to be the norm. Lack of understanding about how the mind and emotions work and how to best deal with the problems that arise in life, leads to much tension that interferes with people getting along with each other. Issues in this complex area of life include manipulation and control, vulnerability, inability to express emotions, attitude, and problems with communication.</p>
<p>Most people build up tension in their lives from running this rat race — too much to do, too little time to do it — not enough money to meet obligations — pressure from other people — relationship issues — and concern about the growing social, economic and political problems.</p>
<p><b>POISONS</b></p>
<p>We are living in an environment of <a href="http://publicpoisons.com/">public poisons</a> on purpose. Our food, water, air and medicines have all become vehicles of this poisoning.</p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>Foods contain pesticide, herbicides, fungicides, as well as additives for flavor, color, taste or preservation. Some of the common toxic qualities include: Aspartame, MSG, sugar, chlorine, fluoride, antibiotics, steroids and Genetically Modified (GMO) components.</p>
<p>Nearly every city adds highly toxic chlorine and fluoride to the public water. Additionally it contains chemical contaminants from agriculture, industry and medical waste. Even if you go out of your way to purify your tap water, these chemicals are often in the food and beverage products.</p>
<p>Airborne chemicals and particulates are everywhere from industry, agriculture and other sources of pollution. </p>
<p><a href="http://chemtrailer.com/">Chemtrails</a> are sprayed in the sky every few days in most areas of North America. This routine spraying of toxic agents in the air from jet airplanes in what is called “stratospheric aerosol geo-engineering” has been generating increased respiratory ailments. </p>
<p>The metal salts of aluminum, barium, strontium, thorium and cadmium, some of them radioactive, silver iodide, sulfur dioxide (maker of “acid rain”), sulfur hexafluoride, plastic fibers and micro-crystals, and BIOLOGICAL SUBSTANCES, including mold and fungal spores, algae, bacteria, blood cells and insect eggs, that are being released in the chemtrails, are nearly all harmful to humans, animals and plants.</p>
<p>They spray in rural areas as well as cities, contaminating the air, water and ground everywhere with their toxic fog, harming people, animals and plants. </p>
<p>The nuclear plant in Fukushima, Japan, has been an ongoing source of expanding radiation since the first earthquake and nuclear disaster there in 2011. There is still fallout of radioactive particles in much of the northern hemisphere. The mainstream media does not report about this.</p>
<p>The Fukushima nuclear plant remains very vulnerable to a worse release. The rods in storage are being inadequately cooled and need to be removed, which itself is a highly dangerous process. There was recently another major earthquake as well as a typhoon hitting near that area. There could be a worse event anytime. The radiation coming our way could increase to an unlivable level. In any case, the deadly contamination in the Northern Hemisphere will continue to accumulate.</p>
<p>Most pharmaceutical medicines are chemical agents that are not compatible with biological organisms. Rather than correct a health imbalance, most drugs block or mask symptoms, while causing side effects that often become problems treated by added medicines. Meanwhile, the body and brain deteriorate.</p>
<p>You and your loved ones are swallowing and breathing many health damaging substances, much of it WITHOUT YOUR KNOWLEDGE OR CONSENT.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.globalhealingcenter.com/organic-living/radiation-protection/cell-phone-emf.html?a_aid=174763&amp;a_bid=615b3fe6" style="clear: left;float: left;margin-bottom: 0em;margin-right: 1em" target="_top"><img alt="Protect Yourself From Cell Phone Radiation - SafeSpace Cell Phone Protector" height="125" src="https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/CellPhone125x125-11.jpg" title="Protect Yourself From Cell Phone Radiation - SafeSpace Cell Phone Protector" width="125"></a>You would have to wear a high-grade respiratory equipment to avoid breathing the nano-particles, and thoroughly clean your water and food to decontaminate them. When chemical particles enter our body, the body turns on its cleansing mechanisms, and the immune system is put on active duty. So we are in constant alert mode from the great amount of pollutants in our food, water and air.</p>
<p>The long-term effects of being regularly exposed to <a href="http://reallywell.com/emf.htm">electromagnetic fields</a> such as computers, television, <a href="http://cellphoneharm.org/">cell phones</a> and fluorescent lights are also detrimental to health. </p>
<p><b>HOW MUCH DISTRESS?</b></p>
<p>Nearly all illness, from a slight infection or “cold” to life-threatening cancer or AIDS, is at least partly attributable to distress — either trauma or anxiety. There so many fears and traumas in the average person’s life that can contribute to an accumulative effect on cells and tissues.</p>
<p>DISTRESS effects us all. Health &amp; financial problems are epidemic. Distress can be cumulative: pressures building, changes, interactions, threats, taking on more responsibilities, new issues to deal with, toxins, overexposure to electromagnetic fields, fear and so forth. How much can one person take? </p>
<p>Like the weather, the conditions of life can change, gradually or suddenly. You can react to stress on a scale from relaxation to panic. People tend to overreact to problem events or perceived circumstances, or to ignore them or put them out of mind to avoid upset. How you respond determines the level of tension in your muscles and organs. </p>
<p>It is possible to clear the mind of running the routine tape of concerns and worries. By releasing the constant preoccupation with mental chatter such as appearance, schedule, planning, second-guessing your words or choices, and so on, you can be present-minded for what is occurring at the moment, even if it is a challenge that addressed.</p>
<p>Some amount of distress is unavoidable. If we learn to look for the good, the lesson, the opportunity in a problem, we can respond to it in a more positive and constructive way. This is especially valuable for an important event or encounter. However, it may be easier said than done.</p>
<p><b>RELAXATION</b></p>
<p>Relaxation can result from a variety of activities, helpers and interests: exercise, sleep, oxygen (full breathing, time outdoors, aerobics, supplemental oxygen), music, art, reading, fragrances, beauty, exploring the imagination, developing love and intimacy with relatives and friends — all this can help us to relax inhibiting tension.  </p>
<p>Some ideas and techniques that can contribute to relaxation are: </p>
<ol>
<li>being prepared for upcoming situations, and, to the degree possible, for future problem scenarios; </li>
<li>effective time management; </li>
<li>clearing unresolved emotions, especially fears, by learning to “go with the flow”; </li>
<li>deep breathing and exercises that get more oxygen to the cells of the body; </li>
<li>massage of the body’s muscles; </li>
<li>soft and pleasant music; </li>
<li>pleasant relaxing aromas; </li>
<li>contemplative meditation to clear the mind of perplexing or disturbing thoughts; and </li>
<li>putting yourself in situations where there is a high potential for joy, creative expression or sharing a touching moment with someone you care about. This could be a walk, a children’s event, a moving performance, or just time with a loved one.</li>
</ol>
<p>Older children and adults can learn better habits to relax anxiety periodically throughout the day: deep breathing, self-massage, mental breaks, meditation moments and short naps.</p>
<p><i>Meditation</i></p>
<p>Take time to focus on relaxing at times during the day.  One possibility is to imagine being in a relaxing scene — a pleasant field of flowers and grass with a gurgling stream flowing by. Many insights and creative ideas as well as relaxation come to people who take the time to meditate for 15 minutes or so each day.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.globalhealingcenter.com/intelli-pro-air-purifier.html?a_aid=174763&amp;a_bid=777f8ed5" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 0em;margin-left: 1em" target="_top"><img alt="Breathe Easy With Advanced Air Purifiers - Multi-Tech Intelli-Pro Improves Air Quality" height="125" src="http://www.globalhealingcenter.com/pap/accounts/default1/banners/MultiTech_IntelliPro125x125.jpg" title="Breathe Easy With Advanced Air Purifiers - Multi-Tech Intelli-Pro Improves Air Quality" width="125"></a><i>Breath</i></p>
<p>Getting enough oxygen is important for all bodily functions. Many of us breathe in too shallow a manner, worsening our oxygen deficiency, which has already developed due to insufficient oxygen in today’s atmosphere. Breathing fully and getting outdoors, especially in the woods or by the sea, as well as aerobic exercise are all very important for health and relaxation.</p>
<p>Regular exercise is relaxing, whether vigorous and “aerobic” (oxygenating), or a simple series of tensing and relaxing muscles step-by-step throughout the body. Aerobic exercise is needed for oxygenation of tissues, and to tone and strengthen the heart.  </p>
<p><i>Sleep</i></p>
<p>Good sleep is essential to good health and to performing at your best. This is the time the body does its healing repair work. As Shakespeare put it, sleep “knits up the raveled sleeve of care”.</p>
<p>Choose a safe, dark place to sleep nightly, which is separate from the areas where you spend you time when awake. Go to bed and get up at the same times daily. Think about plans or worries in the morning or on the way to work or on errands, not at bedtime.</p>
<p>The body gets its best sleep during the dark hours, a problem for those who work at night. A healthy pineal gland has a natural clock function, set in relation to the sun.  It would function to awaken each of us shortly after dawn if we were not still sleeping deeply from exhaustion. The pineal is important for our imagination and creativity also. It is impaired by intake of fluoride, another reason to avoid that abusive poison.</p>
<p>For those with difficulty getting to sleep or staying asleep, when the above relaxation exercise doesn’t help, try supplementation with high quality <a href="http://reallywell.com/calcium.htm">calcium</a> and/or <a href="http://reallywell.com/magnesium.htm">magnesium</a> an hour or two before bed.  If you still have trouble, there is <a href="http://reallywell.com/sleep.htm#Melatonin">melatonin</a>, a natural hormone in which you may be deficient, that is available as a supplement.  </p>
<p>The <a href="http://reallywell.com/sleep.htm#Order_Natural_Sleep_Aids">herbs</a> valerian root, hops, passion flower and chamomile help with nervousness, anxiety and tension, assisting one to relax. Valerian root is the original source of the compounds used in the calmative medicine Valium. <a href="http://herbup.com/st_johnswort.htm">St. John’s wort</a> is known for helping with depression without the side effects of Prozac. Another option is a homeopathic treatment for calming or sleep. Homeopathic remedies are prepared with a tiny amount of a substance to provide its energy without any toxic or allergic reactions.</p>
<p>Children need a lot of good sleep. Many do not get enough and it effects them in various ways. Establish a bedtime routine for younger children: a bath, a short book, and bedtime at 8 or 8:30 pm with no variance.</p>
<p>Ideally, adults would sleep from 10 or 11 pm to 6 or 7 am. We really should turn off the “tubes” earlier. The TV and computer are not really relaxing. Enjoyable reading, especially an inspiring work, or a pleasant conversation, are good ways to wind down before bed. </p>
<p>Anyone who does not get as much sleep as they need will have a deficiency. You cannot operate at your best with sleep deprivation; and it can be a danger to yourself and others if you are driving, operating equipment or working with tools while tired. </p>
<p>You do not successfully catch up on missed sleep by “sleeping in” on weekends. To restore your diminished “sleep account”, lengthen the time of sleep at night. A 30- to 60-minute nap during the day can be refreshing as well.</p>
<p><i>Other Ideas</i></p>
<p>Limit your exposure to negative news and horrible images on television. Receiving information over the radio or by newspaper, e-mail, Internet or phone, allows your mind to create the images which can be less impacting and stressful. Nonetheless, limit the negative exposure from all sources.</p>
<p>Pleasant music, enjoyable reading, good conversation, writing, wonderful fragrances, the beauty of art and nature, and exploring the imagination, are all ways of relaxing. Everyone of us needs to foster love and intimacy by spending good time with relatives and friends. </p>
<p>Most important is the cultivation of the spiritual aspect of life — attending to your relationship with God.</p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>Once stress control is understood better, there should be more willingness to risk an improving action. Difficulties encountered in dealing with a challenge will not be insurmountable. Any such new problems can be handled. Stress can be managed, cleared and surpassed. After all, it is least stressful to do what comes naturally — to move ahead.</p>
<p><b>IMMUNE SYSTEM UNDER STRESS</b></p>
<p><a href="http://www.globalhealingcenter.com/supplements/detoxadine.html?a_aid=174763&amp;a_bid=574a3bd8" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em" target="_top"><img alt="High Quality Iodine Supplement - Detoxadine" height="125" src="http://www.globalhealingcenter.com/pap/accounts/default1/banners/Detoxadine125x125.jpg" title="High Quality Iodine Supplement - Detoxadine" width="125"></a>Challenges to the <a href="http://reallywell.com/immune.htm">immune system</a> can be very serious. Many people have died in battling some types of germs, even in recent times, as well as in times past. Authorities and the media have warned of the possibility of a pandemic (widespread communicable disease).</p>
<p>Almost everyone has some form of herpes virus present in their system, and most have yeast overgrowth. There are worse viruses than herpes out there, some more deadly than HIV. </p>
<p>Immune strength may not be adequate to meet the challenges, especially since the vaccinations most people received in childhood generally weaken the immune system, perhaps for the rest of life.</p>
<p>Also, new and meaner strains of bacteria are developing, and some of them have become resistant to antibiotics. MRSA (Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus) is one that can be lethal. The broad overuse of antibiotics, including adding it to livestock feed, has given these microbes the opportunity to develop such resistance.</p>
<p>In my opinion, <a href="http://reallywell.com/no_vaccination.htm">“flu shots” and vaccines</a> are not solutions.</p>
<p>Further, the government and its affiliated universities and corporations have researched viruses as biological weapons for more than half a century.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.infowars.com/viruses-and-the-gm-insect-flying-vaccine-solution/">Click here</a> for an article on government and university tests for delivering viruses and vaccines via mosquitoes.</p>
<p>Dr. Daryl See, world renowned researcher and virologist, is concerned about the lack of effective medicines to deal with developing viruses.</p>
<div class="code-block code-block-1" style="margin: 0px">
<div align="center" class="mrf-external">
<a href="https://amorain.com/?E=ikLQsSIi%2fgaXBh0SRK5s8g%3d%3d&amp;s1="><img src="https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/500.jpg"></a></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center"><a href="https://amorain.com/?E=ikLQsSIi%2fgaXBh0SRK5s8g%3d%3d&amp;s1=" target="_blank">Secret $1.8 Million Cryptocurrency Script</a></h4>
</div>
<p>Dr. See has stated, “We live in a world with more and more dangerous infectious diseases. We virologists are shaking in our boots.”  </p>
<p>He is worried about a potential flu pandemic that they project, “could kill up to 60 MILLION people around the world, with 1 million or more right here in America.”</p>
<p>The reason people are susceptible to illness from microbes is that their immune systems have become weak due to a lifestyle of stress, toxicity and malnutrition. The body becomes overly acid and conditions are hospitable to invading microorganisms.</p>
<p>Most of the body’s fluid is lymph, which carries nutrients to cells and wastes away from cells. The lymph and the blood can become overwhelmed with toxins from the common diet and lifestyle, and <a href="http://publicpoisons.com/">environmental poisons</a>, particularly if too little pure water is consumed.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.globalhealingcenter.com/organic-living/water-purification/wellness-water-carafe.html?a_aid=174763&amp;a_bid=9622ebf5" style="clear: left;float: left;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-right: 1em" target="_top"><img alt="Purify Your Drinking Water - Wellness Carafe" height="125" src="http://www.globalhealingcenter.com/pap/accounts/default1/banners/WellnessCarafe125x125.jpg" title="Purify Your Drinking Water - Wellness Carafe" width="125"></a>Without one to two quarts of pure water per day, the lymph and the blood can become thickened like sludge. Further, exercise and deep breathing are needed to move the lymph fluid along so that the waste can be processed.</p>
<p>How vulnerable are you? The truth is that it depends on how strong, how prepared, and how responsive your immune system is. It is NOT chemical “miracle” drugs that will save you. It will be your immune system that will protect and save you, or not!</p>
<p>It is crucial to build immune system health now and for good. A strong immune system is absolutely needed to handle the immune challenges that are already circulating, with more to come.</p>
<p>Medical authorities are completely aware of the potential for catastrophe, and admit that they are concerned and frustrated.</p>
<p>Even so, they remain reluctant to speak openly about what many consider to be inevitable; a world essentially unable to defend itself against an onslaught of diseases for which there remains no effective medical treatment.</p>
<p>The miracle “chemical” drugs that we have relied on to fight and control disease for the past 50 years have been coming back to haunt us, with a vengeance. The perception in the 1960’s that we had conquered almost every infectious disease has become nothing more than an illusion. Tiny but powerful antibiotic resistant germs are out there. </p>
<p>It has been known since the dawn of the “antibiotic age”, in the 1940s, that the more an antibiotic is used, the quicker it becomes useless, simply because of natural selection. The drugs do kill most of the bacteria, but the fittest will survive, and pass on survival traits to their offspring, creating even stronger pathogens.</p>
<p>Since 1978, over 30 previously unknown infectious diseases, have been identified, and new ones are still being discovered. These have caused hundreds of thousands of serious health problems and hospitalizations, and tens of thousands of deaths. Many of the old ones, like tuberculosis, are staging a comeback. </p>
<p>There are more deaths from TB now than at any time in history. In New York City, alone, TB is a greater problem than in many Third World countries.</p>
<p>According to Dr. James Hughes, Director of the National Center for Infectious Disease (NCID), “We’re facing a serious global problem with antimicrobial resistance now, and it affects virtually all of the pathogens we previously considered very treatable. Today, we have only one drug to treat some infections, and once they become resistant to that one drug, we will basically be back in the pre-antibiotic era.”</p>
<p>Dr. David Williams, author, researcher and medical practitioner, has warned that, “. . . wave after wave of drug-resistant bacteria will sweep over the planet, killing millions. The onslaught has already begun!”</p>
<p>Well over 100,000 people die every year in America from hospital-acquired infections.</p>
<p>Further, the threat of bio-weapons has been an ever present danger for many years. A deadly contagious virus or bacteria could be unleashed on purpose at any time.</p>
<p><b>HEALTH HELP</b></p>
<p>In addition to getting good rest, minimizing junk foods such as sugar (which shuts down the immune system), detoxifying and alkalizing the body, cleaning your hands, and covering your nose and mouth at appropriate times, there are special nutritional supplements that assist the body in detoxifying, rebuilding and provide immune support in dealing with invaders.</p>
<p>Take action now to protect yourself and your loved ones. It is wise to have some of the following natural supportive agents on hand, including: <a href="http://reallywell.com/superfoods.htm">super foods</a>, <a href="http://reallywell.com/lungs.htm">lung support</a>, <a href="http://reallywell.com/detox.htm">detox agents</a>, <a href="http://reallywell.com/antioxidants.htm">antioxidants</a>, <a href="http://reallywell.com/enzymes.htm">enzymes</a>, <a href="http://reallywell.com/silver.htm">consumable silver</a>, <a href="http://reallywell.com/larrea.htm">larrea</a>, <a href="http://herbup.com/ech_gold.htm">echinacea</a>, <a href="http://herbup.com/ech_gold.htm">goldenseal</a>, <a href="http://herbup.com/garlic.htm">garlic</a>, <a href="http://herbup.com/oregano_oil.htm">oregano oil</a>, <a href="http://herbup.com/olive_leaf.htm">olive leaf</a>, <a href="http://herbup.com/pau_darco.htm">pau d’arco</a>, <a href="http://reallywell.com/oxygen.htm">oxygen drops</a>, and <a href="http://reallywell.com/probiotics.htm">probiotics</a>. </p>
<p>Those with “autoimmune” problems, can use some of these items that do not actually stimulate the immune activity.</p>
<p>There are many sources of stress and toxicity living in the world of today. To be as healthy as possible, we need to intentionally learn how and take the necessary actions to relax stress, avoid poisons and eat and drink for health. </p>
<p>Helping each other investigate what is going on and sharing important knowledge improves our potential for well-being.</p>

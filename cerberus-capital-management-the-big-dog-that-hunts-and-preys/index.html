<p>Cerberus is named after the mythological three-headed dog that guarded the gates of Hades aka the (Bill?) Gates of Hell.</p>
<p>With a serpent’s tail, a mane of snakes, and a lion’s claws, it  guards the entrance of Hell to prevent those who entered from ever  escaping. Cerberus is featured in many works of ancient Greek and Roman  literature and in works of both ancient and modern art and architecture.</p>
<p>This week, Cerberus Capital Management announced it was buying  Safeway Supermarkets for $9 billion, just as California is going into a  never before experienced historical water and food crisis. Their timing  is incredible in that after this acquisition they will have more than doubled their control over our major supermarkets in California and beyond.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>Last year, a Cerberus-led investor group spent $3.3 billion in cash  and debt assumption buying 887 stores from Supervalu Inc., with the  names Albertsons, Acme, Jewel-Osco, Shaw’s and StarMarket. Cerberus  already owned some Albertsons stores, which it bought in 2006. In the  fall, Albertsons said it would buy 50 stores operated by Texan chain  United Supermarkets.</p>
<p>In the U.S., more than 19% of market share in the U.S. grocery  industry belongs to Kroger, whose chains include Ralphs and Food 4 Less,  according to Euromonitor International. Safeway, which has 1,335  stores, follows with 9.1%. Albertsons and its 1,075 stores closing out  the top five with a 3.8% share. Kroger and Safeway also have mutual  agreements to accept each others “club cards”.  <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-safeway-albertsons-merger-20140307,0,2474407.story#ixzz2vIrFEb3g">(Source).</a></p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

On a relevant sidebar, Safeway this week settled a lawsuit brought  about by 9 Northern California counties and had to pay out $2.5 million  because Safeway charged consumers more than the lowest advertised  prices, misrepresented the weights of Safeway brand products and implied  that some produce was “locally grown” when it had come from out of the  country.</p>
<p>The complaint also alleged that Safeway failed to abide by a 2008  injunction requiring it to minimize price discrepancies by offering  customers free items or $5 gift cards when pricing flaws occurred. In  its statement, Safeway said it would “take additional steps to make our  scan guarantee policy more visible to our customers and well-understood  by our employees”. <a href="http://www.marinij.com/marinnews/ci_25292040/marin-da-says-safeway-will-pay-2-3">(Source)</a></p>
<p>Additionally, last week’s news that the Federal water agency that  doles out water from the Sierras to 3300 water suppliers throughout  California had this to say to all residents and commercial farmers of  California: “We cannot give what we don’t have. It’s just not there.” (<a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2014/02/state-of-farm-and-water-report-for.html" target="_blank">Source</a>)</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/foodcrisis.html" rel="nofollow" style="float: right;margin-bottom: 0em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-gSYYiihhpjI/TtEcIO54fhI/AAAAAAAAM2s/G6yL-FN6K7A/s261/foodcrisis-160-2.gif"></a>The Federal government is setting precedent by breaking a 54-year  agreement with the state to provide water to all of California from  mountain runoff. The critical problem, according to the head of the  Federal Water Agency is, “It’s just not there”, meaning the snowpack  from the Sierras that allows the Feds to allot the water to the state  for the coming year ahead.</p>
<p>The state’s worst drought in decades has left its reservoirs  half-naked, if not skeletal. Officials say 17 communities could run out  of drinking water this summer, some are considering mandatory rationing,  and 500,000 acres in the state may be left fallow. For the first time  in its 54-year history, the California State Water Project—the world’s  biggest plumbing network and the way millions of state residents get  hundreds of billions of gallons of water—is essentially shutting down.</p>
<p>In 2012 the project moved 815 billion gallons of fresh water from  Northern California’s rivers to 25 million people and a million acres of  farmland in the arid central and southern parts of the state. Last  year, the driest on record, the system delivered 490 billion gallons,  down 40 percent. This year, the planned water distribution is zero.  Two-thirds of California’s 38 million people and most of its $45 billion  farm products depend on snowmelt from the Sierra Nevada and Rocky  Mountain watersheds, imported via thousands of miles of pipelines,  canals, and the Colorado River.</p>
<p>Although snowfall is up this winter in the Rockies, precipitation in  both mountain watersheds has been going down over the last 14 years,  raising scary questions for the nation’s most populous state.</p>
<p>So who is this Cerberus Capital Management with its impeccable timing  to acquire critical food distribution sources just as food prices in  the U.S. are about to soar due to America’s breadbasket being empty come  mid-summertime?</p>
<p>Let’s take a deeper look at the how dots connect.</p>
<p>Cerberus manages more than $20 billion in capital. Together, the  companies it owns generate annual revenue of about $60 billion — more  than either Amazon, Cisco, McDonald’s or Coca-Cola. With just 200 of its  own employees, Cerberus owns or has pieces of over 50 companies with  more than 175,000 employees.</p>
<p>Mr. Dan Quayle, former VP of the United States and who served with  former President George H. W. Bush Sr., joined Cerberus in 1999 and is  chairman of the company’s Global Investments Division. Former Treasury  Secretary, John Snow is also on the Cerberus payroll.</p>

<p>Behind the scenes at Cerberus is the secretive Co-Founder CEO,  Stephen A. Feinberg. The low-profile Feinberg moves in rarefied circles.  Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld was an investor in 2001 in his  fund, according to government ethics disclosures. Hedge-fund legend  Michael Steinhardt is a shareholder and director in Cerberus’ lending  arm, Ableco LLC. Michael Dell’s private-investment firm has joined with  Cerberus and home-builder Lennar Corp. to develop upscale residential  communities. His roster of investors also includes public pension funds  such as TIAA-CREF and the largest pension fund in the country,  California State Teachers’ Retirement System.</p>

<p>Feinberg has been described as “secretive” in the <i>New York Times</i>.  In 2007, Feinberg told Cerberus shareholders, “If anyone at Cerberus  has his picture in the paper and a picture of his apartment, we will do  more than fire that person. We will kill him.

<p>Cerebus Capital Management owns DynCorp, the private data collection  agency for the alphabet spy agencies. (CIA, DHS, NSA, FBI, DEA, etc.).  Cerberus bought DynCorp for $1.5 billion in 2006. <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/12/AR2010041201758.html">(Source)</a></p>
<p>DynCorp is one of the three preeminent private mercenary corporations  in the world, and is the dominant entity for training security forces  in the Middle East. Herbert “Pug” Winokur a lead investor and creator of  DynCorp—he was CEO from 1987 to 1991—previously chaired the finance  committee at Enron, where he somehow escaped the scrutiny of federal  prosecutors.</p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>DynCorp is ubiquitous; it manages the congressional telephone system  and does the computerized bookkeeping for a dozen federal agencies,  including DOD and HUD, and as such has presided over the loss (or theft)  of trillions of dollars. DynCorp has a contract to manage the police  and court systems in the US-occupied Iraq. Arthur Anderson is the  financial auditor of DynCorp, the same auditor which handled Enron’s  books. The HUD Inspector General testified before Congress that HUD had  lost $17 billion in 1998 and $59 billion in 1999.</p>
<p>In September, 2001 it was disclosed that the Pentagon could not  account for $1.1 trillion for the fiscal year 2000. In a separate loss,  it later became public that the DOD could not account for $2.3 trillion  dollars, amounting to over 25% of its assets. The DOD budget is $480  billion a year, more than all the non-American military spending in the  world combined, yet they managed to lose trillions.</p>
<p>The financial data processing for the US government accounting  systems is performed by DynCorp and Lockheed-Martin. DynCorp was given a  $322 million contract to develop, produce, test, and store FDA licensed  vaccines for the DOD. DynCorp owns the former Blackwater renamed Xe,  renamed Academi, the company that employs the majority of the tens of  thousands of security contractors in Iraq. <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2011/01/27/939249/-DynCorp-and-Blackwater-Now-Owned-by-Private-Equity-Firms-Financed-by-TBTFs#">(Source)</a></p>
<p>DynCorp has also been brought up in front of Congress, along with  Dick Cheney’s old company, Halliburton, for their alleged roles in <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2012/11/child-sex-rings-reveal-worst-of-power.html" target="_blank"> international sex slave rings</a>.</p>

On March 11th 2005, McKinney grilled Secretary Rumsfeld and General Myers on the Dyncorp scandal. </p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>
Mr. Secretary, I watched President Bush deliver a moving speech at  the United Nations in September 2003, in which he mentioned the crisis  of the sex trade. The President called for the punishment of those  involved in this horrible business. But at the very moment of that  speech, DynCorp was exposed for having been involved in the buying and  selling of young women and children. While all of this was going on,  DynCorp kept the Pentagon contract to administer the smallpox and  anthrax vaccines, and is now working on a plague vaccine through the  Joint Vaccine Acquisition Program. Mr. Secretary, is it [the] policy of  the U.S. Government to reward companies that traffic in women and little  girls?</p>

<b>The response and McKinney’s comeback was as follows:</b>  <b> </b></p>

They’re generally not barred in perpetuity.”<b> </b>  <b> </b></p>
<p><b>McKinney:</b> “This contract – this company – was never in the penalty box.”<b> </b></p>
<p><b>Rumsfeld:</b> “I’m advised by DR.  Chu that it was not the corporation that was engaged in the activities  you characterized but I’m told it was an employee of the corporation,  and it was some years ago in the Balkans that that took place.”  Rumsfeld’s effort to shift the blame away from  the hierarchy at Dyncorp and onto the Dyncorp employees was a blatant  attempt to hide the fact that human trafficking and sex slavery is a  practice condoned by companies like DynCorp and Halliburton subsidiaries  like KBR.  What else are we to assume in light of recent  revelations that Halliburton subsidiary KBR and DynCorp lobbyists are  working in tandem with the Pentagon to stall legislation that would  specifically ban trafficking in humans for forced labor and prostitution  by U.S. contractors?</p>

<b>“The elderly are useless eaters” Dr. Henry Kissinger from the book, <i>The Final Days</i>.</b>  Cerberus Capital Management is extremely well-connected to the  Federal Government and the military industrial complex and also is in  close contact with a guy named Henry. Henry has been around so long  that hopefully soon we can say “so long” to Dr. Henry and his decades of  engineered regime change and global overthrows as chronicled so well in  Stephen Kinzer’s book <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/90540.Overthrow">Overthrow.</a>  Back in the days when was the National Security Advisor and  Secretary of State to the Chief of Crooks in the White House, Dick  Nixon, he authored a study, “NSSM 200”, which examined global critical  food supply to overpopulation projections. The Schiller Institute in  December of 1995 summarized his report to President Nixon:</div>
</div>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>
On Dec. 10, 1974, the U.S. National Security Council under Henry Kissinger completed a classified 200-page study, “<b>National Security Study Memorandum 200</b>:  Implications of Worldwide Population Growth for U.S. Security and  Overseas Interests.” The study falsely claimed that population growth in  the so-called Lesser Developed Countries (LDCs) was a grave threat to  U.S. national security. Adopted as official policy in November 1975 by  President Gerald Ford, NSSM 200 outlined a covert plan to reduce  population growth in those countries through birth control, and also,  implicitly, war and famine. Brent Scowcroft, who had by then replaced  Kissinger as national security adviser (the same post Scowcroft was to  hold in the Bush administration), was put in charge of implementing the  plan. CIA Director George Bush was ordered to assist Scowcroft, as were  the secretaries of state, treasury, defense, and agriculture. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>
There were several measures that Kissinger advocated to deal with  this alleged threat, most prominently, birth control and related  population-reduction programs. He also warned that “population growth  rates are likely to increase appreciably before they begin to decline,”  even if such measures were adopted. </p>

Since population  growth is a major determinant of increases in food demand, allocation  of scarce PL 480 resources should take account of what steps a country  is taking in population control as well as food production.

Kissinger also predicted a return of famines that could make  exclusive reliance on birth control programs unnecessary. “Rapid  population growth and lagging food production in developing countries,  together with the sharp deterioration in the global food situation in  1972 and 1973, have raised serious concerns about the ability of the  world to feed itself adequately over the next quarter of century and  beyond,” he reported.  <a href="http://www.schillerinstitute.org/food_for_peace/kiss_nssm_jb_1995.html">(Source)</a></p>

From its headquarters on Park Avenue in Midtown Manhattan, Cerberus  has assembled a remarkable arsenal. It began with Bushmaster, which  until recently was based here in Maine. Unlike military counterparts  like automatic M-16’s, rifles like those from Bushmaster don’t spray  bullets with one trigger pull. But, with gas-powered mechanisms,  semiautomatic can fire rapid follow-up shots as fast as the trigger can  be squeezed. They are often called “black guns” because of their color.  The police tied a Bushmaster XM15 rifle to shootings in the Washington  sniper case in 2002. </p>

<p>Additionally, in 2013, Connecticut became the first state in America  that has made it a felony this year if gun owners do not register their  guns.  The law has been characterized as one of the most restrictive in the  nation.  It bans over 100 firearm models outright, bans magazines that  hold more than 10 rounds, bans certain bullets, and expands the  definition of “assault weapons.”  It also prohibits private sales of  guns without reporting to the government and creates a database of  people denied their rights without due process (medical reasons).  While exempting government agents from the restrictions, it increases  the penalties for anyone who breaks these onerous requirements.  It  also places these individuals into a “deadly weapon offender registry”  for life as they suffer as lifelong felons. The state also dedicated $1  million for statewide firearms trafficking task force.</p>
<p>Connecting the dots we see the guardian of the Gates of Hades,  Cerberus Capital Management, having acquired significant controlling  interest in the nation’s food and personal protection. Combined with  California’s historical “no mas agua”, should civil unrest begin in  earnest this summer or beyond, they will also have a controlling  interest in who gets fed and who does not.</p>
<p>In addition, they also control a large part of who get guns, ammo and personal protection in the near and distant future.  And I hope the irony is not lost on anyone that still, the single  largest investor in Cerberus and its massive gun business, is the  California Teachers Retirement Pension Fund.</p>

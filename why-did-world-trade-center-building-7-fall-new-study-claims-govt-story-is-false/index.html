<h5>A two-year study has determined the collapse of World Trade Center 7 on September 11, 2001 could not have been caused by office fires. This undermines a critical component of the “official story,” but in the age of President Trump will the painstaking investigation make a difference?</h5>
<p><strong>(<a href="http://www.mintpressnews.com/world-trade-center-building-7-fall-new-study-claims-govt-story-false/231780/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MPN</a>)</strong> — Last Wednesday, Dr. J. Leroy Hulsey of the University of Alaska Fairbanks presented the findings and conclusion of his team’s two-year engineering study evaluating whether fire caused the collapse of World Trade Center 7 on September 11, 2001.</p>
<p>Many “9/11 Truth” researchers focus on the mysterious collapse of World Trade Center 7 (WTC7) as the smoking gun evidence that Americans were lied to about the attacks. WTC7 was not hit by a plane, yet it collapsed at 5:20 p.m. on Sept. 11, 2001. According to the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the collapse was caused by office fires leading to thermal expansion of the building’s supportive columns and girders.</p>
<p>Dr. Hulsey’s presentation, “A Structural Reevaluation of the Collapse of World Trade Center 7, September 2017 Progress Report”, detailed how his team eliminated fire as the cause of the collapse of the 47-story building. Hulsey explained that NIST’s report on the collapse found fires on floors 7 through 9, 11 through 14, 19, 22, 29, and 30. However, there is no evidence of fire below floor 7, Hulsey said.</p>

<p>“You have to ask yourself lots of questions … Where is the combustibility in this building? … Did WTC7 collapse because of fires?” Hulsey asked during his presentation. “Our study shows that it did not collapse because of fires.” This revelation matches what Hulsey told MintPress News in September 2016, when his team’s preliminary finding was “that fire did not produce the failure at this particular building,” adding “additional calculations are further substantiating the finding.”</p>
<p>Dr. Hulsey and his team developed an AutoCAD drawing that they then used to create a virtual geography of the building. The research team first partnered with the non-profit <a href="http://www.ae911truth.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth</a> in May of 2015 to study of the collapse of WTC7. They did not release their final report in April 2017 as originally planned, but Hulsey said a draft report of the study will be released in October or November 2017 and will be open for public comment for a six-week period. “I am still examining the progressive collapse. We thought we would be complete by the time announced but it is taking longer than I expected,” Hulsey told MintPress. “I simply am not going to release it until I am sure we are totally correct.”</p>
<p>A final report will be published in early 2018 and submitted to peer-reviewed journals. “It is my plan to provide the opportunity for public and technical input, a form of review and peer review,” Dr. Hulsey stated. “I will have it reviewed during this time frame. Once we have gone through that preliminary review; I will submit the findings to peer-reviewed journals for publication.”</p>
<h5><b>The Bobby McIlvaine Act</b></h5>
<p>Today, on the 16th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, <a href="http://www.ae911truth.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Architects &amp; Engineers for 9/11 Truth</a>, the organization funding Hulsey’s study, held a press conference discussing the conclusions of the study and the introduction of the “Bobby McIlvaine World Trade Center Investigation Act.” The Bobby McIlvaine Act is draft legislation that would impanel a select committee in either chamber of Congress to reinvestigate the destruction of the three World Trade Center towers on September 11, 2001. The act is named after <a href="http://www.montgomerynews.com/amblergazette/news/upper-dublin-remembers-victim-bobby-mcilvaine/article_700358c1-5195-5ea6-a88f-37f0f6b023e5.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bobby McIlvaine</a>, who was tragically killed at the age of 26 while entering the North Tower of the World Trade Center.</p>
<p>Richard Gage, the founder of Architects &amp; Engineers for 9/11 Truth, spoke today about the Bobby McIlvaine Act at the National Press Club in Washington. “The Bobby McIlvaine Act will, for the first time, put in Congress’ hands the resolution which will cause an investigation of the three World Trade Center skyscrapers’ destruction,” Gage told Mint Press. “We are putting Congress on notice and hopefully this act will be successfully legislated into law.”</p>
<p>Following the press conference, Mr. Gage and Bob McIlvaine, Bobby McIlvaine’s father, began the process of distributing informational packets related to the Bobby McIlvaine Act to every member of Congress. The next stage in their campaign will involve attempting to organize a bipartisan group of sponsors to introduce the resolution by September 11, 2018. Mr. McIlvaine has been independently investigating the 9/11 attacks since his son’s death and calling attention to what he says are discrepancies in the government’s narrative of the events of that day. McIlvaine has been an outspoken leader in the so-called “9/11 Truth” movement, advocating for a new investigation since the release of the 9/11 Commission Report in 2004.</p>
<p>The 9/11 Truth movement includes victims, their families, and experts in a range of fields who are skeptical of the government’s official line on 9/11. Some of the groups include <a href="http://www.ae911truth.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Architects &amp; Engineers for 9/11 Truth</a>,<a href="http://ff911truthandunity.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Firefighters for 9/11 Truth &amp; Unity,</a><a href="http://pilotsfor911truth.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Pilots for 9/11 Truth</a>,<a href="http://theantimedia.org/congress-is-finally-pushing-for-911-truth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 9/11 Families United for Justice Against Terrorism,</a><a href="http://stj911.org/members/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Scholars for 9/11 Truth &amp; Justice</a>, and other local activist groups and individuals from around the globe. It’s a loose-knit movement without an official position, and the opinions, theories and ideas held among its members sometimes conflict with one another. However, those working within the broader movement are bound by the belief that the official narrative promoted by the U.S. government is full of holes.</p>
<h5><b>9/11 Truth in the Donald Trump era</b></h5>
<p>The election of Donald Trump brought fear and paranoia to some of the American population, and hope and elation to another segment of the nation. Elements of the 9/11 Truth movement believed Trump might support their cause for a new investigation.  Although Trump never officially discussed his interest in a new investigation into the events of September 11, 2001, he did make vague references to the “secret papers” and to the Saudi government’s possible role in funding the 9/11 attacks. During a campaign event Trump <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-7bxI_XOoQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">called out former president George W. Bush</a> for the Iraq war and referenced “very secret” papers involving the Saudi government and 9/11, elaborating:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It wasn’t the Iraqis that knocked down the World Trade Center; we went after Iraq, we decimated the country. Iran’s taking over, okay. But it wasn’t the Iraqis, you will find out who really knocked down the World Trade Center, ‘cause they have papers in there that are very secret, you may find it’s the Saudis, okay? But you will find out.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The “secret papers” Trump referred to are the now-declassified 28-pages of the “Joint Inquiry into Intelligence Community Activities Before and After the Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001.”  Although<a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/search/pagedetails.action?browsePath=107/HRPT/%5B700%3B799%5D&amp;granuleId=CRPT-107hrpt792&amp;packageId=CRPT-107hrpt792" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> the final report</a> amounts to over 800 pages, the 28 pages were classified by former President George W. Bush shortly after the report was released in 2002. The papers detail the story of Saudi nationals suspected of being Saudi intelligence agents involved in the terror attacks. In July 2016, after nearly 15 years of secrecy and resistance from the Bush and Obama administrations, the report was released to the public and the family members of the victims of the 9/11 terror attacks.</p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>While campaigning for the presidency, Trump also gave an interview on Fox News’ “<a href="https://twitter.com/foxandfriends/status/722385224772890624" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fox &amp; Friends</a>,” stating that the release of the pages would be “very profound” and relate to Saudi Arabia’s role in the 9/11 attacks.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>— FOX &amp; friends (@foxandfriends) <a href="https://twitter.com/foxandfriends/status/722385224772890624">April 19, 2016</a></p>

<p>“That’s very serious stuff,” Trump said. “It’s sort of nice to know who your friends are and perhaps who your enemies are. You’re going to see some very revealing things released in those papers.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Trump also flirted with the 9/11 Truth movement when he criticized former President Obama for his veto of the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, or JASTA, which unanimously passed the House and the Senate in 2016 after a hard-fought battle by the families of the victims of 9/11. The law, passed over Obama’s veto, has now opened the door for lawsuits from the victims of 9/11 and their families against Saudi Arabia to inspect the Kingdom’s possible role in 9/11. Trump called Obama’s veto “shameful” and  “one of the low points of his presidency.”</p>
<p>It is these comments that caused some “9/11 truthers” — including some family members of 9/11 victims — to believe a Donald Trump presidency might lead to a new investigation into the terror attacks. The 9/11 Families and Survivors United for Justice Against Terrorism — the organization largely responsible for pushing JASTA — <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2017/03/911-victims-families-warn-trump-about-getting-cozy-with-saudi-royalty.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sent a letter to President Trump</a> asking him to clarify his position on Saudi Arabia and its role in the terror attacks of September 11, 2001. “This letter is inspired by news reports that today you met with Saudi Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman al Saud,” reads the letter from Terry Strada, a widow and the national chair for the 9/11 Families &amp; Survivors. Strada’s letter continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“As you know, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is a defendant in our lawsuit because of the involvement of its agents in supporting the 9/11 hijackers, and for support that flowed to al-Qaeda through institutions the Kingdom established and funded to spread a radical form of Islam that lies at the root of both al-Qaeda and, more recently, ISIS. Despite mounting evidence, the Saudis have refused to accept accountability for their actions and the injury they have caused across the globe.”</p>
</blockquote>

        </a><br />
        </span></p>
<p>Since becoming president, Donald Trump has shown little interest in carrying his “you may find it’s the Saudis” campaign rhetoric any further. Instead, he has signed an arms deals worth more than $100 billion with the Saudi Kingdom and has continued to offer support for their bombing campaign in Yemen. Trump has not taken any steps towards calling for an investigation into the 9/11 attacks or Saudi Arabia’s possible role. He has remained silent on the controversial topic. The upcoming release of Dr. Hulsey’s study on the collapse of World Trade Center 7 may force Trump to publicly address the situation.</p>
<p>Terry Strada, whose husband Tom Strada died in the twin towers, is skeptical of the importance of Dr. Hulsey’s study. “It doesn’t matter to me what happened to Building 7. I know what happened to the Twin Towers and I know how my husband was murdered. I know who worked with al-Qaeda. That’s all I care about,” Mrs. Strada explained to MintPress News via phone. “It’s a very separate incident. I don’t see how anything that happened to Building 7 has to do with the Twin Towers.”</p>
<p>Despite her skepticism towards the study, Strada is still calling on President Trump to address the concerns of the 9/11 families:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We would like to see some action. We would like to sit down and meet with him, have him hear our side. We know he hears it from the Saudi’s all the time. We want our chance.”</p>

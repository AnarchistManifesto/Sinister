<p>Most people would probably laugh at the idea of government mind control programs, but as the declassified CIA documents we’ll examine here make clear, it was (and probably still is) a real thing in which the U.S government took an active interest.</p>
<p>I should warn that the information below is unsettling to say the least. It sheds light on a hypnosis-induced form of mind control that creates assassins and what you might call ‘super spies’ out of ordinary people who have no knowledge of what takes place or what they’re forced to do.</p>
<p>It sheds light on a power in the U.S. government so corrupted and evil that it has no problem tricking people into doing awful things that they would’ve never done or supported in their normal waking state. <a href="http://www.wanttoknow.info/mind_control/cia_mind_control_experiments_sex_abuse">Assassinations, terrorism and ‘sexual favors’</a> are just a few of many things mind-controlled victims are forced to do.</p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>Like other websites that share this information, I’d recommend countering it with positive, wholesome information; perhaps related to the evolution of the soul or something similar that can remind you that despite all of the horrific things the government (and the powers behind it) has done, the world is still a good place.</p>
<p>You might not think so after reading some of these documents, but the sooner we can expose all of this, the sooner we can bring justice to those responsible and create a better world that works for the people in every way.</p>
<p>I’ve decided to copy the declassified CIA documents directly from <a href="http://www.wanttoknow.info/mind_control/cia_mind_control_experiments_sex_abuse">WantToKnow.info</a> instead of paraphrasing them so they sink in. Here’s some information from Want to Know about these documents and the continuation of the programs they discuss:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Though dating from the 1950s and 60s, these revealing documents were not released for decades for reasons of ‘national security.’</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/spybook.html" rel="nofollow"><img class="alignright" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-2rpIvrXg-Fs/VmRkxPD3g7I/AAAAAAAACIs/nnxWnXNPAKU/s250-Ic42/LFL_SPY_WillLetOnAirplanes_250x250.jpg" alt=""></a>“The U.S. government claims mind control experiments are no longer being carried out, yet how can we know? The existence of these programs was denied for decades, and certainly any recent documents would be classified secret under the rubric of ‘national security.’”</p>
<p>“A trusted CIA informant I know assures me that these programs are ongoing. These disturbing methods are used by various countries in clandestine operations around the world. Many might prefer not to look at these ugly wounds to the soul of our nation and world. Yet if we avoid or ignore them, they are likely to grow and fester.</p>
<p>“<strong>Only by having the courage to look into the shadow parts of our world can we first understand and then work to stop the hidden manipulations and begin to heal these wounds.</strong>” (1)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first document outlines the success of controlling the minds of young women who volunteered for the experiment (not knowing what they got themselves into). They were successfully instructed to relay information and carry out other tasks in an unconscious state.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>CIA document and page number: 190684, pp. 1, 4<br />
Title: <strong>Outline of Special H Cases</strong><br />
Date: 7 January 1953<br />
</em><a href="http://www.wanttoknow.info/mind_control/foia_mind_control/190684.1_hypnosis_mind_control_girls"><em>Page 1</em></a><em>, </em><a href="http://www.wanttoknow.info/mind_control/foia_mind_control/190684.4_hypnosis_mind_control_girls"><em>Page 4</em></a></p>
<p>“In a general request for volunteers [deleted names] volunteered for H [hypnosis] experimentation and were originally tested on 21 May 1951. <strong>Both girls, at this time, were nineteen years of age. </strong></p>
<p><strong>“</strong>These subjects have clearly demonstrated that they can pass from a fully awake state to a deep H controlled state via the telephone, via some very subtle signal that cannot be detected by other persons in the room, and without the other individuals being able to note the change.</p>
<p>“It has been shown clearly that physically individuals can be induced into H by telephone, by receiving written matter, or by the use of code, signal, or words. <strong>Control of those hypnotized can be passed from one individual to another without great difficulty. </strong></p>
<p>“<strong>It has also been shown by experimentation with these girls that they can act as unwilling couriers for information purposes</strong>, and that they can be conditioned to a point where they believe a change in identity on their part even on the polygraph.” (2)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We learn here that there are various ways hypnosis can be induced; via telephone, a certain code or even a certain word. If this doesn’t make it clear that words have a power most people are unaware of, then I don’t know what does.</p>
<p>Admittedly, the power of words isn’t as important here as the fact that they were being used to induce hypnosis and manipulate these young women to do things against their will, as the note under this document snippet from Want to Know explains.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<strong>Want to Know Note: </strong>This document shows that CIA experimenters were successful in hypnotizing young women (19 years old in this case) to do things they would not do normally without any memory afterward, sometimes even unwillingly.</p>
<p>“Though they volunteered, these women were thus programmed to be Manchurian Candidates or super spies with no knowledge of what these men were doing to them.” (3)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/brain101.html" target="_blank"><img class="alignright" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-b2KBJy3pxwc/VF71B58k12I/AAAAAAAAAKQ/nJtcZhqJ1jw/s220/220_006.png" alt=""></a>Before sharing this next snippet, I should note that various forms of abuse are used in mind control programs to fracture the mind and create multiple personalities.</p>
<p>The ‘new’ entering personality carries out assassinations, sexual acts, etc., and the snippet below outlines how electroshock is used to ‘modify attitudes’ so these malevolent acts can be performed by unwitting suspects.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>CIA document and page number: 17395, p. 18<br />
Title: <strong>ESP Research</strong><br />
Date: Unknown<br />
Link to view image of original: </em><a href="http://www.wanttoknow.info/mind_control/foia_mind_control/17395_drugs_electric_shock_mind_control"><em>Click here</em></a></p>
<p>“Learning models will be instituted in which the subject will be rewarded or punished for his overall performance and reinforced in various ways – by being told whether he was right, by being told what the target was, <strong>with electric shock</strong> etc. … <strong>In other cases drugs and psychological tricks will be used to modify his attitudes.</strong></p>
<p>“The experimenters will be particularly interested in disassociative states, from the <a href="http://www.nyaap.org/index.php/id/7/subid/44">abaissement de niveau</a> mental to multiple personality in so-called mediums, and an attempt will be made to induce a number of states of this kind, using hypnosis.</p>
<p><strong>Want to Know Note:</strong> “This document provides proof that the CIA was using drugs and electric shock in attempting to induce MPD (multiple personality disorder). Though this document uses the masculine ‘he’ to describe the subject, other documents show that most of the subjects used were young women who volunteered.</p>
<p><strong>“</strong>The subjects were not informed about the deeper aspects and implications for which they were being trained. If you view the original [document], you will also find interesting information on ESP experiments.” (4)</p>
</blockquote>

This is a blatant violation of their freewill, and you don’t need insider testimony to know that the same things are happening today (or worse).</p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>These documents come from the ’50s and ’60s; can you imagine how much progress they’ve made in inducing multiple personalities through abuse, trauma and certain words or signals since then?</p>
<p>In a disturbing document, we learn how mind controlled ‘super spies’ were trained to kill against their will. The test subject in this case was afraid of guns and totally unwilling to pick one up in her normal waking state, but in her hypnotized state she was perfectly capable of picking it up and firing.</p>

Title: <strong>Hypnotic Experimentation and Research </strong><br />
Date: 10 February 1954<br />

<p>“A posthypnotic of the night before (pointed finger, you will sleep) was enacted. Misses [deleted] and [deleted] immediately progressed to a deep hypnotic state with no further suggestion.</p>
<p><strong>“Miss [deleted] was then instructed (having previously expressed a fear of firearms in any fashion) that she would use every method at her disposal to awaken miss [deleted] (now in a deep hypnotic sleep), and failing this, she would pick up a pistol nearby and fire it at Miss [deleted]. </strong></p>
<p>“<strong>She was instructed that her rage would be so great that she would not hesitate to ‘kill’ [deleted] for failing to awaken.</strong></p>
<p>“Miss [deleted] carried out these suggestions to the letter including firing the (unloaded pneumatic pistol) gun at [deleted] and then proceeding to fall into a deep sleep. After proper suggestions were made, both were awakened and expressed complete amnesia for the entire sequence.</p>
<p>“Miss [deleted] was again handed the gun, which she refused (in an awakened state) to pick up or accept from the operator. <strong>She expressed absolute denial that the foregoing sequence had happened</strong>.” (5)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The young woman given the gun then expressed her reluctance to continue the experiment. In response, those overseeing the experiment lulled her back into a hypnotic, submissive state and continued on. They wrote that she would improve with proper training.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<strong>Miss [deleted] felt reluctant about participating further</strong> since she expressed her doubt as to any useful purpose in further attendance. The Operator thereupon proceeded in full view of all other subjects to explain to Miss [deleted] that he planned to induce a deep state of hypnosis <u>now</u>. The reaction was as had been expected.</p>
<p>“Miss [deleted] excused herself to make a telephone call (defense mechanism?). Upon her return a very positive approach was adopted by the operator whereupon a deeper, much deeper state of hypnosis was obtained.</p>
<p>“Immediately a posthypnotic was induced that when the operator accidentally dropped a steel ball in his hand to the floor … Miss [deleted] would again go into hypnosis. Miss [deleted] then advised that she must conclude her work for the evening.</p>
<p>“She arose to adjust her hair before the mirror. The ball was dropped and she promptly slumped back into the chair and back into hypnosis. It is the opinion of the operator the Miss [deleted] if properly trained (positive approach) will continue to improve.” (6)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As Want to Know points out, this became less of a volunteered role and more of a role forced onto the test subjects, as outlined by the fact that the young woman who wanted to leave was hypnotized and forced to continue.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Want to Know <strong>Note:</strong></strong> “Here we have proof that these women could be converted into unsuspecting and even unwilling assassins. They could be programmed to assassinate anyone and would do so without any conscious knowledge afterward.</p>
<p><strong>“</strong>Note also the questionable status of ‘volunteer’ implied. Though these women originally volunteered, unwillingness to continue could be manipulated by the men running the program.” (7)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The next document is long, so I’ll break it up into segments. It describes the process of hypnotizing two young women, instructing one to receive a bomb and learn how to activate it and the other to give the bomb and the instructions how to activate it. This is, of course, not something either woman would ever ordinarily do.</p>

Title: <strong>SI and H Experimentation </strong><br />

Note: SI stands for sleep induction and H for hypnosis </em></p>
<p>“Prior to actually beginning the more complex experiments, several simple post H were worked with both of the girls participating.</p>
<p>“The first major experiment of the evening was set up as follows without previous explanation to either [deleted] or [deleted]. Both subjects were placed in a very deep trance state and while in this state, the following instructions were given:</p>
<p>(A) “[Deleted] was instructed that when she awakened, she was to procede to [deleted] room. She was told that while there, she would receive a telephone call from an individual whom she would know only as ‘Joe’.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/unexplainablefrequencies.html" rel="nofollow"><img class="alignright" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-IxbGiBSsnzg/UDUKGoSAGMI/AAAAAAAARfM/QsLujOF3pGM/s200/aa200block.gif" alt=""></a>“This individual would engage her in a normal telephone conversation. <strong>During this conversation, this individual would give her a code word and upon mentioning the code word, [deleted] would go into a deep SI [sleep induction] trance state, but would be ‘normal’ in appearance with her eyes open.</strong></p>
<p>“[Deleted] was then told that upon the conclusion of the telephone conversation, she would procede to the ladies room where she would meet a girl who was unknown to her.</p>
<p>“She was told that she would strike up a conversation with this girl and during the conversation she would mention the code word ‘New York’ to this other girl, who, in turn, would give her a device and further instructions which were to be carried out by [deleted].</p>
<p>“She was told that after she carried out the instructions, she was to return to the Operations Room, sit in the sofa and go immediately into a deep sleep.” (8)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The document then outlines the instructions given to the girl in possession of the bomb.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“[Deleted] was instructed that upon awakening, she would proceed to [deleted] room where she would wait at the desk for a telephone call. Upon receiving the call, a person known as ‘Jim’ would engage her in normal conversation.</p>
<p>“During the course of the conversation, this individual would mention a code word to [deleted]. When she heard this code word, she would pass into a SI trance state, but would not close her eyes and remain perfectly normal and continue the telephone conversation.</p>
<p>“She was told that upon conclusion of the telephone conversation, she would then carry out the following instructions:</p>
<p>“[Deleted] being in a complete SI state at this time, was then told to open her eyes and was shown an electric timing device. <strong>She was informed that this timing device was an incendiary bomb and was then instructed how to attach and set the device.</strong></p>
<p>“After [deleted] had indicated that she had learned how to set and attach the device, she was told to return to a sleep state and further instructed that upon concluding the aforementioned conversation, she would take the timing device which was in a briefcase and proceed to the ladies room.</p>
<p>“In the ladies room, she would be met by a girl whom she had never seen who would identify herself by the code word ‘New York.’</p>
<p>“<strong>[Deleted] was then to show this individual how to attach and set the timing device and further instructions would be given the individual by [deleted] that the timing device was to be carried in the briefcase to [deleted] room, placed in the nearest empty electric-light plug and concealed in the bottom, left-hand drawer of [deleted] desk, with the device set for 82 seconds and turned on.</strong>” (9)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both of the girls were instructed to return to their rooms and go into a ‘deep sleep’ when they completed their tasks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“[Deleted] was further instructed to tell this other girl that as soon as the device had been set and turned on, she was to take the briefcase, leave [deleted] room, go to the operations room and go to the sofa and enter a deep sleep state.</p>
<p>“[Deleted] was further instructed that after completion of instructing the other girl and the transferring to the other girl of the incendiary bomb, she was to return at once to the operations room, sit on the sofa, and go into a deep sleep state.” (10)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The plan had to be changed a little, but overall, the women did exactly what they were instructed to do with no difficulty.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“For a matter of record, immediately after the operation was begun it was noted that a member of the charforce was cleaning the floor in the ladies room and subsequently, both [deleted] and [deleted] had to be placed … once again in a trance state and instructions changed from the ladies room to Room 3.</p>

<p>“It should be noted that even with the change of locale in the transfer point, the experiment was carried off perfectly without any difficulty or hesitation on the part of either of the girls.</p>
<p>“Each girl acted out their part perfectly, the device was planted and set as directed and both girls returned to the operations room, sat on the sofa and entered a deep sleep state. Throughout, their movements were easy and natural.” (11)</p>
<p>Want to Know poses an important question: If these young women could be instructed to do just about anything in an unconscious state, could they not be taken advantage of sexually?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<strong>Want to Know</strong> <strong>Note:</strong> You will note the frequent use of ‘girls’ (young women) in these programs. Do you think the men in charge, having complete hypnotic control of these women, might have at times taken advantage of them sexually? Yet this would never enter the official documentation, with the one major exception below.” (12)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, the answer is yes; this has happened and the document below proves it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“CIA document and page number: 140393, p. 1<br />
Title: <strong>[Deleted] </strong><br />
Date: 9 July 1951<br />
Link to view image of original: </em><a href="http://www.wanttoknow.info/mind_control/foia_mind_control/cia_sexual_abuse_mind_control"><em>Click here</em></a></p>
<p>“On 2 July 1951 approximately 1:00 p.m. the instruction began with [deleted] relating to the student some of his sexual experiences. <strong>[Deleted] stated that he had constantly used hypnotism as a means of inducing young girls to engage in sexual intercourse with him.</strong></p>
<p>“[Deleted], a performer in [deleted] orchestra, was forced to engage in sexual intercourse with [deleted] while under the influence of hypnotism. [Deleted] stated that he first put her into a hypnotic trance and then suggested to her that he was her husband and that she desired sexual intercourse with him.</p>
<p><strong>Want to Know Note:</strong> “This document shows that an instructor being used by the CIA took advantage of his skill in hypnosis to sexually abuse young women without their having any knowledge of being abused. How many CIA hypnotists did likewise?</p>
<p><strong>“Do you think a man involved in these programs might take advantage of a beautiful, young woman knowing she would not remember afterward?</strong></p>
<p>“Note that for some reason this document is not available in the CIA’s three CD set and must be ordered individually at <a href="http://www.foia.cia.gov/foia_request">this link</a>. See the <a href="http://www.wanttoknow.info/mind_control/cia_mind_control_experiments_sex_abuse#sum">What You Can Do</a> section … for suggestions on how we can stop this abuse.” (13)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed by all of this information. It might make you question how there can be such a level of evil lurking within institutions that seem to control everything, and the more you think about it, the more obvious it will become. Then, you might wonder how the masses let it get this way.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/manifestation.html" target="_blank"><img class="noshadow alignright" style="background: none;border: none" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-kG5Z9E_CZR0/VQ2qDlx8dOI/AAAAAAAABfU/VuU2abmOzuU/s257/Manifestation-Ebook2.png" alt=""></a>Unfortunately, it’s here and it isn’t going anywhere unless we stand up to it. It’s maintained through secrecy, and while most of us are generally aware that the government, big banks and other large corporations work against us (while surviving off of what we give them), we have no idea how deep the rabbit hole goes.</p>
<p>I’m sure mind control is only the tip of the iceberg, and these documents shed light on something we already know; the powers that be, which would rather control us and use us for war than help us prosper, are not our friends.</p>
<p>They have no interest in helping the world, and they use us in secretive and sometime horrific ways to get what they want. They thrive from our ignorance and unwillingness to talk about any of this, because we allow what they’re doing to continue by turning a blind eye.</p>
<p>I know this stuff is hard to read and it’s not as fun to think about as spirituality, higher dimensions or the evolution of the soul, but we have to accept this reality before we can change it to match the vision in our minds and hearts.</p>
<p>I have the same utopian vision of a planet free from social, environmental and spiritual pollution as many in the conscious community, but we have to focus on what needs to change before we can make the vision come true.</p>
<p><strong>We can make the vision of an enlightened new age in human history a reality, but we have to be real about what’s preventing it and work as actively to stop all of it as we do to evolve spiritually. </strong></p>
<p>We can’t focus on enlightenment or utopia while darkness and suffering thrive, and we have to expose and get rid of the bad before we can enjoy the good. We can only spread the light by diving headfirst into the darkness and reaching out a hand for those who are lost.</p>
<p>There are about six more documents I didn’t include in this report, and if you’re interested in educating yourself and raising awareness, I recommend reading the rest of them at Want to Know (link below in footnotes). As long as you can handle an uncomfortable truth, you can bring awareness to it and inspire revolution.</p>
<p>If we don’t do it, nobody will. Too many people are unwilling to explore topics that take them out of their comfort zone, but in this case, complacency will cause our demise whereas education and enlightenment will liberate us (and the planet) from mind control and certain destruction.</p>

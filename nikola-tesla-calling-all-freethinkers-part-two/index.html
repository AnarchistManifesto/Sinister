<p>Had humanity been allowed to pursue Nikola Tesla’s Aether technology as Tesla envisioned, we might not be on the brink of martial law in America, and WWIII wouldn’t be breathing down our necks. The Power Status Quo (PSQ) are very heavy breathers with death on their breath.</p>
<p>Speaking of breath…President Woodrow Wilson surely spoke under his breath when he talked about the tiny elite club that dominates humanity—or as Wilson called them in the following quote, the “power somewhere”:</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>
Since I entered politics, I have chiefly had men’s views confided to me privately. Some of the biggest men in the U.S., in the field of commerce and manufacturing, are afraid of somebody, are afraid of something. They know that there is a power somewhere so organized, so subtle, so watchful, so interlocked, so complete, so pervasive, that they had better not speak above their breath when they speak in condemnation of it. [<a href="http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson">1</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s them, the PSQ, Wilson’s “…power somewhere so organized, so subtle, so watchful, so interlocked, so complete, so pervasive….” Apparently, for any PSQ member, sanctity and preservation of their power is all that matters. Anything threatening the PSQ’s power is an enemy; Tesla still epitomizes threat to the PSQ seventy years after he was eliminated, physically.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>The way a nation treats its freethinkers is a reliable portrayal of the nation’s future. And the way a nation’s elite respond to geniuses like Nikola Tesla, independent inventors who put humanity and nature above profit—that’s the ultimate portent of whether a nation grows toward freedom, or tyranny…toward the stars, or underground. The PSQ’s reaction to Tesla seems a guarantee of Orwellian nightmares. 1984 might be in the rearview mirror, but “The Party’s” (PSQ’s) war on independent thought remains in the headlights.</p>
<p>Globalist New-World-Order tyranny aims to smother rich diversity of Earth’s almost two hundred “sovereign nations” with a single world blanket sopping with inhumanity. Tesla showed us how humanity might go the other way by giving us the key to unlocking the PSQ’s prison doors; ever since the PSQ have tried to sepulcher the key in a psychopathic force field. But no matter how many Einsteinian and Michelson-Morley [<a href="http://www.cellularuniverse.org/AA2MM_Aether.htm">2</a>] kinds of charades they play, the PSQ will never smother the Aether—except for “officially”.</p>
<div align="center">
<p>    <ins class="adsbygoogle" style="height: 90px;width: 728px"></ins></p>
<p>    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || ).push({});</p>
</div>
<p>
Disinformation and misinformation about Tesla can seem limitless. Rarely is truth mingled with things people hear about Tesla, especially when it comes to his masterpiece—that competition the PSQ can’t bury, buy out, monopolize or destroy.</p>
<p>Tesla is celebrated for invention of, or fundamental contributions to: lasers and other phenomena of light; robotics; radio; X-rays; remote control; polyphase alternating current (AC) and induction motors and more…. Topping the popular list are Tesla’s more than forty patents covering the entire system of “polyphase” AC that powers civilization. But Tesla’s masterpiece remains forbidden technology, at least publicly (black-ops taxpayer black holes are invisible beneath the event horizon). Tesla’s Aether technology and broadcast electricity remain among the PSQ’s mortal enemies, and their flair for disinformation approaches zenith in what they have done to <b>“Tesla’s Coil”</b> (not to be confused with the “Tesla Coil”).</p>
<p><b>The AC Albatross Around Tesla’s Neck</b></p>
<div>
The PSQ will not let Tesla’s AC wizardry wash off; it’s a virtual tattoo that helps the PSQ con the public into believing that “Tesla’s Coil” is simply a high-frequency AC toy for making bitchin’ sparks. The PSQ’s lap dog, Wikipedia, claims: “Today their main use is for entertainment and educational displays.” For the “Tesla Coil”, the PSQ’s impostor, that statement is true, same as Wikipedia’s, “It is used to produce high-voltage, low-current, high frequency alternating-current electricity.” Problem is, that is precisely what “Tesla’s Coil” is NOT used for. Any time you read the term “current”, or “high frequency alternating current” or anything involving flow of electrons, you are not reading about <b>“Tesla’s Coil”</b>, a zero-current invention, but its neutered caricature, the “Tesla Coil”. Tesla’s decoupling of voltage and current with “Tesla’s Coil”… isolation of pure voltage from flow of electrons—that’s Tesla magic.</div>
</p>
<div>
<a href="http://activistpost.net/teslasecret/" rel="nofollow" style="float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" class="noshadow" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/_qLAIskTQXUc/TaqAcrCPlhI/AAAAAAAAISQ/5uq527jnmDM/book-shape.jpg" style="border: none"></a>Tesla strived to eliminate sparks from “Tesla’s Coil”. Sparks are lossy instabilities that impede distant broadcast effects, keeping a “Tesla’s Coil” from being a true Tesla Transmitter.</p>
<p>The PSQ jumped all over sparks, corrupting the “Tesla Coil” into a generator of exactly what Tesla sought to eliminate from <b>“Tesla’s Coil”</b>. They also abuse the term “high frequency”, which in AC terminology means alternations per second. Regarding “Tesla’s Coil”, frequency means impulses per second, something entirely different than alternations. PSQ virtuosity in the Art of Confusion is mind boggling, literally.  </p>
<p>By the latter 1880s, Tesla had essentially abandoned the AC waveform in favor of what he called,  “…the true electricity”. Tesla’s patents exclusively used terminology regarding electrical impulse. He remained free of AC, but “officially”, the AC albatross around Tesla’s neck is permanent.</p>
<p>Transverse electromagnetic waves (AC) [<a href="http://www2.cose.isu.edu/~hackmart/waves100.PDF">3</a>] anchor humanity to tyranny; Tesla’s “non-Hertzian”, longitudinal waves [<a href="http://www.physicsclassroom.com/mmedia/waves/lw.cfm">4</a>] could set humanity free. Why else would the PSQ try so hard to bind Tesla to AC? “Establishment” science also denies Tesla freedom from his AC wizardry. Tesla’s masterpiece is a real pain in the dogma.</p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>Tesla’s introduction to phenomena he dedicated most of the second half of his life to came during his brief employment by Thomas Edison.</p>
<p>Before Tesla’s Polyphase AC replaced Edison’s direct-current (DC) power distribution system, electricity was delivered to consumers by a web of transmission lines infested with “pumping stations” to help keep the current flowing. Another method of fighting transmission-line resistance and forcing current farther than a few city blocks was to crank very high the voltage from generating plants. When switches were thrown, blasting transmission lines with extreme voltage right off the generators, something strange and even deadly happened in the instant before current (electrons) flowed in the lines, something engineers and DC linesmen called “the blue spike phenomena”. Blue and purple spikes accompanied by stinging and shocking pressure sensations radiated from the power lines. Engineers, and especially linesmen who had seen fellow workmen killed by the phenomena, saw the spikes as a problem to be eliminated. Tesla saw amazing elevations of electrostatic potential that were quenched when electrons started flowing—saw a potential new breed of electricity to investigate, perhaps even harness.</p>
<p>So began a love affair between humanity and the Cosmos, wide-open to transcendence, but because of the human element, begging for a villain….</p>
<p>Tesla seduced from the Cosmos innermost electrical secrets, reproducing precursor dynamics of blue spike phenomena by using a dynamo and capacitors to blast a thin wire with high-powered impulses, reproducing the radiant, stinging pressure effect. Tesla discovered the radiance could pass through glass, copper shielding, Faraday cages…there was no way to block what Tesla now believed was purely an electrical effect.</p>
<p>Tesla progressed to using a magnetic spark gap that allowed unidirectional DC impulses of increasing power and much higher impulse frequency…leading to his decoupling of voltage from current. He almost had the Aether in his hands.</p>
<p>The Internet still offers intricate truth about development of “Tesla’s Coil”. For example:  [<a href="http://pesn.com/2011/04/19/9501813_Tesla_Coils_Unleash_Aether/">5</a>] [<a href="http://pesn.com/2012/01/27/9602024_Aether_Flow--The_True_Electric_Current/">6</a>] [<a href="http://customers.hbci.com/~wenonah/new/tesla.htm">7</a>] [<a href="http://fuel-efficient-vehicles.org/energy-news/?page_id=481">8</a>] [<a href="http://johnbedini.net/john34/Radiant1.htm">9</a>].  </p>
<p>In 1892, Tesla published a paper titled: “The Dissipation of Electricity”.</p>
<p>Virtually the entire scientific establishment seemed unable to comprehend Tesla’s breakthrough, blundering into thinking Tesla referred to high-frequency AC (that albatross) in his explanation of what he called his new “transformer” (here called <b>“Tesla’s Coil”</b>). Unlike in a standard transformer, AC electromagnetic field induction was not involved. “Tesla’s Coil” blazed a new domain of physics, accomplishing release of kinetic radiant electricity from the Aether through abrupt discharges of electrostatic potentials.</p>
<p>Tesla’s “dynamic electrostatic forces” violated accepted theories of physics. Establishment “fizzixs” (fi$ixs) [<a href="http://www.infinite-energy.com/iemagazine/issue48/teslaandtheaether.pdf">10</a>] embarked on a heavily-funded and contrived fit, arguing that Tesla’s “effect” was impossible, insisting that he revise his claims.</p>
<p><b>“See The Excitement Coming!”</b></p>
</div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
Tesla said that in completion of  his lecture on: “The Dissipation of Electricity”.</p>
<p>After discovering Radiant Electricity in 1889, Tesla theorized that it was bound up with the Aether. Disruptions in equilibrium of the Aether with instantaneous unidirectional DC pulses could release Radiant Electricity. He spent much of the rest of the 1890s confirming and developing this theory in his New York laboratories, then expanding to Colorado Springs for large-scale experiments. Using his “magnifying transformer” and its 52-foot “Tesla’s Coil” capable of outputting millions of volts, Tesla found he could send pulses of electricity that spanned the planet and reflected back with virtually no loss. In Tesla’s own words:</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>
That communication without wires to any point on the globe is practical with such apparatus would need no demonstration, but through a discovery which I made I obtained absolute certitude. Popularly explained, it is exactly this: When we raise the voice and hear an echo in reply, we know that the sound of the voice must have reached a distant wall, or boundary, and must have been reflected from the same. Exactly as the sound, so an electrical wave is reflected, and the same evidence which is afforded by an echo is offered by an electrical phenomenon known as a ‘stationary’ wave – that is, a wave with fixed nodal and ventral regions. Instead of sending sound vibrations toward a distant wall, I have sent electrical vibrations toward the remote boundaries of the Earth, and instead of the wall the Earth has replied. In place of an echo I have obtained a stationary electrical wave, a wave reflected from afar.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And Tesla wrote:</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>
That electrical energy can be economically transmitted without wires to any terrestrial distance, I have unmistakably established in numerous observations, experiments and measurements, qualitative and quantitative. These have demonstrated that it is practicable to distribute power from a central plant in unlimited amounts, with a loss not exceeding a small fraction of one percent in the transmission, even to the greatest distance, 12,000 miles – to the opposite end of the globe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He was ready to so elegantly make electricity available anywhere on Earth, one needed only to push into the ground a simple resonant receiver. Tesla’s potential masterstroke at Shoreham, Long Island, NY, was perhaps humanity’s most important project of all time….</p>
<p><b>Wardenclyffe</b></p>
</div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
Imagine a human, driven by sheer humanitarian motives (friendship, loyalty, trust, gratitude…), tearing up a contract potentially worth billions of dollars…<i>c’est la vie</i>. Tesla did exactly that—tore up his contract with Westinghouse covering Tesla’s perpetual royalties on power produced at the Niagara Falls generating plant. Tragic consequences for the future of humanity were yet to be understood.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/teslasecrets.html" style="float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img border="0" src="https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/imgad.gif"></a>Today, such humanitarianism would be labeled insanity. The PSQ used it to twist Tesla into everything from a “bad businessman” to a neurotic basket case. Tesla was an “extreme sensitive”, a genius ahead of his time. One man offering humanity such treasures seems unfathomable. Rest assured, the PSQ is right on top of never letting that happen again.</p>
<p>His waiving of royalties to help Westinghouse meant that Tesla would have to stoop to J.P. Morgan for main funding of Wardenclyffe. Re-enter the “villain”of our love story. [<a href="http://arcanumdeepsecrets.wordpress.com/2010/06/12/free-energy-from-tesla%E2%80%99s-wireless-electricity-an-instant-solution-to-the-planetary-energy-%E2%80%98crisis%E2%80%99/">11</a>]</p>
<p>Tesla told Morgan that Wardenclyffe would transmit “intelligence” globally. Morgan allegedly assumed that Tesla was referring to radio transmission.</p>
<p>An interesting aspect about Tesla’s use of the term, “intelligence”…his mass-free “cold electricity” (Aether) from an optimized <b>“Tesla’s Coil”</b> has a room-filling cool-breeze effect accompanied by significant elevation of human consciousness. Mental clarity, concentration, perception and comprehension—human intelligence in general is boosted by concentrated Aether. Among most any government’s greatest fears is higher intelligence among the public, a threat to spare no expense fighting. For example, how would a government with perceptive, intelligent and even free-thinking citizens in crucial numbers…how would a government significantly challenged by an intelligent citizenry ever get away with a 9/11?</p>
<p>Americans confirm rousing success of the federal government’s program of dumbing-down citizens—perhaps the most successful federal program in the history of the republic. It takes a lot of time and money and honey to groom the public into believing authority instead of reality, believing official lies instead of their own eyes.</p>
<p><b>“Tesla’s Coil”</b> was already a mortal threat to the PSQ—enhanced public awareness and intelligence to boot demands SWAT (special weapons and tactics) counterattacks.</p>
<p>The PSQ SWAT teams earn their grub. The “Tesla Coil”—zombie stand-in turning humanity’s crowning technological achievement into a toy for mesmerizing the child in all of us with ever bigger, badder, bitchin’er SPARKS! Now that’s SWAT.</p>
<p>The PSQ is shrewd, clever, conniving, vicious…not dumb, simply lacking humanity. Tesla decoupled voltage from electrons. The PSQ represent humans decoupled from conscience — experts at decoupling humans from science and filling them with mythology….</p>
<p>Construction began at Wardenclyffe in 1901. Morgan anted $150,000 (multiple millions in today’s dollar), 51% of initial funding. Inadequate funding plagued the project. Equipment alone would cost more than $200,000—but at least Wardenclyffe was taking off. Hideously, its flight plan involved a PSQ-greased slide from a pinnacle of human achievement…to what the PSQ’s newspapers would idiotically label, “Tesla’s million-dollar folly”.</p>
<p>In 1902 what was popularly called “Tesla’s Tower” reached its full height of 187 feet. Tesla moved his laboratory operations from Houston Street in NYC, to Wardenclyffe.</p>
<p>On October 14, 1904, Morgan finally responded to Tesla’s scores of unanswered request for more funding by pulling plug on Wardenclyffe. In 1917, US Marines seized “Tesla’s Tower” because of fears that German spies could be lurking around it, and it could possibly be used by German submarines as a landmark. The tower was dynamited, and sold for scrap.</p>
<p>Modern Tesla mythology wallows in Morgan learning halfway through the project of Wardenclyffe’s wireless global transmission of power, then balking over profit concerns.</p>
<p>Was Morgan really that ignorant of Wardenclyffe? Morgan became Rothschild’s main man in America not through ignorance, but awareness and cunning, shrewd psychopathic focus on profit for the boss at whatever cost to humanity.</p>
<p>A more realistic scenario has Morgan decently aware of Wardenclyffe’s purpose. Initial funding was a certain insurance premium on a policy for controlling Tesla. If Tesla was a free spirit with funds for new research, tycoon fortunes from choicest monopolies were not safe. Tesla had rendered the whole DC power distribution system obsolete virtually overnight. What in hell might he discover next? $150,000 plunked down to minimize PSQ exposure to Tesla’s technological and humanitarian mischief, a good policy considering how long Tesla was controlled.</p>
<p>Ill-equipped to understand much truth that might squeak through PSQ defenses, the public was curried into thinking Wardenclyffe was a giant tower for spraying the world with energy. People could see Hollywood all over it: “…the sucker’s gigantic! Good football field tall—and that top thing…like some dinosaur mushroom…or something.” The public might have felt let down if they heard the tower was actually a collector for absorbing Aether and shedding electrons in opposed cycles. Aether flowing down through the tower would be shunted into the station for pulse-rate manipulations in preparation for rebroadcast into the Earth by Tesla’s amazing quarter-wave antenna beneath the tower—an antenna effectively fifty miles long.</p>
<p>Wardenclyffe was so far over most people’s heads that, with the right SWAT, Tesla’s masterstroke would be chained to a legacy of “folly”. At least three years before Wardenclyffe’s tower was demolished, Tesla was already well down the road to being an “unperson”.</p>
<p><b>What Tesla Could’ve Prevented</b></p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>
No matter what we attempt to do, no matter to what fields we turn our efforts, we are dependent on power. We have to evolve means of obtaining energy from stores which are forever inexhaustible, to perfect methods which do not imply consumption and waste of any material whatever. If we use fuel to get our power, we are living on our capital and exhausting it rapidly. This method is barbarous and wantonly wasteful and will have to be stopped in the interest of coming generations. —  Nikola Tesla</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Current increasing awareness of Tesla, while promising, seems largely at the mercy of the PSQ’s obsession with “fixing” the Internet. Information can be very powerful—especially accurate information so important and so suppressed for so long before finally finding the right minds.</p>
<p>The PSQ’s lavish use of SWAT to suppress Tesla is a transparent testament to his genius. A crucial question: Does humanity have the intelligence to realize how much the PSQ’s naked suppression actually honors Tesla’s achievements? As people become more aware that Tesla offers humanity freedom from PSQ tyranny, it seems important to consider: If humanity had embraced Tesla appropriately, he could have saved us from, or at least minimized, many entrenched horrors. Like so many aspects of Tesla, his timing was cosmic. </p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>Nikola Tesla was born on July 10, 1856, in what is now Croatia.</p>
<p>About three years later, August 8, 1859, Colonel Edwin Drake drilled the world’s first successful oil well near Titusville, Pennsylvania.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/stirlinggenerator.html" rel="nofollow" style="float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-J4xHp_BRR6k/UCGNstMMDZI/AAAAAAAARPc/H486-97BsBg/s200/ad2200.jpg"></a>The hydrocarbon age is a catastrophe fouling ever more profoundly the future of life on Earth. The PSQ’s energy monopoly has led to extreme consolidation of wealth into what George Bush the 1st, spokesman extraordinaire for inhumanity, calls, “…higher, tighter and righter hands.” In humanitarian terms, that translates into Satanic hands. Fossil fuels’ empowerment of psychopaths  plagues humanity with perpetual war, genocide, debt slavery, vast poverty, environmental devastation and pillaging of the future. Fossil fuels are essential to the PSQ’s inhuman domination of humanity.</p>
<p>Tesla could cure the cancer of fossil fuels metastasizing through every aspect of life on Earth. Replacing the hydrocarbon age with the Aether age might mean humanity’s deliverance, a nightmare for the PSQ.   </p>
<p>Rothschild bankstering outlined the PSQ’s hydrocarbon ascent as continuation of an ancient plan. Today only three of the world’s “sovereign” nations remain free of Rothschild-controlled central banking: Cuba, Iran, North Korea. America’s strain of Rothschild infection is called the Federal Reserve System, an insidious disease apparently fatal.</p>
<p>Banks excel at war. Some might say that in war there are no winners, only losers. That is overwhelmingly true, if you don’t count banks. War is not the meat and potatoes of banks, more like the meat and bread: finance industrial military complexes, all sides; concoct the politics to pit nation against nation and kill each other amid banker-maneuvered conflicts; finance all combatants, then butter bread with reconstruction…repeat cycle….</p>
<p>Monopolies on fossil energy, money and war…such is the tripod supporting imminent and absolute PSQ ownership of planet Earth. Every grain of sand, drop of water, every breath. With legs so solid on the PSQ’s three-legged stool of tyranny, the PSQ is solidly enthroned.</p>
<p>But…if humanity can take out one leg we may have a chance at crashing the PSQ’s tripod. For a leader we have arguably the greatest human ever born: Nikola Tesla. He put Aether in our hands. If humanity can elevate into freely developing energy from Aether, thereby breaking the energy leg, we might fall the PSQ’s stool.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the PSQ pummels us with killer body shots. Hydraulic fracturing…ripping fossil fuels from stone hidey holes with biocidal “fracking”. It appears that the PSQ will not rest until everything is fracked-up. But duck and cover! “Fracking” doesn’t bottom us out as fiercely as burning tar for energy. The PSQ is bulldozing humanity into a tar pit for possibly the most humiliating destiny any allegedly “intelligent” species has ever inflicted upon themselves and the ability of their home to support any species above cockroaches.</p>
<p><b>Aether verus Tar</b></p>
</div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
Tesla awarded us with access to immaculate energy of the Cosmos.</p>
<p>So the PSQ is turning pristine Canadian boreal forest vital to biospheric health into hell on Earth, using enormous fossil energies to steam from semi-solid bitumen deposits what some call “Alberta Death Ooze”. A “DilBit” disaster may be coming soon to a town near you.  [<a href="http://insideclimatenews.org/topic/exxon-dilbit-spill-2013">12</a>]</p>
<p>For an “Aether-wise” civilization to be so diseased as to burn tar for energy…talk about a Satanic assault on humanity. SWAT on steroids.</p>

John Dodderidge Quotes</p>
<h3>LIES, SCIENTIFIC DOUBLE STANDARD WITH NO RETRACTIONS OF CDC’s FRAUDULENT VACCINE STUDIES AND INFORMATION</h3>
<p><em>“An <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/topics/lifestyle/health/autism.htm">autism</a> study that was slammed by experts and retracted this week [October 2014] by its publisher is still alive and well on the Internet, thanks to what critics are calling a perfect storm of lax publishing standards” </em></p>
<p><em>“Ten months ago, Hooker said he started talking to William Thompson, a scientist with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Thompson worked on a 2004 autism study published in the medical journal Pediatrics that found no link between autism and vaccines, but he now claims the researchers omitted data that would have shown that there was indeed a link.”</em></p>
<p><em>“I regret that my co-authors and I omitted statistically significant information in our 2004 article published in the journal Pediatrics,” Thompson said in a statement through his lawyer. “The omitted data suggested that African-American males who received the MMR vaccine before age 36 months were at increased risk for autism. Decisions were made regarding which findings to report after the data were collected, and I believe that the final study protocol was not followed.”</em></p>
<p><em>“The 2004 study relied on birth certificates to determine race and other factors thought to contribute to autism, such as low birth weight and parental age. <strong>But birth certificates were missing for 260 black boys who were excluded from the analysis</strong>. Hooker set out to do a “re-analysis” of the 2004 study, relying on school records as an indicator of race to expand the pool of black boys. He published his results in the journal Translational Neurodegeneration on Aug. 8, <strong>concluding that black boys who received the MMR vaccine before 36 months were 3.4 times more likely to have autism than those who did not.”</strong></em></p>

<strong><em>The Vaccine Program: Betrayal of Public Trust &amp; Institutional Corruption—Part 6 of 7.</em></strong></p>
<p><em>“The internal CDC documents reveal that in addition to major methodological flaws and inconsistencies, CDC scientists and Danish scientists collaborated in outright fraud. Thorsen and his co-authors manipulated the results by excluding the largest outpatient clinic in Copenhagen – comprising 20% of autism cases in Denmark – from the pre-1992 cohort – thereby artificially inflating the autism incidence in Denmark after 1992 when thimerosal had been eliminated from children’s vaccines.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Furthermore, the authors of the Pediatrics (2003) article falsified their findings by omitting the 2001 data from their published report. The published report claims an astoundingly high (implausible) increase in the autism prevalence rate in Denmark after the phase-out and removal of thimerosal between 1990 and 1999.”</em></p>
<p><em>“This case reveals much about the corrupted vaccine literature. Indeed, the research community has not only failed to examine Thorsen / CDC research fraud, journal editors are knowingly facilitating fraudulent research articles to influence vaccination policies that put thousands of children at risk, depriving them of living normal lives.”</em></p>
<p><em>“The publicly accessible, internal CDC correspondence<a href="http://mercury-freedrugs.org/docs/110927_ResponseToDanishCommitteeOnSciDishonesty_CombinedLetterExhibits_b.pdf"><sup>[1]</sup></a> allows anyone to trace the underhanded route that led to the publication of the Madsen/Thorsen/ et al report in the journal Pediatrics – after it was rejected by the Lancet and by JAMA. A written communication between Dr. Thorsen and high ranking CDC official, Coleen Boyle (2003) reveals that when the paper was first submitted to Pediatrics with the 2001 data included; it was criticized by one peer-reviewer:</em></p>
<p><em>“The drop of incidence shown for the most recent years is perhaps the most dramatic feature of the figure, and is seen in the oldest age group as well as the youngest.” The reviewer questions the authors’ failure to discuss ‘the possibility that this decrease might have come about through elimination of [T]himerosal’.”</em></p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p><em>“Why hasn’t the CDC ever sponsored such a study? Did the health agency neglect doing so by design? <strong>After reading Mawson’s conclusions, that appears to be the case since it would have run counter to CDC’s messaging that all ‘vaccines are safe’</strong>.” </em>[CJF emphasis]</p>
<p><em>“Some of the study’s findings are eye opening, such as chronic issues disproportionately affecting children along racial, gender, and social class fault-lines in ways that neither the authors nor sponsors imagined.”</em><em> </em></p>
<p><em>“In summary, vaccination, nonwhite race, and male gender were significantly associated with NDD after controlling for other factors . . . Preterm birth combined with vaccination was a strong and synergistic factor for NDD in the final model, more than doubling the odds of NDD compared to vaccination alone.”</em></p>
<p><em>The study defined NDD as “Autism Spectrum Disorder, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, and/or a learning disability.”</em><em> </em></p>
<h3>The Study Accepted, Released, Censored</h3>
<p><em>“Frontiers Journal</em><em> received the study on September 17, 2016. After a two-month peer review process, published it on November 21 for its “68,000 on board editors” from institutions around the world (</em><a href="http://www.frontiersin.org/"><em>www.frontiersin.org</em></a><em>), with the National Institute of Health (NIH) and Harvard University being the top two providing the science editors.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Over the course of four days, more than 80,000 views of the study found it important enough to read, going “viral” according to one familiar with its release. Then on November 28, the bottom fell out when Frontiers scrapped the publication. In one week, it went from being accepted, published, and then retracted. </em><a href="http://retractionwatch.com/2016/11/28/study-linking-vaccines-autism-pulled-frontiers-following-heavy-criticism/"><em>The abstract</em></a><em> can still be found online.”</em></p>
<p><em>“The paper, however, wasn’t retracted; it was “unaccepted,” according to Mawson via email. That means Frontiers didn’t retract it, since it was never officially published. What’s left for a study after its accepted, reviewed 80,000 times in less than 100 hours?” . . . </em><strong>Censorship!?.</strong></p>
<p><em>“Beyond that clarification, Mawson wrote: ‘I am not allowed to comment on the paper/work by my Dean’.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Melissa Cochrane, the communications manager for Frontiers Journal, which is headquartered in Lausanne, Switzerland, replied via email:</em></p>
<p><em>“As we have previously noted, this article was provisionally accepted but not published. In response to concerns raised regarding the abstract and the provisional PDF — which were made provisionally available online — Frontiers then reopened its review. Following further manuscript assessment by the Field Chief Editor of Frontiers in Public Health, in consultation with an external expert, the manuscript was subsequently rejected, not retracted as retraction can only occur once a paper has been officially published and indexed.”</em></p>
<p>“The rejection was due to severe limitations in the validity of the results.”</p>
<p><em>“A day later, Ms. Cochrane replied to an email seeking clarification on the “rejection” process, writing:</em></p>
<p><em>‘The reasons for the rejection were communicated in more detail to the corresponding author but I am unable to give you the reviewer’s comments as the Frontiers’ review process involves an open and collaborative dialogue between the reviewers and the authors, all of whom participate with the understanding and security that Frontiers will keep these exchanges confidential, as explained in our terms of use. You can read more about the Frontiers peer review process </em><a href="http://home.frontiersin.org/about/review-system"><em>here</em></a><em>’</em><em>.”</em></p>
<h3>Vaccines Cause Health Issues Big and Small</h3>
<p><em>“Some of the unsuspected data pulled from the study, includes:</em></p>
<p><em>‘Vaccinated children were significantly less likely than the unvaccinated to have been diagnosed with chickenpox and pertussis, but significantly more likely to have been diagnosed with pneumonia, otitis media [ear infection], allergies and NDDs’.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Numerous reports of AOM [acute otitis media] have been filed with VAERS. A search of VAERS for ‘Cases where age is under 1 and onset interval is 0 or 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or 6 or 7 days and Symptom is otitis media, revealed that 438,573 cases were reported between 1990 and 2011.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Since the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) qualifies that “‘Under-reporting’ is one of the main limitations of passive surveillance systems, including VAERS, (</em><a href="https://vaers.hhs.gov/index"><em>https://vaers.hhs.gov/index</em></a><em>), the number of ear infection cases is far greater than is recorded in VAERS, by a factor of twenty times, according to one Atlanta-area scientist, who wants to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation.</em></p>
<p><em>The vaccinated were also more likely to have used antibiotics, allergy and fever medications; to have been fitted with ventilation ear tubes; visited a doctor for a health issue in the previous year, and been hospitalized’.”</em></p>
<p><em>“So now vaccines cause a lot more than tics, autism, ADHD, and learning disabilities. To the glee of Big Pharma, they also cause allergies, ear problems, and pneumonia. Thus, vaccines are akin to a gardener growing weeds to pull them — a robust reoccurring revenue stream.”</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Vaccines Reprogram the Immune System</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>“</em></strong><em>In a final adjusted model, vaccination but not preterm birth remained associated with NDD, while the interaction of preterm birth and vaccination was associated with a 6.6-fold increased odds of NDD (95% CI: 2.8, 15.5),” the study concluded.</em></p>
<p><em>“For Kevin Barry, father of an autistic teenage boy, and author of </em><a href="http://skyhorsepublishing.com/titles/3955-9781634509954-vaccine-whistleblower"><em>Vaccine Whistleblower</em></a><em>, the book on the domestic fraud committed by Dr. William Thompson at the CDC, he said,</em></p>
<p><em>‘Fully vaccinated, premature, boys is a real danger zone, which isn’t a surprise to anyone in the autism community. But the increase in allergies in the fully vaccinated group is additional circumstantial evidence of the adverse effects of tinkering with an immature immune system’.”</em></p>
<p><em>“What isn’t circumstantial is CDC recommending more vaccines to pregnant women, vaccines that haven’t been tested for safety or efficacy.”</em></p>
<p><strong><em>“Why is the Deep State monolith of CDC and Big Pharma pushing for more jabs that target pregnant women and their fetuses? Is it just for greed and money? Or is there more to this plan to vaccine humans from womb and cradle to grave?” </em></strong><em> </em>[CJF emphasis added]</p>
<p><strong><em>“CDC clearly knows what Mawson’s study found: Vaccines cause an array of health issues in unborn babies, triggering their immune and nervous systems in unnatural ways</em></strong><em>.” </em>[CJF emphasis added]</p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p><em>“Neuro-immunological interfaces of fetal, neonatal and childhood brain development are among the most complex choreographed cell signaling and tissue architecture processes in all of mammalian and human biology. There is no doubt for many scientists and physicians that the vulnerabilities inherent in these complex systems of development are linked. From a systems analysis, it is no surprise to many of us watching this train wreck from afar that injected metals risk both immunological dysregulation and neurological injury,” said Dr. Edward Fogarty in a telephone interview. He is the chairman of the Department of Radiology at the University of North Dakota, School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Southwest Campus Building, and is a father of an autistic teenage son.”</em></p>
<h3>Censorship of Scientific Research</h3>
<p><em>“In learning about the content of the study, Dr. Fogarty said, ‘As an academic and clinical imager who’s specialty is grounded in the ethics of transparency, it is terribly disturbing that this manuscript is getting censored. It begs the question as to why.’ He paused, his voice growing irate, and added, ‘Nowhere else in academia do we see the degree of censorship of inquiry than in this arena. In fact, the economic, professional and political risks of anyone driving safety science in this sphere of U.S public health is so great that it has served to muzzle virtually an entire professional class. Concerned physicians who are surgeons, radiologists, pathologists, primary care physicians, and even pediatricians face whispered threats of loss of licensure for even speaking out from within the profession’.”</em></p>
<p><em>“For Anthony Mawson, who has submitted the study to another scientific journal, it is a waiting game. The key difference between his population-based study and that of the CDC, which hired a Danish mercenary scientist to cook data on </em><a href="http://printarchive.epochtimes.com/a1/en/hk/nnn/2016/07_July/7/A7.pdf"><em>fraudulent studies</em></a><em>, is that Mawson didn’t change the study’s design parameters midstream, or found out what happens if he cut out a swath of data because he didn’t like the results.”</em><em> </em></p>
<p><em>“Sure, Mawson and his study will be attacked by the paid Big Pharma shills and the mainstream media, saying they ‘can’t verify the results,’ because the study design was an anonymous survey of mothers in four states with the unvaccinated children being home-schooled. <strong>But that red herring is baseless, since the CDC used the same survey method in 2015 that produced a stunning </strong></em><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhsr/nhsr087.pdf"><strong><em>1 in 45 incidence</em></strong></a><strong><em> rate of autism in newborn children.” </em></strong>[CJF emphasis added]</p>
<p><em>“Not liking the results of the skyrocketing incidence rate of autism, CDC’s principal investigator for that study, Benjamin Zablotsky, PhD, said in a telephone interview on November 17, 2015, that his study was ‘merely a survey’ and that the CDC would use its ‘gold standard’ surveillance system that, somehow, produced the same 1 in 68 babies born with autism in 2016 in 2014. <strong>But now that alleged CDC fraud of omitting surveillance sites data has been outed, with yet another </strong></em><a href="http://ahrp.org/lawsuit-by-principal-investigator-for-cdc-utah-autism-data-filed-whistleblower-lawsuit/"><strong><em>CDC whistleblower</em></strong></a><strong><em> filing a lawsuit in Utah in 2016’.”</em></strong> [CJF emphasis added]</p>

<h3>Nanoparticles Polluting Vaccines</h3>
<p>Two Italian scientists, Stefano Montanari and Antoinetta Gatti, explain their findings in this video.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">19:54 minute video</p>
</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/Bvtz3iNTx60?t=134">https://youtu.be/Bvtz3iNTx60?t=134</a></p>
<p>Scientist Gatti was about to testify at a Parliament enquiry on vaccine damages of Italian military courses but both researches, who are married to each other, had their home and research raided by police and all their material research and evidence had been taken away by authorities!</p>
<p>The Montanari-Gatti research confirmed vaccines contained nanoparticles of stainless steel, tungsten, copper and other metals, <em>including rare elements,</em> which should not be included in vaccines/vaccinations given to fetuses, pregnant women, newborns, infants and toddlers whose developing lungs, immune and nervous systems are still developing until about two to three years of age!</p>
<p>They also harbored stainless steel, tungsten, <a href="https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.greenmedinfo.com%2Ftoxic-ingredient%2Findustrial-copper-inorganic-0&amp;data=02%7C01%7C%7Ce7df7b01ff30436c008c08d5ab0c9135%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C636602992818010294&amp;sdata=vnKZQ9om4vhTtprmOR5SOHz2f2jCyopPihF60RaLVnM%3D&amp;reserved=0">copper</a>, and other <a href="https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.greenmedinfo.com%2Fdisease%2Fheavy-metal-toxicity&amp;data=02%7C01%7C%7Ce7df7b01ff30436c008c08d5ab0c9135%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C636602992818010294&amp;sdata=FxWUFcBoOYeKc%2BKwlHuBWUxraeOjHEx1zp0o3%2BR7Deg%3D&amp;reserved=0">metals</a> and rare elements that don’t belong in shots given to fetuses, pregnant women, newborns, babies and toddlers developing their lungs, immune and nervous systems.”</p>
<p>Their research and expose’ of metallic nanoparticles in vaccines was published in <strong><em>the International Journal of Vaccines &amp; Vaccination</em></strong>, Volume 1 Issue 4 2017 as <strong>“</strong><strong>New Quality-Control Investigations on Vaccines: Micro- and Nanocontamination”[1]</strong> wherein the final paragraph of the Conclusion of the article stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>A further purification of the vaccines could improve their quality and could probably decrease the number and seriousness of the adverse incidental effects.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>_____</p>
<h3>Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) and <em>Multiple Vaccine Implication</em> Court-Verified</h3>
<p>In a Vaccine Court case, which vaccine proponents seemingly want to dismiss as “not so,” the following factual information is part of the Vaccine Court Judge’s ruling—<strong><em>therefore FACTUAL</em></strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Petitioners have put forth preponderant evidence that the vaccines J.B. received on September 2, 2011 actually caused or substantially contributed to his death from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome</strong>. Furthermore, respondent has failed to put forth preponderant evidence that J.B.’s death was in fact caused by factors unrelated to the vaccines. [Pg. 2]</p>
<p>“The multi-factorial analysis, including vaccines as an extrinsic risk factor, meets the Shyface standard that the vaccine need not be the sole or even predominant factor but must be a “but for cause” and a substantial factor in causing the death. Shyface, 165 F.3d at 1352. In this case, I have concluded, <strong>after review of the evidence, that it is more likely than not that the vaccines played a substantial causal role in the death of J.B. without the effect of which he would not have died. </strong>The role of inflammatory cytokines as neuro-modulators in the infant medulla has been well described and is likely the reason for a significant number of SIDS deaths occurring in conjunction with mild infection. <strong>I have concluded that it is more likely than not that the vaccine-stimulated cytokines had the same effect in this vulnerable infant during sleep.”</strong>  [Pg. 55] [Emphasis added]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The above ruling is part of the <strong><em>Conclusion</em></strong> Vaccine Court Special Master Thomas L. Gowen handed down in a 55-page opinion dated July 10, 2017 in the case of  <strong><em>CHASE BOATMON &amp; MAURINA CUPID, parents of J.B., deceased, </em></strong>regarding the</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Entitlement Decision;</strong> Diphtheria- Tetanus-acellular Pertussis (DTaP) Vaccine; Inactivated Polio Vaccine  (IPV); Haemophilus Influenzae (HiB) Vaccine; Pneumococcal Conjugate  (PCV) Vaccine; Rotavirus Vaccine;  Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS)[2].</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The above further demonstrates a serious legal/medical issues not considered in the 1905 <em>Jacobson</em> SCOTUS decision.  </strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gowen decision </strong>thereby confirms what the 1905 SCOTUS court contended, i.e.,  <strong>“<em>some children, by reason of their condition at the time, might not be fit subjects for vaccination, and it is suggested –and we will not say without reason—that such is the case with some adults.”</em></strong> [See Part 1, page 1 for more details.]  Therefore, another explicit reason for scuttling<em> Jacobson</em>!</p>
<p><strong>The Gowen decision</strong> also reiterates the need for legal reform(s) regarding the inoculation of multiple-vaccine-actives given at one time, especially to vulnerable pregnant females, infants and toddlers—something not germane nor included in the 2015 <em>Jacobson</em> decision.</p>
<p><strong>Therefore those legal/medical/health issues must be addressed by SCOTUS in light of the current ‘state of the art’ vaccinology of administering multiple-valent vaccines.</strong></p>
<h3>The Monograph “Prayer”</h3>
<p>In law and legal papers (Briefs) filed with the courts, there is a finalized section known as the <em>“Conclusion and Prayer for Relief,”</em> referring to what the claimant/plaintiff seeks from the court as a legal remedy.</p>
<p><em>“Specify what relief you are seeking, particularly if you are looking for something complicated.”<strong>[3]</strong></em><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p>The <strong><em>Arguments, Proofs, Lies and Double Standards…</em></strong> presented in this Monograph are the preeminent reasons for revisiting <strong><em>Jacobson v. Massachusetts </em></strong>because fraud and deceit negate and deprive citizens of their right to informed consent, plus impose undue hardship and duress upon vaccine-damaged vaccinees and their families from the false narrative promoted by CDC/FDA that vaccines do not cause Autism, whereas those federal agencies went out of their way on numerous occasions to eliminate incriminating data sets from being published, thereby causing the current Autism health crisis in the USA and world-wide.</p>
<p><strong><em>Truth </em>[fact]<em> is the</em></strong> <strong><em>absolute defense[4]</em></strong> one learns in Law 101. Case law <em>Jacobson</em> from 1905 stands at legal odds because current fraud and illegal activities and actions are used to deliberately deny or subvert facts; impugn the law and the practice of law, which lawyers and judges, as members of the legal and judicial systems, are expected to abide by, enforce and not abet, including taking necessary corrective action when it is necessary to protect the population at large, as is the current situation with record-setting Autism rates and escalating chronic disease rates in USA children.</p>
<p><strong>In view of the deliberate collusion and fraudulent actions taken by the CDC/FDA, MDs and medical professions, Big Pharma and vaccine makers</strong>, as documented in this Monograph but not to the full extent of what exists and would be found during <em>Discovery </em>in a lawsuit, a totally new, apparently illegal and unethical substandard version of medical science and the law have been perpetrated upon healthcare consumers of every age: infants, toddlers, teens, adults and senior citizens.</p>
<p>The <em>consequential assault and battery practices</em> parents and vaccinees experience from pediatricians and physicians result from the inordinate demands for compulsory vaccinations based upon collusion, fraud and deceit, while totally disregarding the lack of enforcing and protecting consumers’ rights to fully informed consent and self-determination about rejecting toxic/poisonous chemicals and foreign matter injected into oneself or one’s children that were not the issue –nor considered – back in 1905 when <em>Jacobson</em> was litigated and decided.</p>
<p><em>Jacobson</em> stated,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Those who refuse vaccination would be prosecuted.</strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobson_v._Massachusetts#cite_note-:0-1"><strong><sup>[1]</sup></strong></a> <strong>The fine for refusal of the vaccination was a $5 monetary fine, equivalent to about $130 today.</strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobson_v._Massachusetts#cite_note-:2-3"><strong><sup>[3]</sup></strong></a><strong> Pastor Jacobson refused <u>vaccination by saying that “he and his son had had bad reactions to earlier vaccinations.” Because of his refusal of the vaccination, Jacobson was fined $5</u> and appealed to the Supreme Court. </strong>[….]</p>

<p><strong>Justice </strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Marshall_Harlan"><strong>John Marshall Harlan</strong></a><strong> delivered the decision for a 7-2 majority. He rejected Jacobson’s claim that the </strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution"><strong>Fourteenth Amendment</strong></a><strong> gave him the right to refuse vaccination. Harlan deemed that the <u>Massachusetts state punishment of a fine or imprisonment on those who refused vaccines was acceptable</u>, <u>but those individuals could not be forcibly vaccinated</u>.</strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobson_v._Massachusetts#cite_note-5"><strong><sup>[5]</sup></strong></a><strong> <u>At the end of his decision, he acknowledged that for certain individuals, the requirement of vaccination would be cruel and inhumane and so an overreach of government power. That created a medical exemption for adults under the Massachusetts health law, but Harlan denied that Henning Jacobson deserved exemption.</u></strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobson_v._Massachusetts#cite_note-Pox-6"><strong><sup>[6]</sup></strong></a></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobson_v._Massachusetts">(Source: Wikipedia)</a> [CJF emphasis]</p>
<p>However, the above SCOTUS ruling stating <strong><em>“those individuals could not be forcibly vaccinated”</em></strong> differs totally from the CDC federal agency over-reach in 2016 and forward, when the CDC granted itself extreme powers of mandatory control regarding vaccines/vaccinations in <strong>the 2016 CDC “Control of Communicable Diseases</strong>”[5] 8. § 70.14: <strong>“Requirements Relating to Issuance of a Federal Order for Quarantine, Isolation, or Conditional Release,” </strong>which must be addressed for its “inhumane and unreasonable conditions.”</p>
<p><strong><em>Justice Harlan acknowledged an</em></strong> <strong><em><u>individual could not be forcibly vaccinated</u> in 1905, so how come the CDC is not abiding by that part of the Jacobson case law it cites to enforce its “police powers”?  Why is Congress not exercising oversight?  Therefore, there is the absolute need for a long-overdue </em></strong><strong><em>Certiorari</em></strong> <strong><em>brief on</em></strong> <strong><em>Jacobson v. Massachusetts to be filed in 2018.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Current man-made chemical ‘factors’ were not an issue in Jacobson v. Massachusetts in 1905</em></strong>, but present an imperative need for definitive legal case law and statutes <strong><em>now</em></strong> to protect U.S. citizens from forcefully being injected with neurotoxic chemicals and other pollutants[6] going directly into their and their children’s bloodstreams in order to partake in various activities associated with communal life.</p>
<p><strong><em>An equivalent in using chemicals on humans without their consent is the research and activity which took place in the concentration camps of Adolph Hitler using unknown chemical concoctions for various reasons—including eugenics</em></strong>.  Furthermore, those atrocities were documented during the Nuremberg trials, which resulted in and produced the Nuremberg Code.</p>
<p><strong>Mandatory vaccinations</strong> and neurotoxic chemicals injected under purview of USA federal and state health agencies mandates, medical professions and their professional associations, couched in antiquated case law (1905 <em>Jacobson</em>) <strong>totally violate</strong> <strong>Nuremberg, medical ethics and must be prosecuted.</strong></p>
<p>Furthermore and most importantly, the <strong><em>Precautionary Principle</em></strong> – <strong>the underpinning principle of medicine: <em>“first do no harm”</em></strong> – has been disregarded totally with regard to vaccines erroneously being declared “safe and effective” and<em> necessary</em> when, in fact, they are totally toxic and young Americans diseases[7] are escalating extraordinarily.</p>
<p><strong>Logic offers <em>if </em>vaccines were effective and safe, such health anomalies should not be occurring.</strong>  Approximately 27% of U.S. children live with chronic diseases[8] something that parallels the ever increasing vaccine schedule from the CDC/FDA during the last fifty years.</p>
<p>According to <strong><em>Autoimmunity Research Foundation[9]</em></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The last half century has seen a steady increase in the incidence and prevalence of chronic inflammatory diseases with further increases expected. According to the </em><a href="https://mpkb.org/home/pathogenesis"><em>Marshall Pathogenesis</em><em>A description for how chronic inflammatory diseases originate and develop</em></a><em>, a number of factors are to blame: </em> [5 factors are blamed, and the fifth is]</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>“widespread adoption of compulsory mass <a href="https://mpkb.org/home/special/vaccines_and_shots">vaccinations</a>”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Thus this urgent Prayer and Call</em></strong> <strong><em>for a</em></strong> long-overdue <strong><em>Certiorari</em></strong> <strong><em>brief </em></strong>on <strong><em>Jacobson v. Massachusetts.  </em></strong></p>
<p>That legal action is necessary due to 113 intervening years [<em>1905 versus 2018</em>] with all the prevailing fraud and illegal aspects that have impacted the present vaccine/vaccination paradigm <strong><em>as verifiable fraudulent vaccinology consensus science.</em></strong></p>
<p>The cost of healthcare in 2016 in the USA was 17.9% of the GDP (gross domestic product).  Despite such expenditures, the <strong><em>U.S. Spends More on Health Care Than Other High-Income Nations But Has Lower Life Expectancy, Worse Health[10].</em></strong></p>
<p>According to a <strong><em>Los Angeles Times</em></strong> article[11] <strong><em>“</em></strong><strong><em>The U.S. spends more on healthcare than any other country — but not with better health outcomes.” </em></strong></p>
<p>It is now time to look <strong><em><u>objectively</u></em></strong> at <strong><em>“correlation is not causation”</em></strong> roles vaccines and vaccinations play in the overall poor health of USA citizens, especially vaccination health protocols affecting the last two generations of children, which parallels the increase in adverse health statistical data.</p>
<p>Just because the CDC/FDA, Big Pharma and vaccine makers ‘pontificate’ correlation is not causation as a fallacy is an absolute falsehood, since those actors are the very perpetrators of the fraud and deceit in vaccinology.</p>
<p><strong>Why are vaccines always designated as ‘safe and effective’, when no independent research – other than Big Pharma’s and vaccine makers <em>fudged studies and papers</em> – are reported and considered ‘gospel truth’?  </strong></p>
<p><strong>Confirmation of scientific fake journals being published is found in the 2009 article <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/27383/title/Elsevier-published-6-fake-journals/">“Elsevier published 6 fake journals”</a>.  </strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Is that why the statue of Justice is blindfolded, so she cannot see the facts, figures and fudged science specifically pertaining to vested interests in vaccines?</em></strong></p>

<b><a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2012/06/bilderberg-2012-marks-turning-point-in.html">Activist Post</a></b></p>
<p>The 2012 Bilderberg meeting at the Westfields Marriott in Chantilly, Virginia marked the first time I have attended a protest geared toward exposing this particular private cabal which is instrumental in choosing Presidents and Vice Presidents, as well as determining the life and death of millions of people and the economic fate of billions more.</p>
<p>I honestly had no idea what to expect as I made my way to the hotel. Being a realist by nature, I expected to encounter heavy security and only a handful of determined protesters carrying signs and repeating anti-Bilderberg chants; typical protest stuff. </p>
<p>What I found, however, was somewhat of a surprise. Of course, the heavy police presence was exactly what I expected. But there was significantly more than a mere handful of protesters waiting at the hotel entrance. In fact, the crowd was about three times the size I thought it would be. Obviously, the signs were there and so were the chants. But there was no doubt that this protest was something different. </p>
<p><a name="more"></a>I must admit that it is difficult to describe in words just what was so different about this demonstration as compared to others I have attended in the past. Indeed, after talking with other activists, journalists, and demonstrators, I have found that the majority of them have come away with the same outlook regarding this year’s Bilderberg meeting. That is, that they took part in something special this weekend and that the protest surrounding Bilderberg 2012 was some kind of a turning point.</p>
<p>In truth, the size of the crowd was secondary to the energy it produced, and the energy surrounding the overall event.</p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>
The political makeup of the protesters was extremely diverse with libertarians, socialists, anarchists, war veterans, anti-war activists, Christians, New-Agers, Occupy protesters, and those with no affiliation whatsoever coming together not as a mob but as a grouping of Individuals who have the same goals and interests. </p>
<p>Throughout the demonstration, one could walk through the crowd and witness discussions and debates, all of them mutually respectful, regarding history, philosophies, and solutions.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/ultimatesurvivalplan.html" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 0em;margin-left: 1em" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-CTsdDqKcvhI/T7GjToaksaI/AAAAAAAAO2s/8vEb9HmqOhk/s316/160x316.gif"></a>One such debate was a conversation <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2012/06/fascinating-debate-between-tarpley-and.html">captured on camera</a> between Webster Tarpley and Adam Kokesh, two individuals of very different backgrounds and political pedigrees, but who are nevertheless in complete agreement about the dangers posed to the world population by cabals such as the Bilderberg Group.</p>
<p>As I mentioned above, the electric energy present at Bilderberg was both unmistakable and indescribable. There were even times when it felt as if there was some kind of unconscious telepathy taking place between the protesters, as one could immediately pick out other activists when walking down the street far from the hotel itself. No one needed to be decked out in political shirts or carrying signs – you just knew.  I truly felt there was no need to formally introduce myself to other demonstrators because, from the moment I reached the event, it felt as if I was visiting a group of old friends and family.</p>
<p>In fact, the protest felt more like a festival than a demonstration. Although Mark Dice was obviously making a joke by dubbing the demonstration “Bilderfest 2012,” it was also an accurate description of the event. Adam Kokesh felt the same way as he described the protest as a “summit” for alternative media. </p>
<p>Author JG Vibes agrees <a href="http://aotmr.com/diverse-activist-groups-unify-to-protest-bilderberg-2012/">when he writes</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>Everyone was well aware that they were standing just yards away from some of the most evil conversations that could possibly be taking place, but that didn’t mean that the atmosphere outside had to take the same tone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This statement brings us to another aspect of this protest that made it so different from all the others. The 2012 Bilderberg Demonstration exhibited a startling lack of anger and hatred; rather it was an startling amount of love and commitment to one other that defined the atmosphere. This is not to say that the protesters were not angry or that they didn’t hate the criminals meeting inside the hotel; it is to say that the anger they carried was not the anger that consumes the one that harbors it. It was the kind of anger that produces peaceful resistance and productive change. </p>
<p>Even in the midst of the heavy police presence and the fact that, only a few yards away from them, plans were being made to further tighten the noose fastened around the neck of the general population, the activists maintained this spirit of love and community, all the while making enough noise to cause at least some disruption of the globalists meeting inside the hotel. </p>
<p>Again, as JG Vibes writes:</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>The vibe outside was one of celebration, love, togetherness, and peaceful resistance. Everyone was excited to share that moment with one another, and were excited to see such an unprecedented turnout for something that has remained secret for so many years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In terms of community I, myself, was thrilled to meet so many people of like minds and to have the opportunity to discuss with them the issues that have become such guiding factors in all of our lives. I was also immeasurably pleased to meet one of the individuals who played a role in my own awakening, as well as several other activists, researchers, and journalists whose work I have greatly admired from a distance for some time. </p>
<p>In all honesty, when I first realized that I would have this opportunity, I must confess at having some question in the back of my mind as to whether or not some of these individuals are as real and sincere as they have presented themselves to be through their public work. After all, such doubt and possibility is human nature.</p>
<p>However, I am now pleased to say that, although I only met them briefly, I am convinced that they are indeed as sincere and dedicated as they appear to be from a distance. There is no question in my mind that these people are absolutely determined to promote freedom and humanity in the face of the obstacles currently placed in front of us. </p>
<p>With this in mind, it is important for all of us to remember that we may disagree with each other’s political philosophies and methods of presentation, but we cannot allow these disagreements to divide us. We must be able to hold views that are different from those around us while still working together for the same common goal. Not only that, we must maintain the ability to be respectful and tolerant of each other on those issues and areas where we may disagree. </p>
<p>Lastly, we cannot forget to mention the man who dedicated so many years of his life to exposing this secretive cabal of globalists known as the Bilderberg Group. Jim Tucker has been following and reporting on Bilderberg for well over thirty years and, for most of those years, was labeled a conspiracy theorist by almost everyone in the mainstream media and ignored by all the rest.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/unexplainable.html" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_qLAIskTQXUc/TdShMb4n6MI/AAAAAAAAI3o/d72a9NrD4wE/unexmys.gif"></a>When Tucker first began his work against Bilderberg, he was laughed at, ridiculed, and ostracized. No one showed up to protest the meetings because virtually no one knew about them. No mainstream news agencies followed up on his reports because they were owned by the individuals he was trying to expose. Even many outside of the mainstream media were reluctant to follow this rabbit hole any further. </p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>One can only imagine the discouragement Tucker must have felt as he watched his reports — which were the result of a great deal of hard and dangerous work, as well as financial and geographical inconvenience — be so easily dismissed the moment they were released. </p>
<p>Yet he still persisted where most others would have given up long ago.</p>

</div>
<p>Now, over thirty years later, not even the mainstream media can continue calling Jim Tucker a conspiracy theorist with any sincerity.</p>
<p>What he was once laughed at for reporting, the <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/7804197/The-Bilderberg-Group-fact-and-fantasy.html">London Telegraph</a>, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-news-blog/2012/jun/01/bilderberg-2012-chantilly-occupy?newsfeed=true">London Guardian</a>, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/is-bilderberg-a-conference-on-world-affairs-or-a-powerful-global-cabal-depends-on-who-you-ask/2012/06/01/gJQA5uqx7U_story.html">Washington Post</a>, and <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/may/31/demonstrators-heckle-bilderberg-attendees/">Washington Times</a> have now been forced to address in their own publications. </p>
<p>While once following and infiltrating Bilderberg alone, Tucker is now greeted by close to a thousand protesters. He is now standing side by side with a large contingent of the alternative media and even a tiny portion of those from the mainstream.</p>
<p>Although Tucker has grown much older since his first exposé of Bilderberg many years ago, I cannot help but to express immense joy that he has been able to live to see his tireless effort and often thankless work turn into such an event, and to know that it is largely because of him that demonstrations like Bilderberg 2012 are taking place. Such is an honor that many men never receive and it is one that Jim Tucker truly deserves. Indeed, it is thanks to Jim Tucker that Bilderberg is greeted with a growing number of protesters and new leaks every year. </p>
<p>Although these meetings are still conducted in the dark, they are forced to work harder and harder to dodge the light.</p>

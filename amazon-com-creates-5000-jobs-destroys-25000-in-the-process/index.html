<b><a href="//www.caseyresearch.com/go/vjdf7-2/ATP">Casey Research</a></b></p>
<p><b>The Technology Jobs Conundrum</b></p>
<p>The past few weeks have seen the tech and business media abuzz about a  not-so-little warehouse in Tennessee. That’s because this distribution  center, opening its doors with a burst of fanfare and even a few visits  from nearby politicians, isn’t a jumping-off point for Macy’s or Target.  Instead, the warehouse is the latest in a series of new locations being  opened by retail technology giant Amazon.com.</p>
<p>The jobs this new mega-warehouse is purported to create: 5,000.</p>
<p>The politicians who made the quick trip to Tennessee to get in front of  the cameras included one President Barack Obama, who gave a rousing  speech not just about the importance of the 5,000 jobs promised at this  one facility (and another 2,000 corollary positions at customer service  centers elsewhere in the country), but also about the “need” to raise  taxes on the businesses that are creating them and use those taxes to  fund “infrastructure” jobs in green energy and natural gas, among other  areas.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>The politically charged speech and the press conference from Amazon.com  touting its job-creation abilities have understandably drawn quite the  skeptical reaction from some. But surprisingly, in all the talk I’ve  heard in the media these past few days, most of the fury seems directed  not at the proposed tax hikes, but at Amazon itself for creating what  might be fewer jobs than it claims … and possibly for destroying more  jobs than it creates.</p>
<p>Along with its jobs announcement, Amazon’s PR department was ready for  the utterly predictable media criticism that the jobs are nothing more  than menial, low-wage shop floor jobs. Its retort? These new jobs will  pay on average 30% higher than typical retail jobs. That’s a good thing  for the employed, no doubt, to be paid more for a similar skill-level  job.</p>
<div align="center">
<p>    <ins class="adsbygoogle" style="height: 90px;width: 728px"></ins></p>
<p>    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || ).push({});</p>
</div>
<p>
But with its emphasis on low prices, how can Amazon afford to boost  those wages so much? It all boils down to efficiency. Think about Amazon  versus another retailing giant without the same level of sales, but  with a similar “low prices” kind of push: TJX companies (owners of TJ  Maxx, Marshalls, and Home Goods). Last year, Amazon had retail sales of  over $60 billion globally (up from $47 billion in 2011); TJX brought in  about half that, at almost $26 billion globally (up from $23 billion in  2011).</p>
<p>Whatever the companies’ similarities, the differences between the two  couldn’t be bigger; and those differences have profound impacts for  investors, as well as for the future of our economy.</p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>
<script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
<ins class="adsbygoogle"
     style="display:block; text-align:center;"
     data-ad-layout="in-article"
     data-ad-format="fluid"
     data-ad-client="ca-pub-3987358164777632"
     data-ad-slot="2109552235"></ins>
<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script></div>

<p>On one hand, you have companies like TJX—so-called “bricks and mortar”  retailers—which in order to do business every day must staff a few  thousand stores, and keep them open for 10, 12, or even 24 hours per  day. That means greeters, checkers, security, customer service, and  stockroom employees, plus bright lighting, catchy displays, and other  ordinary features of a quality retail facility.</p>
<p>Companies like Amazon have bricks and mortar too, of course, as  displayed on the recent junket in Tennessee.  But that’s about all they  have. Amazon can operate in facilities far off the beaten path, with  nothing but wire shelves and cement floors, and they can serve just as  many customers from only a fraction of the locations—and a fraction of  the manpower—that their competitors require. On just about every front,  the company is more efficient than its peers. But let’s look  specifically at two of the top expenses for virtually any retail  company: its plant and its people.</p>
<p><b>Facilities </b></p>
<p>Last year, TJX ended with 3,055 stores, making it one of the most  prolific clothing and home goods retailers in the US. It pegs its sales  at a respectable $8.5 million annually per store. That’s not a big-box  retailer like Best Buy, which racked up $25 million per store in 2011,  but it’s solid compared to many other clothing and home goods retailers  (like Sears, with much larger stores and only $9.5 million in per  location sales, or the Gap, with smaller, mall-style stores and only $5  million per outlet).</p>
<p>Amazon doesn’t have stores, of course. It has “fulfillment centers,”  just like the new one in Tennessee that the POTUS visited. As of May  2013, a few dozen such centers are scattered across the world, including  37 in the US and 2 in Canada, and another dozen plus in Europe:</p>
<div style="text-align: center"><a href="https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/130801image1.jpg" rel="lightbox" style="text-align: center"><img alt="" height="380" src="https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/130801image1.jpg" style="margin: 0px auto" width="540"></a></div>
<p>
Of course, it’s unfair to count only fulfillment centers, as the  company handles customer service at separate locations, something a  retailer like TJX would normally handle mostly onsite in the stores  (excepting the separate online sales division, but that constitutes only  a small fraction of TJX’s business). Add in those locations, plus the  newest centers Amazon plans to open, and you still have fewer than 100  retail operations centers globally.</p>
<p>If we round up just to be fair, that pegs Amazon’s sales per location for the past year at $660 million, or about <b>80 times</b> the sales per location of a TJX.</p>
<p>In addition to the amount of dollars per square foot in revenue that  Amazon can push out its doors, the company can strike deals to grab land  in otherwise desolate areas for its facilities, so long as UPS and  FedEx will service them—no need for high-rent districts with lots of  shopper traffic. This means that not only does the company have to  support fewer square feet of space and make each square foot less  glamorous, it can also push into districts willing to offer it big tax  savings, or where construction costs are highly depressed (often one and  the same). Amazon’s negotiation power and economies of scale are both  significantly higher than the average multi-thousand storefront  retailer.</p>
<p><b>Employment</b></p>
<p>Of course, having more sales per location means less if you have to  fill that location with just as many people to get the goods out the  door. Sure, you save on the overhead from electricity to property taxes,  but you can only gain so much efficiency in a labor-intensive business.  But here too, Amazon’s differences are broadly apparent.</p>

<p>Amazon’s demand is just as cyclical as any other retailer. When queried  at the press conference in Tennessee, a company rep wouldn’t specify  how many of the 5,000 promised new jobs are part-time and seasonal. He  instead jumped back to the pre-approved talking point about pay being  30% higher on average. The spokesman did acknowledge that a good number  of them would not be full-time, year-round positions.</p>
<p>(Amazon is able to staff much more efficiently than most retailers  during non-holiday seasons, thanks to real-time, around-the-clock  operations management and the ability to pull staff in for extra shifts  and on short notice—a more difficult task for traditional storefront  retailers, because having 10 extra people show up tomorrow from midnight  to 6 a.m. doesn’t help move any more product. So it’s reasonable to  assume Amazon will have more seasonal help as a percentage than most  other retailers.)</p>
<p>In all, though, Amazon has managed to grow to its current level with  just about 89,000 employees, or almost exactly half of TJX’s workforce.  To do that yet pull down 150% more revenue makes Amazon about <b>five times more efficient</b> than TJX, measured by retail sales per staffer.</p>
<p>Amazon is able to do so because the number of shoppers who can be  served per warehouse employee is much higher than at a typical retail  location—especially the smaller stores that TJX mostly uses. The same  goes for all the servers the company operates: one IT guy can take the  midnight shift and keep a few thousand servers up and running, but one  janitor cannot clean the floors at two locations, let alone 400—and many  other aspects of the business share this limitation.</p>
<p><b> Stacking Up Against Retail’s Big Boys</b></p>
<p>TJX wasn’t cherry-picked as a counterexample—there are many retailers  with far worse operating margins than TJX to pick on if that was the  goal. Amazon stands out head and shoulders above nearly all other  retailers in efficiency. Even when stacked up against larger competitors  which can bring more scale to the business than TJX can, such as retail  megastore Walmart, whose $470 billion in sales don’t put a dent in the  revenue-per-employee figure:</p>

As is obvious above, Amazon’s revenue per employee is leaps and bounds  above its competition. The only other one on our short list that comes  close is CVS, but despite the public perception of the company as a  retailer, it now generates the overwhelming majority of its revenues  from its insurance programs, so it’s partially miscategorized. Even so,  it still doesn’t come close to Amazon in terms of revenue efficiency;  CVS would need to grow its sales by greater than 50% without adding a  single staffer in order to catch up.</p>
<p>Walmart? It would have to lay off over two-thirds of its employees or triple its same-store sales to even come close.</p>
<p>Amazon’s revenue efficiency is remarkable by virtually any standard.  And it’s one of the reasons that despite a long track record of  underperforming on earnings, the company has generally stayed in the  market’s good graces and been granted a hefty valuation relative to its  peers. The market sees Amazon for what it is—a technology company with  leverage that can grow revenues in a big way—and not a more traditional  retailer.</p>
<p>But this also means that for every jar of <a href="http://www.caseyresearch.com/go/vjd59-2/ATP" target="_blank">Crazy Aaron’s Thinking Putty</a>  that is shipped out the door, the number of people on the payroll is  only one-fourth that of Walmart or Target … or one-fifth that of TJX.</p>

<p>Does this mean that Barack Obama is right? Does the government need to  step in, tax these efficient companies harder, and spend that money on  solar farms, wind turbines, and transport infrastructure? After all, you  cannot efficiently deliver tens of millions of packages when roads are  choked and bridges are crumbling.</p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>At first glance, it would be easy to jump to that conclusion. That’s  the direction I heard quite a few of Tuesday and Wednesday’s  commentators heading with their questions, even on business-oriented  stations like my morning commute companion, Bloomberg Radio.</p>
<p>And yes, in some senses, for every job Amazon “creates,” four other jobs go away at a company like TJX.</p>
<p>But it’s not that simple. First, with any efficiency comes inefficiency  on another point. The relative competitiveness of two business models  is driven by the economic weight of those items in contrast to each  other—an equation that changes over time. For instance, Clayton  Christensen eloquently pointed out years ago in his book <i><a href="http://www.caseyresearch.com/go/vjd9a-2/ATP" target="_blank">The Innovator’s Dilemma</a></i>  (available at Amazon.com, of course) that at one point the commonplace  hydraulic backhoes and diggers that litter every construction site in  the modern world were once considered vastly inferior to their  cable-actuated big brothers. Per foot, they couldn’t—and still can’t—dig  nearly as wide a moat per pass. But it didn’t matter. They won the  overall market on convenient smaller sizes, easier maintenance, and  better safety. Their inefficiencies were simply smaller than the value  of their improvements.</p>
<p>Much the same, while you can argue about Amazon’s relative efficiency to TJX, you must be careful not to discount its <b>IN</b>efficiency.  For instance, at a store like TJMaxx, one truckload of goods can  restock the place for weeks. To deliver the orders of a few dozen Amazon  customers might require dozens of individual packages, shipped to half a  dozen different sort facilities, and put on a few dozen different  trucks.</p>
<div class="code-block code-block-1" style="margin: 0px">
<div align="center" class="mrf-external">
<a href="https://amorain.com/?E=ikLQsSIi%2fgaXBh0SRK5s8g%3d%3d&amp;s1="><img src="https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/500.jpg"></a></p>

</div>
<p>TJX benefits from all the dinosaur dung burned by its customers coming  to the store and driving goods back home for it. Amazon, on the other  hand, takes those nearly countless millions of extra miles and absorbs  them into its business model. Compared in this way, Amazon is incredibly  inefficient.</p>
<p>What Amazon doesn’t spend hiring direct employees, the company outsources to others, and the sum of those expenses is enormous.</p>
<p>In fact, the company is so good at spending that gross margin per  staffer, that it usually manages to spend it all. Just look at this  graph of Amazon’s gross revenue and its profits for the past five years…</p>
<div style="text-align: center"><a href="https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/130801image2.jpg" rel="lightbox" style="text-align: center"><img alt="" height="300" src="https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/130801image2.jpg" style="margin: 0px auto" width="540"></a></div>
<p>
You might have to squint to find the red bars that represent profits.  The difference between those two sets of colored bars is the amount  Amazon spends on not just its 89,000 employees, but all of its  operations and marketing. All of those dollars flow into the economy, be  it through FedEx drivers and pilots, outsourced programmers, content  licensing agreements, purchases of inventory to keep its unimaginable  selection of goods growing, or any of hundreds of other paths. And each  path is itself a series of jobs generated and a series of taxes that  eventually do flow to the government to fund all of its activities—from  building fences to keep out Mexicans to staffing the IRS to collect all  that money.</p>
<p>Even <b>if</b> the company was profitable, the same would be  true. Those people who made more money would be inclined to invest and  spend it. The higher the relative profitability, the more free cash  flow, and the more likely it is to turn into additional spending.</p>
<p>Any company whose technology improves efficiency in these ways is going  to reduce employment in the affected industry. That’s the breaks. But  it does not necessarily mean those jobs are gone forever.</p>
<p>A time will come when the amount of efficiency gained by automation,  aggregation, logistics, and other techniques puts another significant  and serious dent in the demand for labor—we’ve already seen it with  low-skill manufacturing jobs, and we are seeing it take hold now in  retail sales. But that does not have to mean the end of the economy or  an economy of no jobs. Instead, the efficiency flows outward to create  new opportunities surrounding the new business and its investors.</p>
<p>Revenue efficiency creates demand for business services. What is not  done in house gets pushed to other networks of suppliers—services  contracted by the sellers or by the buyers. Also, profit efficiency  creates income for investors, which gets reinvested into more new  businesses. Just look to the Silicon Valley venture-capital scene, and  you’ll see years of investment gains flowing back into the markets to  the tune of multiple billions of dollars per year in investments into  companies bent on reinventing every area of the economy, from  entertainment to building supplies to biotechnology to car rental,  through technology.</p>
<p>The biggest risk to our economy and employment is not innovation, which  speeds up the flow of capital. Rather, the risks to be on the lookout  for are the ones that compromise the ability of businesses to innovate,  or which otherwise impede the flow of capital—<i>i.e.</i>, those that restrict lending, cause people or companies to hoard cash, or generate fear and distrust among trading partners.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/backyardliberty.html" rel="nofollow" style="float: right;margin-bottom: 0em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-S6RfjP7Lvo8/USlEmRqWjJI/AAAAAAAAUgk/Zio_5z2T_gE/s200/prep.gif"></a>Fears over banking failures in 2008 showed just how serious this risk  can be. And while the short-term reaction of shoring up liquidity in  financial markets may look to have been a smart one in retrospect, the  long-term lack of consequences for outright criminal activity in that  sector are damning for the future of the economy. Trust in our  government, bankers, and currency continues to be at all-time lows, a  factor that can only be slowing the return of economic growth.</p>
<p>If Barack Obama and camp want to generate more government revenues,  they should consider backing off on the new taxes and focus instead on  limiting the regulations that impede the flow of capital. They should  help secure confidence in the economy, not just through buoying up the  stock markets, but through justice and prudent oversight over the value  of our money and security of our savings.</p>
<p>Companies like Amazon thankfully continue to invest and grow despite  the rising tide of operational regulations (for all the deregulation in  banking over the past 20 years, the same cannot be said of any other  sector) and the continued political immunity of the banking class. As it  does so, its innovations are making life better for the majority of  people. While the industry-wide shift of employment will be painful to  some, over time the economy will adjust, as it always has, and other  employment opportunities will fill the gaps created.</p>
<p>Plus, it’s not like Amazon has a lock on retail efficiency. After all,  Costco—the star quarterback of the big-box store movement—generates over  $975,000 in sales per employee. Yes, it seems like even Amazon could  still learn a few things.</p>
<p>As for the question of whether more efficient companies—which employ  software and even robots (as Amazon does in its warehouses increasingly  every year) to save on labor—destroy more jobs than they create… it’s  not as simple as it might seem at first. Innovation ultimately benefits  society, so we must be careful not to hamper it for fear of the unknown  future it will bring.</p>

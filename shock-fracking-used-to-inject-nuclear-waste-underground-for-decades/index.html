<a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2015/03/shock-fracking-used-to-inject-nuclear.html"><b>Activist Post</b></a></p>
<p>Unearthed articles from the 1960s detail how nuclear waste was buried  beneath the Earth’s surface by Halliburton &amp; Co. for decades as a  means of disposing the by-products of post-World War II atomic energy  production.</p>
<p>Fracking is already a controversial practice on its face; allowing  U.S. industries to inject slurries of toxic, potentially carcinogenic  compounds deep beneath the planet’s surface — as a means of “see no  evil” waste disposal — already sounds ridiculous, dangerous, and stupid  anyway without even going into further detail.</p>
<p>Alleged fracking links to the contamination of the public water  supply and critical aquifers, as well as ties to earthquake upticks near  drilling locations that are otherwise not prone to seismic activity  have created uproar in the years since the 2005 “<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kevin-grandia/how-cheneys-loophole-is-f_b_502924.html" target="_blank">Cheney loophole</a>,”  which allowed the industry to circumvent the Safe Drinking Water Act by  exempting fracking fluids, thus fast tracking shale fracking as a  source of cheap natural gas.</p>
<p>Now, it is apparent that the fracking industry is also privy to many  secrets of the nuclear energy industry and, specifically, where the  bodies are buried, err… dangerous nuclear waste is buried, rather —  waste that atomic researchers have otherwise found so difficult to  eliminate.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><a href="http://truthstreammedia.com/">TruthstreamMedia.com</a> uncovered several published newspaper accounts from the  Spring of 1964 concerning a then-newly disclosed plan to dump nuclear  waste produced by the atomic energy industry into hydraulic fracturing  (fracking) wells using a cement slurry technique developed by  Halliburton &amp; Co. The top two fracking companies in the nation at  the time were Halliburton and Dowell, a subsidiary of Dow Chemical.</p>
<p>And here we thought fracking was a relatively new industrial  phenomenon growing in popularity over just the last couple of decades.  Boy were we wrong. Revealed within these articles is Halliburton’s  long-standing relationship with the secret government and deep ties  between the oil and nuclear industries.</p>

</div>
<p>Teaming up with the U.S. Government and Union Carbide Corp., who  operate nuclear materials divisions at the Oak Ridge National  Laboratories in Tennessee, Halliburton was then credited with “solving”  the radioactive waste problem faced by America’s secretive nuclear  industry. Dumping waste via fracking had apparently been going on since  1960, according to the reports, but was only made public here in 1964.</p>
<p><b>Out of Sight, Out of Mind</b></p>
<p>Each of the articles Truthstream found carries the same account under  different headlines, with four of them using identical copy; and the  fifth, published in the <i>San Antonio Express</i>, slightly rewritten based  upon the same source information. The photo captions of each story also  add some useful tidbits:</p>

<p>and the June 15, 1964 edition of the <i>Denton Record Chronicle</i>.</p>
<p>The story read, in part:</p>
<div style="padding-left: 30px">
<a href="http://activistpost.net/stirlinggenerator.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-2EtoTLwyy5o/U5TGiSCMknI/AAAAAAAAAtE/oBbg4YDcpwY/s220/imgad1.gif"></a>Two techniques originated by the  petroleum industry for its own uses are expected to solve a major  problem in the development of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. The  problem is the disposal of dangerous, sometimes deadly, radioactive  waste by-products.</p>
<p>Researchers at Halliburton Co’s.  Technical Center here working with Oak Ridge National Laboratory  scientists, have combined the oil well cementing technique with the  hydraulic fracturing production stimulation technique to entomb  radioactive wastes in an impermeable shale formation a thousand feet  underground.</p>
<p>The method used at Oak Ridge begins by  mixing the waste with a cement slurry, pumping the mixture down a hole  drilled into the Conasuaga shale and then fracturing the shale to create  a horizontal crack. The crack fills with the mixture to form a thin,  horizontal sheet several hundred feet across. The mix sets to  permanently hold the radioactive waste in the formation.</p>
<p>Union Carbide Corp., which operates  facilities at Oak Ridge for the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, and  Halliburton, which provides specialized oil field services such as  cementing fracturing worldwide, have collaborated on the project since  1960.</p>
</div>
<p>The mix remained liquid for 48 hours before it was supposed to permanently set and remain there, entombed, forever.</p>
<p>The articles make clear that the Atomic Energy Commission was  preparing to use fracking as a means of disposing of nuclear wastes at  additional facilities, with Oak Ridge being simply one of the largest,  and the first to publicly disclose these out-of-sight disposal  procedures:</p>
<div style="padding-left: 30px">Oak Ridge has a radioactive waste  disposal problem typical of the nation’s nuclear sites. Each year about  four million gallons of waste, including such fission products as  strontium 90, cesium 137 and ruthenium 103, are generated at Oak Ridge.</p>
<p>Among the disposal methods already tried  have been dumping concrete-encased barrels of waste in the ocean or  burying the waste in lead-lined containers. These are considered either  too dangerous or too expensive or both.</p>
</div>
<p>
Unfortunately, the ocean has been used as a giant trashcan not only  by the nuclear industry, but municipal garbage and landfill companies  and many other entities as well, without any real concern about its  significant effects on the food supply and larger ecosystem of the  planet.</p>
<div style="padding-left: 30px">If this process is successful for  disposal of Oak Ridge National Laboratory intermediate-level wastes, it  has potential application at other atomic energy sites where suitable  geological conditions exist,” the Atomic Energy Commission says.
</div>
<p>The slightly different version in the San Antonio Express News added these details:</p>
<div style="padding-left: 30px">A couple of techniques used by oilmen  when they have hopes of production may soon be used by the Atomic Energy  Commission for – of all things – radioactive garbage disposal.</p>
<p>Final tests are now under way at Oak  Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, in trying a combination of oil  well cementing plus hydraulic fracturing to entomb radioactive wastes in  an impermeable shale formation a thousand feet underground.</p>
</div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both;text-align: center"><a href="https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/radioactive-fracking-Great_Bend_Tribune_Sun__Apr_19__1964_.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em;margin-right: 1em"><img alt="radioactive-fracking-Great_Bend_Tribune_Sun__Apr_19__1964_" class="wp-image-11708 size-large alignleft" src="https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/radioactive-fracking-Great_Bend_Tribune_Sun__Apr_19__1964_-384x1024.jpg"></a></div>
<p>Meanwhile, the <i>Great Bend Tribune </i>added information about the  Halliburton executives involved in the plan in their caption for a photo  which shows businessmen looking at a diagram explaining how nuclear  waste like strontium 90 is mixed with cement and injected into shale  formations:</p>
<div style="padding-left: 30px">Halliburton engineer Mack Stogner, left,  reviews the project with Harry P. Conroy, senior vice president and  general manager of the oil field service firm, and W.D. Owsley, senior  vice president.

<p>The process includes remote controlled operation of the hydraulic  fracturing drill in order to shield workers from the “medium level”  radioactive substances being dumped into the Earth’s crust, as the  Warren Times Mirror in Pennsylvania notes in the caption:</p>
<div style="padding-left: 30px">Disposing of Waste – Working behind  shielding and wearing film badges, Halliburton Company personnel use  demounted oil field service units to dispose of radioactive waste  generated at the Oak Ridge, Tenn. nuclear site.
</div>
<p>How often this procedure has been used at other facilities since then  is not entirely clear, though we know from reports discussed below that  the practice continued and there is no indication that it ever stopped.</p>
<p>Five years later, the October 22, 1969 edition of the <i>San Bernardino  County Sun</i> carried a report titled, “3 Ways to Manage Radioactive  Waste.”</p>
<p>It discussed the ongoing and growing problems with nuclear waste,  naming three principle strategies for managing the toxic stuff, summed  up as “(1) delay and decay, (2) concentrate and confine and (3) dilute  and disperse,” discussing how materials with lower half lives can  supposedly be safely sequestered and later dumped, while other materials  can be simply diluted and poured into existing groundwater supplies and  systems.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/teslasecret/" rel="nofollow" style="float: right;margin-left: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em"><img class="noshadow" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/_qLAIskTQXUc/TaqAcrCPlhI/AAAAAAAAISQ/5uq527jnmDM/book-shape.jpg" style="background:none;border:none" alt=""></a>The UPI story originating out of Oak Ridge states, in part,</p>
<div style="padding-left: 30px">Since the start of the atomic era in the  1940s, nuclear reactors around the nation have produced 75 million  gallons of hazardous high level radioactive waste materials.</p>
<p>And scientists here and elsewhere around  the nation still are wrestling with the problems of what to do with  this material, which promises to become even more plentiful as more and  more commercial nuclear reactors go into power production.</p>
</div>
<p>Oak Ridge proclaims that it found a solution to dealing with high level nuclear wastes, which has thus far been to keep it,</p>
<div style="padding-left: 30px">…buried a few feet underground in  storage tanks – tanks which must be periodically replaced because of the  natural deterioration of the steel and other materials of which they  are fabricated.</p>
<p>It is in this area of confining the high  level wastes, whose radioactive half life ranges up to 30 to 50 years,  that the Atomic Energy Commission is pushing dramatic new concepts.</p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px">
One disposal system, involving materials  in the medium range of radioactivity, is the hydraulic fracturing  procedures. This system is now being used at Oak Ridge and involves  mixing the liquid radioactive waste with concrete to form a grout which  is pumped into shale formations 500 to 800 feet underground.</div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px">
</div>
<p>Note, this article cites a shallower depth, at levels as shallow as  500 feet, after the 1964 articles claimed a further removed depth of  1,000 feet to 5,000. The even “higher level wastes” were disposed of in  abandoned salt mines, according to Oak Ridge.<b> </b></p>
<p><b>Nuclear Waste ‘Safely Flushed Away’ into the Water Supply</b></p>
<p>The 1969 article states that “low level waste” is “material which can  safely be flushed away into rivers and lakes or released into the  atmosphere because the level of radioactivity is so low that is presents  no hazard when diluted and flushed into man’s natural environment. The  more difficult problem is involved in the high level, liquid and solid  wastes which are produced in the reprocessing of used fuel elements from  nuclear reactor cores.”</p>
<p>The idea that the waste dumped into water supplies was so “low level”  as to be completely harmless is likely dubious and hopeful at best.  Fluoride, a by-product of the nuclear power industry, was one of those  constituents, and was transformed from being known as a rat poison to  being known as a dental benefit by the original spin doctor and  propagandist, Edward Bernays.</p>
<p>In his book <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1583227008/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1583227008&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=truthmedia-20&amp;linkId=GW7NBSLKQ4MRPUMZ">The Fluoride Deception</a></i>,  author Christopher Bryson revealed how the nuclear industry also used  fluoridation of the public water supply as a means of secretly dumping  industrial waste after fluoride was a major by-product in the uranium  enrichment process for building the atomic bomb. <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2004/6/17/the_fluoride_deception_how_a_nuclear" target="_blank">Bryson told Democracy Now</a>:</p>
<div style="padding-left: 30px">
<b>The Manhattan Project needed fluoride to enrich uranium.</b>  That’s how they did it. The biggest industrial building in the world,  for a time, was the fluoride gaseous diffusion plant in Tennessee the  Manhattan Project and Dr. Hodge as the senior toxicologist for the  Manhattan Project, were scared stiff less that workers would realize  that the fluoride they were going to be breathing inside these plants  was going to injury them and that the Manhattan Project, the key — the  key of U.S. Strategic power in the Cold War Era, would be jeopardized  because the Manhattan Project and the industrial contractors making the  atomic bomb would be facing all these lawsuits from workers, all these  lawsuits from farmers living around these industrial plants and so  Harold Hodge assures us that fluoride is safe and good for children.
</div>
<p>More recently, an <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/radioactive-leaks-found-at-75-of-us-nuke-sites/" target="_blank">Associated Press investigation</a>  found in 2011 that 48 of 65 nuclear sites in the United States were  leaking tritium, a radioactive form of hydrogen, into groundwater  supplies via corroded pipes and tunnels. AP found at least 37 locations  were in direct violation of federal drinking water standards for  tritium, in some cases hundreds of times over.</p>

<p>Scientists who work for these corporations have used computer  modeling to assure the Environmental Protection Agency that this waste  poses no threat to our aquifers and that layers of rock deep within the  Earth would safely store this stuff like Tupperware for millennia.</p>
<p>Already, several incidents have proven that scientific computer models are no match for reality.</p>
<p>It is clear from a December 21, 1973 article that disposal of nuclear  waste via fracking continued, along with promises that it would be safe  for millions of years to come.</p>
<p>The <i>Dixon Evening Telegraph</i> wrote in “Geologists look at energy crunch”:</p>
<div style="padding-left: 30px">The U.S. Government is disposing of  approximately 250,000 gallons of intermediate-level wastes each year  using a technique called hydraulic fracturing. Liquids are pumped into  impervious shales 1,000 to 5,000 feet below the surface. High pressure  is applied causing the rocks to fracture and the liquid moves out  laterally. <b>Because the rock and radioactive wastes it contains will not be exposed to the biosphere for millions of years, this method should be safe unless leakage into an overlying aquifer occurs.</b>
</div>
<p>That is, as the article points out, <i>unless</i> there are leaks.</p>
<p>As we found in research, leakage is exactly what has happened time  and again throughout the years, including at disposal sites for Oak  Ridge National Laboratories, according to reports in the following  cases. Via <a href="http://www.propublica.org/article/injection-wells-the-poison-beneath-us" target="_blank">ProPublica</a>:</p>
<div style="padding-left: 30px">In April, 1967 pesticide waste injected by a chemical plant at Denver’s Rocky Mountain Arsenal destabilized a seismic fault, <a href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/states/colorado/history.php">causing a magnitude 5.0 earthquake</a>  — strong enough to shatter windows and close schools — and jolting  scientists with newfound risks of injection, according to the U.S.  Geological Survey.</p>
<p>A year later, a corroded hazardous waste  well for pulping liquor at the Hammermill Paper Co., in Erie, Pa.,  ruptured. Five miles away, <a href="http://www.propublica.org/documents/item/371069-study-uic-class1-study-risks-class1">according to an EPA report</a>, “a noxious black liquid seeped from an abandoned gas well” in Presque Isle State Park.</p>

</div>
<p>In 1975 in <a href="http://www.propublica.org/documents/item/371259-epa-effect-of-uic-regulation-study-uic-effect">Beaumont, Texas</a>, dioxin and a highly acidic herbicide injected underground by the <a href="http://www.propublica.org/documents/item/355342-1985-report-uic-regulatory-oversightpb85185916">Velsicol Chemical Corp.</a>  burned a hole through its well casing, sending as much as five million  gallons of the waste into a nearby drinking water aquifer.</p>
</div>
<p>And these are hardly the only examples… in fact, it is just  scratching the surface of an issue that is almost as incomprehensible as  it is unfathomable.</p>
<div style="padding-left: 30px">
<b>Then in August 1984 in Oak Ridge, Tenn., <a href="http://www.propublica.org/documents/item/371260-ornl-oak-ridge-injection-research-paper-5834126">radioactive waste was turned</a> up by water monitoring near a deep injection well at a government nuclear facility.</b>
</div>
<p><i>Bingo…</i></p>
<p>There it is. The infallible, permanent, and “impermeable” deep  injection wells that Halliburton and the Atomic Energy Commission  considered as a solution to nuclear waste for eons to come were found  turning up radioactive nuclear waste at the very Oak Ridge site where  these 1960s disposal projects were taking place.</p>
<p><b>Subterranean Waste Disposal a ‘Cornerstone of the Nation’s Economy’</b></p>
<p>Those cemented wells, filled with injected disposal substances may be  safely secured for a few years or even decades, but that is no  guarantee for the years down the road and its certainly not the millennia  as promised by Halliburton and others in the industry. In fact, many of  the wells have been forgotten, abandoned, and are lost to the record  books.</p>
<p>As <a href="http://www.propublica.org/article/injection-wells-the-poison-beneath-us" target="_blank">ProPublica reports</a>:</p>
<div style="padding-left: 30px">There are upwards of 2 million <a href="http://www.propublica.org/documents/item/371056-iogcc-abandoned-well-paper-2008-protecting-our">abandoned and plugged oil and gas wells</a>  in the U.S., more than 100,000 of which may not appear in regulators’  records. Sometimes they are just broken off tubes of steel, buried or  sticking out of the ground. Many are supposed to be sealed shut with  cement, but studies show that cement breaks down over time, allowing  seepage up the well structure.
</div>
<p>And many of these are injection wells, where all kinds of unwanted,  toxic substances are dumped in order to be forgotten… though not  necessarily gone.</p>
<p>Not only are these practices taking place, they are widespread… and  widely defended, even with the known failures and safety issues.</p>
<div style="padding-left: 30px">Many scientists and regulators say the  alternatives to the injection process — burning waste, treating  wastewater, recycling, or disposing of waste on the surface — are far  more expensive or bring additional environmental risks.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/backyardliberty.html" rel="nofollow" style="float: right;margin-left: 1em;margin-bottom: 0em"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-S6RfjP7Lvo8/USlEmRqWjJI/AAAAAAAAUgk/Zio_5z2T_gE/s200/prep.gif" alt=""></a><b>Subterranean waste disposal, they  point out, is a cornerstone of the nation’s economy, relied on by the  pharmaceutical, agricultural and chemical industries.</b> It’s also critical to a future less dependent on foreign oil: Hydraulic fracturing, “clean coal” technologies, <b>nuclear fuel production</b>  and carbon storage (the keystone of the strategy to address climate  change) all count on pushing waste into rock formations below the  earth’s surface. (<a href="http://www.propublica.org/article/injection-wells-the-poison-beneath-us" target="_blank">source</a>)</p>
</div>
<p>
Sure, maybe it’s better than dumping it directly into the waterways,  but still. This isn’t just playing with fire, this is playing with the  lives of everyone in the nation for generations to come.</p>
<p>Please read ProPublica’s full series of reports on this, <a href="http://www.propublica.org/article/injection-wells-the-poison-beneath-us" target="_blank">starting here</a>. Things have to change.</p>
<p>These people should not have started messing with something they did not know how to fully and safely manage.</p>
<p>How long can this madness continue until it winds up tainting every drinking glass in America?</p>
<p>Engineer Mario Salazar, who worked as a technical expert for 25 years  with the EPA’s underground injection program in Washington, told  ProPublica’s Abrahm Lustgarten something that should give us all pause  about how radioactive nuclear waste and industrial pollutants in general  are being handled, and where they may ultimately end up:</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">

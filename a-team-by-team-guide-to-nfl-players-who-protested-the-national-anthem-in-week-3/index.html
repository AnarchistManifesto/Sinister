<p><strong>(<a href="https://shadowproof.com/2017/09/25/team-team-guide-nfl-players-protested-national-anthem-week-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SP</a>)</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400">— </span>During the third week of the National Football League season, the NFL responded to President Donald Trump’s comments slurring players, who take a knee during the national anthem to protest injustice, police brutality, and systemic racism. The owners and coaches linked arms to show Trump he would not divide them. But there were several players, who took stronger action and continued to engage in the tactic of taking a knee.</p>
<p>Taking a knee started with San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick during the 2016 preseason. He declared, “I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color. To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.” (He was referring to police who gun down black men and face nearly zero consequences for their actions.)</p>
<p>NFL owners blackballed Kaepernick. Several of them, including owners who stood with players on Sunday, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2017/09/24/how-much-money-nfl-owners-have-donated-donald-trump/698256001/">donated</a> to Trump’s inaugural committee or his presidential campaign.</p>
<p>A very small percentage of players were willing to step out before Trump made his comments, but he agitated the entire league and pushed many to take action beyond calling Trump indecent. For example, both the Seahawks and the Raiders took bold stands as teams that hinged upon tolerance and resistance to racism. Dolphins players even went so far as to warm up in shirts that said “#IMWITHKAP.”</p>
<p>Below is a guide to all the individual players, who took action, along with a record of how each team responded to Trump’s comments.</p>

<h2>Arizona Cardinals</h2>
<p><em>Players Who Took a Knee</em>: No players <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/20819786/dallas-cowboys-arizona-cardinals-lock-arms-monday-night-football-game">took</a> a knee.</p>
<p><em>Players Who Sat</em>: None reported.</p>
<p><em>Players Who Locked Arms</em>: Most of the team locked arms and the linking of arms even included members of the military, which seemed directed at fans who continue to insist this is about the flag when it is really about racism and inequality.</p>
<p><em>Did Owner(s) Join Them?</em>: No, but the general manager and president were both present to stand with the team.</p>
<h2>Atlanta Falcons</h2>
<p><em>Players Who Took a Knee</em>: Two players, defensive linemen Grady Jarrett and Dontari Poe, <a href="http://www.11alive.com/sports/nfl/atlanta-falcons/falcons-players-kneel-for-the-first-time-during-anthem-following-trumps-comments/478249433">took</a> a knee. It was the first time Falcons players knelt during the anthem.</p>
<p><em>Players Who Sat</em>: None reported.</p>
<p><em>Players Who Locked Arms</em>: Most of the team.</p>
<p><em>Did Owner(s) Join Them?</em>: Yes, Arthur Blank <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/nfl-owners-stand-players-trump-kneeling-rebuke/story?id=50060482">locked arms</a> with wide receiver Julio Jones and running back Devonta Freeman.</p>
<p><em>Player Statements</em>: “My spirit moved me in a way, and it was on my mind,” Jarrett <a href="http://www.espn.com/blog/atlanta-falcons/post/_/id/29115/falcons-grady-jarrett-dontari-poe-might-keep-taking-knee-during-anthem">said</a>. “It was on my mind, man. And it’s definitely something that it’s so awesome because of having the support of your brothers, man, and a supportive organization like this. It’s truly a blessing. I’m just thankful.”</p>
<p>Poe stated, “I just felt like as a man, it was something I should do. No matter what’s going on, if I can do something to help in any kind of way, that was the way that I chose. And I did it.” He added, “It’s more about being together as people try to divide you. Strength in numbers; strength in yourself. I felt like it was more of my duty to do it.”</p>
<h2>Baltimore Ravens</h2>
<p><em>Players Who Took A Knee:</em> Wide receiver Mike Wallace, linebackers C.J. Moseley, Za’Darius Smith, and Terrell Suggs, defensive tackle Carl Davis, and defensive backs Tony Jefferson, Anthony Levine Sr., and Lardarius Webb <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/bs-md-ravens-kneel-fans-20170924-story.html">took</a> a knee. It was the first time any Ravens player protested during the anthem. (They were joined by former Ravens player Ray Lewis, who is an honorary captain.)</p>
<p><em>Players Who Sat</em>: None reported.</p>
<p><em>Players Who Locked Arms</em>: Most of the team.</p>
<p><em>Did The Owner(s) Join Them?</em>: No.</p>
<p><em>Player Statements: </em>“Personally, I think the comments made about my brothers who decided to protest and kneel is kind of what made us no longer be silent,” Suggs <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/20800784/nfl-players-coaches-owners-kneel-lock-arms-national-anthem">stated</a>. “We stand with our brothers. They have the right to protest. We knelt with them today. Nonviolent protest is as American as it gets. We knelt with them today, and let them know we are a unified front. There is no dividing us. I guess we’re all sons of bitches.”</p>
<h2>Buffalo Bills</h2>
<p><em>Players Who Took A Knee:</em> Wide receivers Kaelin Clay and Jordan Matthews, running back Taiwan Jones, fullback Mike Tolbert, defensive ends Ryan Davis and Shaq Lawson, linebacker Lorenzo Alexander, cornerbacks Shareece Wright and Leonard Johnson, defensive tackles Marcell Dareus and Cedric Thornton <a href="http://buffalonews.com/2017/09/24/lesean-mccoy-shaq-lawson-among-several-bills-protest-national-anthem/">took</a> a knee.</p>

(And I) don’t want to ask someone else to do anything for me. I just thought it was appropriate to stay in because we know what went on this week with the comments that were made by the President. I felt like he attacked our brothers, my brothers in the league. So I felt like it was appropriate to stand up with them and stay in the locker room.”</p>

For me personally, I love this country,” Eifert <a href="http://www.cincinnati.com/story/sports/nfl/bengals/2017/09/24/cincinnati-bengals-lock-arms-during-national-anthem/698052001/">declared</a>. “The national anthem has always been one of my favorite parts before a game. You are sitting here on a sideline. They are standing on that sideline. We have thousands of troops that have died, and we are sitting here to recognize that and I’m sitting here all nervous because we are going to play a game. There are people over there dying for us. It just kind of brings me back down to Earth that it really isn’t that big of a deal to be here playing a football game when there are people doing a lot more important stuff. It’s a good time to pay tribute to them.”</p>

We couldn’t just let things go.” He also added, “It was for our brothers who have been attacked for things they do during the game.”</p>

Of course I’m focused on the game and everything, but in the back of my mind, I’m thinking, ‘What should I do in this situation?’ It was really a game-time decision. It’s hard, being a rookie. It’s hard. I had to think long and hard about it, because there’s a lot that can come with that.”</p>

It was disrespectful. Him being in that position, obviously, he shouldn’t be, I would say one of the most divisive people in the country. We wanted to show unity, locking arms. With the guys that felt the need to make some kind of stand, make a protest, that’s what we did<em>.”<br />

<p>“So, as a man, as a father, as an African-American man, as somebody in the NFL and as one of those ‘sons of bitches,’ yeah, I took it personally, but at the same time, it’s bigger than me. I’ve got a daughter. She’s going to have to live in this world. I’m going to do whatever I got to do to make sure she can look at her dad and be like, ‘Hey, you did something, you tried to make a change.’”</p>

This is kind of an ongoing problem, and we’re making a statement about that. It might seem that way that it was kind of a reaction to the President, but this stuff’s been going on for a long time.”</p>
<h2>Philadelphia Eagles</h2>
<p><em>Players Who Took A Knee</em>: None reported, but linebacker Mychal Kendricks did choose to <a href="http://www.nj.com/eagles/index.ssf/2017/09/nfl_protests_trump_eagles_giants.html">stand by himself</a>instead of linking arms.</p>

<p><em>Did The Owner(s) Join Them?</em>: Yes, owner Jeffrey Lurie linked arms with players.</p>
<h2>Pittsburgh Steelers</h2>
<p>Coach Mike Tomlin was very adamant and insistent that players would <a href="http://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2017/09/24/steelers-skip-national-anthem/">all do the same thing</a> during the anthem. He appeared to make a decision to keep all players in the locker room to prevent individual players from expressing themselves in ways that might upset other players and create “distractions” from the game.</p>
<p>That did not stop offensive tackle Alejandro Villanueva, a military veteran, from leaving the locker room early to stand at the tail end with his hand on his heart. That upset Tomlin, because it undermined the purpose of staying in the locker room. Tomlin’s anger was crudely construed by conservative media as a sleight against a military veteran.</p>
<h2>San Francisco 49ers</h2>
<p>The team played Thursday night before Donald Trump made remarks.</p>
<h2>Seattle Seahawks</h2>
<p>All players <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/352165-seahawks-and-titans-to-remain-in-locker-rooms-during-national">remained</a> in the locker room during the anthem and issued the following statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a team, we have decided we will not participate in the national anthem. We will not stand for the injustice that has plagued people of color in this country. Out of love for our country and in honor of the sacrifices made on our behalf, we unite to oppose those that would deny our most basic freedoms. We remain committed in continuing to work towards equality and justice for all. Respectfully, the players of the Seattle Seahawks.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Tampa Bay Buccaneers</h2>

<p><em>Players Who Sat</em>: None reported.</p>
<p><em>Players Who Locked Arms</em>: Most players linked arms during the anthem.</p>
<p><em>Did The Owner(s) Join Them?</em>: No</p>
<h2>Tennessee Titans</h2>
<p>All team players remained in the locker room. Like the Steelers, the goal was more to ensure different players did not have to deal with whether they should take a certain action or not.</p>
<p>In a statement, they <a href="http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2017/09/24/seahawks-titans-release-statements-about-not-participating-in-anthem/">declared</a>: “As a team, we wanted to be unified in our actions today. The players jointly decided this was the best course of action. Our commitment to the military and our community is resolute and the absence of our team for the national anthem shouldn’t be misconstrued as unpatriotic.”</p>
<p>But it created an eerie scene in the Seahwaks-Titans game, where there were no players on the field during the anthem.</p>
<h2>Washington Redskins</h2>
<p><em>Players Who Took A Knee</em>: Wide receivers Jamison Crowder, Josh Doctson, and Brian Quick, tight ends Niles Paul and Jordan Reed, and linebackers Ryan Anderson and Chris Carter <a href="http://www.espn.com/blog/nflnation/post/_/id/249755/nfl-players-who-protested-during-the-national-anthem-in-week-3">took</a> a knee.</p>

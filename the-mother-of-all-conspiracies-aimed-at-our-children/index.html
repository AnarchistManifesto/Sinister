<b><a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2013/08/we-are-from-hhs-and-were-here-to-help.html">Activist Post</a></b></p>
<p>There is presently a massive conspiracy designed to separate you from your children and give the government complete control over your children. To put it simply, Health and Human Services (HHS)  and their state level emissary, Children Protective Services (CPS) are engaged in a conspiracy which will culminate in (1) the Agenda 21 designed breakdown of the family; (2) the eradication of any semblance of parental authority over children; and, (3) unbridled and unfettered access to seizing children from the home in unlimited quantities for whatever nefarious purposes which might dictate the volume of child seizures.</p>
<div>
<b>The International Plot Begins with the UN</b>
</div>
<div>
</div>
<div>This program emanates from a partnership between various United Nations organizations and ICF, acting on behalf of HHS, CPS and Obamacare (i.e. The Affordable Health Care Act). The evidence in this article, along with the included links, will demonstrate that when Obamacare is fully operational, our families, specifically our children will be living in a Romanian type of a Ceausescu hellish nightmare.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>Romanian dictator, Nicolae Ceausescu, seized hundreds of thousands of children from stable families under the pretense that these children had disabilities which could only be treated by the government. In reality, this madman planned to use the seized children, raised in government orphanages, for military and state purposes. Three hundred thousand children were raised in these state run orphanages (Romanian encyclopedia.adoption.com). Had Ceausescu survived, the vast majority of these children would have been useless to him because there were functionally retarded due to severe neglect.</p>
<p>After reviewing HHS, CPS and UN documents I have no doubt that Obamacare has the same goals and intentions as Ceausescu. What is being presently reported in the alternative media is merely the tip of the iceberg with regard to HHS’ intentions toward the ultimate outcome of the children in this country. After reviewing the documents, there is no doubt that Obama is representing international interests which will seek to remove as many children as possible from the homes of their parents in the spirit of Ceausescu. I freely admit that what I am about to reveal here has made me lose sleep and for the first time contemplate the real possibility of a revolution against the bankers who have hijacked our government. I cannot see parents submitting to this tyranny without a fight.</p>
<p>But first let me quickly review the recent revelations of the HHS/CPS/Obamacare intention to conduct what I have dubbed as “home invasion interventions.”</p>

<p>
<b>Obamacare Home Invasions and Interventions</b></p>
<p>According to a previously unreported Obamacare regulation, that has managed to escape “scrutiny” from the mainstream media, millions of American families will be targeted for home invasion by the forces of the Federal government in the name of preventing parental neglect resulting in disabilities in their children. And the Fourth Amendment be damned, after January 1, 2014, Federal officials may enter your home without a warrant in order to “intervene” for the purpose of saving “high risk” children.</p>
<p><b>Obamacare’s Definition of High Risk</b></p>
<p>The exposure of the extreme and intrusive nature of Obamacare through home invasions is finally seeing the light of day in the alternative media. However, this exposure is grossly understated. As a starting point, I will briefly review what is making the rounds in the alternative media. According to <a href="https://grants3.hrsa.gov/2010/Web2External/Interface/FundingCycle/ExternalView.aspx?&amp;fCycleID=9E7EA909-4562-4FBE-86DA-D5F383C3ACFB&amp;ViewMode=EU&amp;GoBack=&amp;PrintMode=&amp;OnlineAvailabilityFlag=True&amp;pageNumber=1">Human Health Services</a>, your family is eligible for this Soviet-style “intervention” in the following situations:</p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<li>Families where mom is not yet 21.</li>
<li>Families where someone is a tobacco user.</li>
<li>Families where children have low student achievement, developmental delays, or disabilities.</li>
<li>Families with individuals who are serving or formerly served in the armed forces, including such families that have members of the armed forces who have had multiple deployments outside the United States.</li>
<li>Although this is not being widely reported, homeschoolers and their families will be targeted for “interventions” as will be families who object to having their children take vaccines.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/homeschoolguide.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" class="noshadow" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/_qLAIskTQXUc/TW61gkmHYeI/AAAAAAAAHPQ/fMnfpZ7Y9So/book1.png" style="border: none;background:none"></a>There is no question that all of the above categories will warrant a home invasion followed by “remediation.”  The visits will not be conducted by HHS officials as has been reported in several publications. The home invasion visits will be <a href="https://www.childwelfare.gov/pubs/usermanuals/neglect/neglect.pdf">conducted</a> by CPS on behalf of HHS.</p>
<p>HHS has designed a detailed 110-page policy <a href="https://www.childwelfare.gov/pubs/usermanuals/neglect/neglect.pdf">manual</a> which focuses on the criteria constituting child neglect. This policy manual which is the guide created by HHS for CPS’ home intervention visits makes the above criteria, presently being reported in the alternative media, look tame by comparison.</p>
<p><b>HHS, CPS and the Criminalization of Parenthood</b></p>
<p>In the 110-page HHS/CPS manual, the variables which comprise child neglect worthy of government intervention is frightening beyond any words I can find to express their undisguised intentions. This entire document which will serve as the field manual by CPS in support of Obamacare undermines parental authority to a level that is beyond belief.</p>
<p>How many of you were ever grounded by your parents and not permitted to play outside with your friends? This is now illegal under the HHS/CPS policy manual. They label the treatment as neglect by isolation. There are no time frames set forth which constitute isolation, and it is left to the field representative. This obviously erodes parental discipline.</p>
<p>If your child is judged to be underachieving in school, this is referred to as educational neglect and is worthy of governmental intervention. Further, if your child is absent for five days in any one month from school, the same allegation would be made against the parent.</p>
<p>If your child has ADD or ADHD, you could be accused of neglect because the document details how this can be somehow caused by poor nutrition, although the variables associated with the cause are not specified.</p>
<p>The document goes out of its way to specify that poverty and neglect are not inextricably linked. Then the document goes out of its way to link poverty with child neglect. Read between the lines America. As we already are aware, many poor children who go missing from scandals such The Second Mile Foundation, The Franklin Scandal and the latest with the 78 missing wards of the state in Oklahoma, frequently end up being put into child sex trafficking rings operated and funded by such notables as DynCorp and HSBC bank.</p>
<p>Of course no Obama-inspired program would be complete without an attack upon the Second Amendment. Obamacare is no exception, as one of the criteria for child neglect  are parents who are also gun owners.    </p>
<p>The presence of alcohol in the home is a trigger for an allegation of neglect and subsequent “intervention.” Of course, alcoholic parents can present a clear-and-present danger to a child’s well-being. However, in the policy manual the conditions for concern over alcohol do not detail the amount and percentage of the family resources involved necessary to obtain alcohol. In other words, one can of beer in the home can be considered to constitute child neglect by the Obamacare CPS fieldworker.</p>
<p>If your child has engages in any type of <a href="https://www.childwelfare.gov/pubs/usermanuals/neglect/neglect.pdf">illicit or criminal behavior</a>, your family is at risk. Raise your hands if you ever smoked pot before the age of 18, or drank as a teen, or engaged in any kind of sexual activity before the age of 18, ever stayed out past curfew, or ever shoplifted? IF your children ever engage in these and a multitude of other transgressions, you are in danger of losing your children. This also means that if your child is ever involved in a fight in school or is assigned detention, the school will be required to report the behavior to the HHS/CPS and you can expect to have a “home invasion intervention” session with your friendly Obamacare CPS fieldworker.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/familysurvival.html" rel="nofollow" style="float: right;margin-left: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ASIFGy_z7zU/UCFiDQK8GBI/AAAAAAAAROU/7AHejVY_hUE/s202/3.gif"></a>If you are ever late picking up your child from daycare or from school aftercare, you will be reported.</p>
<p>If you have ever been depressed or have been treated for any mental disorder (e.g. PTSD, anxiety, etc.), you are at risk for losing your children.</p>
<p>Even illegal immigrant families are not immune from this insanity. Children are judged by the field worker to not be fully acculturated, do not properly speak the language, exhibits signs of being homesick and judged to have not formed an unspecified number of friends and formed a cohesive social network, allegations of neglect can be made.</p>
<p>I could literally write 10 more pages on what CPS/HHS, on behalf of Obamacare, considers to be parental neglect. I would invite the reader to spend some time reviewing the <a href="https://www.childwelfare.gov/pubs/usermanuals/neglect/neglect.pdf">document</a> which will be serving as the policy manual for the forced home inspections. Please note that when the reader gets beyond the flowery language and professed concern for children, that the language is written so broadly that virtually any human condition, any family circumstance or child’s behavior can be interpreted as child neglect.</p>
<p>The important thing to note is the use of language by this manual. Parents who are deemed by an Obamacare CPS field worker, operating under the HHS flag, to be neglectful towards their children are considered to have created “disabilities” within their children. As the reader will soon discover, the use of the term “disabilities” is key to understanding how far this administration is willing to go to seize children for some nefarious purpose.</p>
<p>Sadly, this is still only the beginning. There is far more to be concerned about beginning with who is ultimately responsible for these outrages.</p>
<p><b>Meet the Creators of the State Sponsored Child Kidnapping Rings</b></p>
<p>The primary author for this insane manual for HHS/CPS and their designed home invasion interventions is Diane DePanfilis, Ph.D., M.S.W.  She is the Associate Dean for. Research and an Associate Professor of Social Work at the University of Maryland.  More importantly she is a co-editor of the <i>Handbook on Child Protection Practice</i>. In other words, DePanfilis has been a major player in the unconstitutional practices we see in CPS in all 50 states. As if this is not concerning enough, all of the other contributing authors have their professional origins and affiliations with the same organization.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lindsay Ritter Taylor      from Caliber, an  ICF  International Company</li>
<li>Matthew Shuman, M.S.W,  A consultant with Caliber, an ICF International Company</li>
<li>Jean  Strohl,  A consultant with Caliber, an ICF International Company,</li>
<li>Jeannie Newman, M.S.W,  M.I.B.S.,  A consultant with Caliber, an ICF International Company</li>
</ul>
<p>It was at this point, I smelled a rat. We have the primary author being a CPS author designed to teach their field operatives on the methods of how to abuse parents and undermine parental authority. And all of the contributing authors come from the exact same corporation, ICF. At this point, it is prudent to ask the question, who is ICF?</p>
<p><b>ICF Is the Biggest Player That You Have Never Heard Of</b></p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>ICF International partners with government and commercial clients to deliver consulting services and technology solutions in climate change, energy, environment, transportation, social programs, defense, and homeland security markets. In my mind, this established ICF as a major player in the introduction and implementation of the globalist agenda by designing matching Federal programs. And as it turned out they are a major player in Obamacare through their subsidiary acquisition, Caliber Associates.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/backyardliberty.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 0em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-quNsfpdF1Y4/URWUid2cbqI/AAAAAAAAUIk/1Of8oOtlU6k/s200/imgad200.gif"></a>Caliber is an “established leader in providing research, consulting, and innovation in human services and human resource issues.” ICF acquired Caliber in 2005 in order “to serve HHS, the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Department of Defense, and the U.S. Department of Education.”  Caliber Associates and their four contributing authors to the HHS/CPS field manual, which will be used to enforce child welfare regulations, was the undeniable link to Obamacare through this field manual. But as I discovered, the rabbit hole went even deeper.</p>
<p>After I found the co-authors of the HHS/CPS policy manual which will guide these forced home inspections, I smelled the distinct odor of the United Nations and Agenda 21 and sure enough, this was exactly what I found.</p>
<p><b>The United Nations and Obamacare</b></p>

</div>
<p>At times, I feel that I have the globalist playbook and I am able to often anticipate their next move. Please allow me to briefly illustrate how the globalists have operated in another area, education, and then draw the parallel to how the UN is deeply involved in Obamacare.</p>
<p>The Common Core Curriculum, which is sweeping the nation’s education system, was the product of “Education for All.”  Education for All comes from the United Nations education arm, the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). Common Core went from UNESCO to the National Governors Association who in turn farmed out the development of the details to various NGO’s, which in turn sent the standards to each state for implementation. This is the standard model that the globalists follow when implementing a controversial program and Obamacare follows a similar pattern as did Common Core.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that the provisions of allegedly protecting children in Obamacare, originated with the United Nations.</p>
<p>In the United Nations document entitled, <a href="http://www.academia.edu/1279003/Human_Rights_Persons_with_Disabilities_ICF_and_the_UN_Convention_on_the_rights_of_persons_with_disabilities_-_Training_toolkit">Human Rights, Persons with Disabilities, ICF and the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (Training toolkit)</a>, implementation for programs designed to help people, children in particular, with disabilities, came from the World Health Organization (WHO) [Page  36], UNESCO [Page 37], the International Labour Organization (ILO) [Page 36] and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF)[Page 38]. As one can see from the title, ICF and the UN have partnered to protect people/children with disabilities.</p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p>Please remember that earlier in the article, I made the point that the HHS/CPS field manual referred to neglected children as children who have disabilities. It is quite apparent that any of the conditions listed in the HHS/CPS manual will produce children who have disabilities. And in the case of Ceausescu, in which he seized hundreds of thousands of children who had “disabilities” and planned to use them for purposes of the state, the same picture is beginning to emerge with regard to Obamacare and the home invasion visits. I can draw no other conclusion than Obamacare is State-sponsored child slavery.</p>
<p>Under Obamacare, virtually every aspect of parenting is criminalized. Any child can be considered to have a disability for which the State is the only legitimate treatment source. When Obama was first running for President in 2008, he promised to build a civilian security force that “was just as strong, just as well-funded as our military.” And when one combines this conspiracy with Obama’s Executive Order 13603 which calls for a mandatory civilian conscription to complement a military draft, it is clear that this lunatic is planning to enslave a large segment of the population, and he will obtain many of his conscripts from Obamacare. And many of you who are familiar with Agenda 21 and their expressed views toward parental rights and the rights of children, do not need me to connect the dots, you already have done so.</p>
<p>My advice to all parents: don’t answer the door on New Year’s Day 2014 when Obamacare begins to be implemented.  </p>

<a href="http://www.caseyresearch.com/go/bwCm0/ATP"><b>Casey Research</b></a></p>
<p>Goldman Sachs has lowered its gold price projections and says the  metal is headed to $1,200. Credit Suisse and UBS are bearish. Citigroup  says the gold bull market is over.</p>
<p>So I guess it’s time to pack it in, right?</p>
<p>Not so fast. As we’ve written before, <a href="http://www.caseyresearch.com/go/bwCm0/CSR" target="_blank">these types of analysts have been consistently wrong</a>  about gold throughout this bull cycle. Another reason to disagree,  however, is history; we’ve seen this movie before. In the middle of one  of the greatest gold bull markets in modern history – the one that  culminated in the 1980 peak – gold experienced a 20-month, one-way  decline. Every time it seemed to stabilize, the bottom would fall out  again. From December 30, 1974 to August 25, 1976, gold fell a whopping  47%.</p>
<p>1976 had to be a tough year for gold investors. The price had  already been declining for a year – and it just kept on sinking. Since  that’s similar to what we’re experiencing today, I wondered, <i>What were the pundits were saying then? </i>I wanted to find out.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>I  enlisted the help of two local librarians, along with my wife and son,  to dig up some quotes from that year. It wasn’t easy, because  publications weren’t in digital form yet, and electronic searches had  limited success. But we did uncover some nuggets I thought you might  find interesting.</p>
<p>The context for that year is that the IMF had  three major gold auctions from June to September, dumping a lot of gold  onto the market. Both the US and the Soviet Union were also selling gold  at the time. It was no secret that the US was trying to remove gold  from the monetary system; direct convertibility of the dollar to gold  had ended on August 15, 1971.</p>

<p>
The public statements below were all  made in 1976. You’ll see that they aren’t all necessarily bearish, but I  included a range to give a sense of what was happening at the time,  especially regarding the mood of the gold market. I think you’ll agree  that much of this sounds awfully darn familiar. I couldn’t resist making  a few comments of my own, too.</p>
<p>To highlight the timing, I put the  comments into a price chart, pinpointing when they were said relative  to the market. Keep in mind as you read them that <b>the gold price bottomed on August 25, and then began a three-and-a-half year, 721% climb…</b></p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<b>[1]</b> “For the moment at least, the party seems to be over.” <i>New York Times</i>, March 26.</p>
<p><b>[2]</b>  “Though happily out of the precious metal, Mr. Heim is no more bullish  on the present state of the stock market than any of the unreconstructed  gold bugs he’s had so much fun twitting of late. He’s urging his  clients to put their money into Treasury bills.” <i>New York Times</i>, March 26.</p>
<p>Me:  These comments remind me of those today who poke fun at gold investors.  I wonder if Mr. Heim was still “twitting” a couple years later?</p>
<p><b>[3]</b> “‘It’s a seller’s market. No one is buying gold,’ a dealer in Zurich said.” <i>New York Times</i>, July 20.<br />
Turns  out this would’ve been an incredible buyer’s market – but only for  those with the courage to buy more when gold dropped still lower before  taking off again.</p>
<p><b>[4]</b> “Though the price recovered  to $111 by week’s end, that is still a dismal figure for gold bugs, who  not long ago were forecasting prices of $300 or more.” <i>Time</i> magazine, August 2.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/gold2013.html" rel="nofollow" style="float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-yIQ_BrkDXTA/URRNR7Zws8I/AAAAAAAAUE8/TeCrn7B_G9M/s180/2013goldguide_180x150.gif"></a>The “gold bugs” were eventually right; gold hit $300 almost exactly three years later, a 170% rise.</p>
<p><b>[5]</b>  “Meanwhile, the economic conditions that triggered the gold boom of  1973 through 1974, have largely disappeared. The dollar is steady, world  inflation rates have come down, and the general panic set off by the  oil crisis has abated. All those trends reduce the distrust of paper  money that moves many speculators to put their funds in gold.” <i>Time</i> magazine, August 2.</p>
<p>This  view ended up being shortsighted, as these conditions all reversed  before the decade was over. Does this sound similar to pundits today  claiming the reasons for buying gold have disappeared?</p>
<p><b>[6] </b>“Our  own predictions are that gold will go below $100, with some hesitation  possible at the $100 level.” As stated by Mr. Heim in the August 19 <i>New York Times</i>.</p>
<p>Yes, this is the same gentleman as #2 above. I wonder how many of his clients were still with him a few years later?</p>
<p><b>[7]</b>  “Currently, Mr. LaLoggia has this to say: ‘There is simply nothing in  the economic picture today to cause a rush into gold. The technical  damage caused by the decline is enormous and it cannot be erased  quickly. Avoid gold and gold stocks.&#8217;” <i>New York Times</i>, August 19.</p>
<p><b>You can see that these comments were made literally within days of the bottom! Take note, technical analysts.</b></p>

<p>Wow, were they kidding?! This reminds me of those <strike>dimwits</strike> journalists who said in 2011 to not invest in gold because it isn’t “<a href="http://www.caseyresearch.com/go/bwCwP/ATP" target="_blank">backed by anything</a>.”</p>

<p>No comment necessary.</p>
<p><b>[12]</b>  “He believes the price of bullion is headed below $100 an ounce. ‘Who  wants to put money over there now?&#8217;” As stated by Lawrence Helm in the <i>New York Times</i>, September 12.</p>
<p>The price of gold had bottomed two weeks before, making the timing of this advice about the worst it could possibly be.</p>
<p><b>[13]</b>  Author Elliot Janeway, whose book jacket states, “Presidents listen to  him,” was asked by a book reviewer about his preferred investments. He  writes: “Then, gold and silver?

<p>Mr.  Janeway ate his words big-time: from the date of his comments to  silver’s peak of $50 on January 21, 1980, silver rose 1,055%!</p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p><b>[14]</b> “Mr. Holt admits that ‘in 1974, intense speculation caused the gold price to get too far ahead of itself.&#8217;” <i>New York Times</i>, December 19.</p>
<p>So,  anything sound familiar here? Yes, it was a brutal time for gold  investors, but what’s obvious is that those who looked only at the price  and ignored the fundamentals ended up eating their words and dispensing  horrible advice. Investors who followed the “wisdom of the day” missed  out on one of the greatest opportunities for profit in their lifetimes.</p>
<p>I  was pleased to learn, though, that not all comments were negative in  1976. In fact, in the middle of the “great selloff,” there were those  who remained stanchly bullish. These investors must’ve been viewed as  outliers – they, much like some of us now, were the contrarians of the  day.</p>
<p>Also from 1976…</p>
<ul>
<li>“Many gold issues, in fact, are  down 40 percent or more from their highs. Investors who overstayed the  market are apparently making their disenchantment known. The current  issue of the Lowe Investment and Financial Letter says, ‘We are showing  losses on our gold mining share recommended list… but keep in mind that  these shares are for the long-term as investments.&#8217;” <i>New York Times</i>, March 26.
<p>Sounds like what you might read in an issue of a Casey Research metals newsletter..</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>“The time to buy gold shares,” [James Dines] declares, “is when there is blood in the streets.” <i>New York Times</i>, September 12.
<p>If you glance at the chart above, Jim’s comments were made within two weeks of the absolute low.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>“We’re  recommending to clients that they hold gold and gold shares,” [C.  Austin Barker, consulting economist] says. “The low-production-cost  mines in South Africa might be interesting to buy for the longer term  because I see further inflation ahead.” <i>New York Times</i>, September 12.
<p>Investors who listened to Mr. Barker ended up seeing massive gains in their gold and gold equity holdings.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>

<li>“The  probability of runaway inflation by 1980 is 50%… In light of this,  the only safe investments are gold, silver, and Swiss francs,&#8217;” said the  late Harry Browne on November 21 in the <i>New York Times</i>.<br />
 </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>“In the longer run, [Jeffrey Nichols of Argus  Research] believes gold’s price trend ‘is much more likely to be upward  than downward.&#8217;” <i>New York Times</i>, December 19.
<p>The “longer run” won.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>“‘I think the intermediate  outlook for gold is a period of consolidation and a bit of dullness,’  says Mr. Werden. ‘However, six or nine months from now, we could see  renewed interest in gold.&#8217;” <i>New York Times</i>, December 19.
<p>He was right; within nine months gold had risen 13.5%.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>“Mr.  Holt offers some advice to investors who are taking tax losses on their  South African gold shares – some of which are selling at just 30 to 35  percent of their peak prices in 1974. ‘If leverage has worked against  you on the way down,’ he reasons, ‘why not take advantage of it on the  way up?&#8217;” <i>New York Times, </i>December 19.
<p>Solid advice for investors today, too.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>“What’s his  [Thomas J. Holt] prediction for the future price of gold? ‘A new high,  reaching above $200 an ounce, within the next couple years.&#8217;” <i>New York Times</i>, December 19.
<p>His prediction was conservative; gold reached $200 nineteen months later, by July 1978.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s  clear that there were positive “voices in the wilderness” during that  big correction, and as we all know, those who listened profited  mightily.</p>
<div class="code-block code-block-1" style="margin: 0px">
<div align="center" class="mrf-external">
<a href="https://amorain.com/?E=ikLQsSIi%2fgaXBh0SRK5s8g%3d%3d&amp;s1="><img src="https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/500.jpg"></a></p>

</div>
<p>There were other interesting tidbits, too. For example,  gold stocks had been performing so poorly for so long that some advisors  suggested a strategy we also hear today…</p>
<ul>
<li>“It is probably too  late to sell gold shares, the stock market’s worst-acting group these  days, except for one possible strategy: selling to take a tax loss and  switching into a comparable gold security to retain a position in the  group.” <i>New York Times</i>, September 12.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even back then, it was widely known that gold often bucks the trend of the broader markets…</p>
<ul>
<li>“You  might put a small portion of your money into gold shares and pray like  the dickens that you lose half of it. In that way, chances are that if  gold shares go down, the rest of your stock portfolio will go up.” <i>New York Times</i>, September 12.</li>
</ul>
<p>Gold miners provided critical revenue and jobs, just like today. From the August 2 issue of <i>Time</i> magazine…</p>
<ul>
<li>“South  Africa, the world’s largest gold producer, is being hurt the most. The  price drop will cost it at least $200 million in potential export  earnings this year.”</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>“Layoffs at the gold mines would make it even worse – the joblessness could intensify South Africa’s explosive racial unrest.”</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The  Soviet Union, the world’s second-largest gold producer, is feeling the  price drop, too. The Soviets depend on gold sales to get hard currency  needed to buy US grain and other imports.”</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/stopcollections.html" rel="nofollow" style="float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_qLAIskTQXUc/TZ933kKraOI/AAAAAAAAIHg/pK9hCPBnyhw/120x2401.gif"></a>Gold was also used as collateral…</p>
<ul>
<li>“The  international gold market was also roiled yesterday by a report by the  Commodity News Service that Iran was negotiating to lend South Africa  roughly $600 million, predicated on a collateral of 6.25 million ounces  of gold.”</li>
</ul>
<p>And just like today, there were plenty of <strike>stupid</strike> misguided US politicians: From the <i>New York Times</i> on August 27:</p>
<ul>
<li>“The  drop in gold bullion prices from $126, which was the average at the  first IMF auction June 2, provoked the Swiss National Bank to attack  Washington’s attitude toward the metal as ‘childish.’ Aside from the  estimated $4.8 billion of gold reserves held by Switzerland, bankers  there advocate some role for the metal as a form of discipline against  unrestricted printing of paper money.”</li>
</ul>
<p>That last statement from the Swiss bankers is hauntingly just as true today.</p>
<p>Last,  you know how the government in India has been tinkering with the  precious-metals market in its country? And how it’s led to smuggling?  From the <i>New York Times</i> on August 27:</p>
<ul>
<li>“India  announced it was resuming its ban on the export of silver. India is  believed to have the largest silver hoard and the government there freed  exports earlier this year as a means of earning taxes levied on  overseas sales. However, most silver dealers minimized the significance  of India’s move yesterday. As one dealer explained, ‘Smuggling silver  out of India is so ingrained there that the ban will have no effect on  the flow. It never has. Indian silver will continue to ebb and flow into  the world market according to price.&#8217;”</li>
</ul>
<p>So what’s the  difference in mood today vs. the mid-1970s? Nothing! This shows that the  same concerns, fears, and confusion we have now existed at a similar  point in the gold market then. There were also those who saw the big  picture and stayed vigilant. Virtually every comment made in 1976 could  apply to today. Keep in mind that most of the statements above are from  two publications only; there are undoubtedly many more similar comments  from that year.</p>
<p>The obvious lesson here is that patience won out  in the end. It took the gold price three years and seven months to  return to its December 1974 high. It only took another 18 months to soar  to $850. Today, that would be the equivalent of gold falling until June  this year, and not returning to its $1,921 high until April, 2015. It  would also mean we climb to $6,227 and get there in November, 2016.</p>
<p>Could you wait that long for a fourfold return?</p>
<p>This review of  history gives us the confidence to know that our gold investments are on  the right track. I hope you’ll join me and everyone else at Casey  Research in accepting this message from history and staying the course.</p>
<p>So, what will your kids or grandkids read in a few decades?</p>
<ul>
<li>“Buy gold. It’s going a lot higher.” Jeff Clark, Casey Research, March 24, 2013.</li>
</ul>
<p>Gold  is going higher, but gold producers are going to go higher still. Now,  junior gold explorers… if you select the right ones, you’ll experience  life-changing gains. Identifying junior gold miners with the right stuff  is how contrarian investing legends Doug Casey, Rick Rule, and Bill  Bonner have made millions – and right now you have the opportunity to  hear them reveal exactly how they did it, and how you can, too. It’s all  happening during the upcoming <i>Downturn Millionaires</i> web video event, which is free.

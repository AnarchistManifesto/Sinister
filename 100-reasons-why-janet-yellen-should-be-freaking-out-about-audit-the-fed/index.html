<a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2015/02/100-reasons-why-janet-yellen-should-be.html"><b>Activist Post</b></a></p>
<p>Janet Yellen is very alarmed that some members of Congress want to  conduct a comprehensive audit of the Federal Reserve for the first time  since it was created.  If the Fed is doing everything correctly, why  should Yellen be alarmed?  What does she have to hide?</p>
<p>During testimony  before Congress on Tuesday, she made “central bank independence” sound  like it was the holy grail.  Even though every other government function  is debated politically in this country, Yellen insists that what the  Federal Reserve does is “too important” to be influenced by the American  people.  Does any other government agency ever dare to make that  claim?</p>
<p>But of course the Federal Reserve is not a government agency.   It is a private banking cartel that has far more power over our money  and our economy than anyone else does.  And later on in this article I  am going to share with you dozens of reasons why Congress should <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Revolution-Manifesto-Ron-Paul/dp/0446537527?tag=permacultucom-20&amp;linkCode=w13&amp;linkID=FGBNVPA47LBE2NTM&amp;ref_=assoc_res_sw_result_2">shut it  down</a>.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>The immense power wielded by the Federal Reserve is clearly  demonstrated whenever Janet Yellen speaks publicly.  On Tuesday, her  comments about interest rates sent stocks <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/markets/2015/02/24/stocks-tuesday/23928385/" target="_blank" title="to brand new record highs">to brand new record highs</a>…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yellen, in her semi-annual testimony before the Senate  banking committee, used a word familiar to investors when she reiterated  that the central bank will be “patient” on raising interest rates for  the first time since the 2008 financial crisis. Traders took that as a  sign that interest rates would remain unchanged until autumn. </p>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 92.35 points (0.5%) to  18,209.19, while the Standard &amp; Poors 500 gained 5.82 points (0.3%)  to 2,115.48, both eclipsing Friday’s record closes.</p>
<div align="left">
<ins class="adsbygoogle" style="height: 60px;margin-bottom: 0.5em;width: 468px"></ins></p>
<p>    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || ).push({});
</p></div>
</blockquote>
<p>But Yellen was also unusually defensive on Tuesday.  The “Audit the  Fed” bill that is being sponsored by Rand Paul (among others) has her  really freaked out.  The following comes from <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/finance/233616-yellen-i-strongly-oppose-bill-to-audit-the-fed" target="_blank" title="the Hill">the Hill</a>…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Appearing before the Senate Banking Committee, Yellen was  on the defensive, as Republicans questioned how the Fed conducts  monetary policy and Democrats put forward ideas for getting tougher on  Wall Street. </p>
<p>In the midst of all of it, Yellen generally argued the Fed was  designed as an independent entity for a reason — and it would be best  not to change it. </p>
<p>“Central bank independence in conducting monetary policy is  considered a best practice for central banks around the world,” she  said. “Academic studies, I think, establish beyond the shadow of a doubt  that independent central banks perform better.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In fact, she went so far as to mention the “Audit the Fed” bill <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/finance/233616-yellen-i-strongly-oppose-bill-to-audit-the-fed" target="_blank" title="by name">by name</a>…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A GOP-controlled Congress has given the bill its best  chances yet of passage, and that renewed interest led Yellen to deliver  her most spirited opposition yet. </p>
<p>“I want to be completely clear,” she said. “I strongly oppose Audit the Fed.”</p>
<p>Yellen argued the audit measure would allow politicians to  second-guess the Fed’s decisions, which, in turn, would weaken the  central bank. And the ultimate victim of that process, she said, would  be the U.S. economy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/backyardliberty.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 0em;margin-left: 1em"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-k0NQ-rOJPq0/UPDSF5crnFI/AAAAAAAATcw/i7Q6pBk-hoQ/s200/BL_013-200.gif" alt=""></a>So what is she so concerned about?</p>
<p>We are all accountable to someone.</p>
<p>What is so wrong about the Federal Reserve being accountable to Congress?</p>
<p>Why can’t we find out what is really going on inside the Fed?</p>
<p>And of course it isn’t just Yellen that is freaking out.  Just consider these comments <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-federal-reserve-audit-the-fed-richard-fisher-rand-paul-20150211-story.html" target="_blank" title="from Richard Fisher">from Richard Fisher</a>, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It is always politically convenient to make something  sound mysterious, if not malevolent, by claiming it is opaque,” Fisher  said in a speech to the Economic Club of New York that is part of an  effort by Fed officials to fight the legislation. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“My suspicion is that many of those in Congress calling for  ‘auditing’ the Fed are really sheep in wolves’ clothing,” he said.  “Having proven themselves unable to cobble together with colleagues a  working fiscal policy or to construct a regulatory regime that  incentivizes rather than discourages investment and job creation — in  other words, failed at their own job — they simply find it convenient to  create a bogeyman out of an entity that does its job efficiently.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Obviously this is a very, very touchy subject over at the Fed.</p>
<p>It is quite clear that they do not want the rest of us to be able to see what they are really up to.</p>
<p>And the truth is that if the American people really did know how the  Federal Reserve works and what it has been doing behind closed doors,  most Americans would want it shut down tomorrow.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, the reality of the matter is that we don’t even need a Federal Reserve.  I really like how <a href="http://davidstockmanscontracorner.com/audit-the-fed-and-shackle-it-too/" target="_blank" title="David Stockman">David Stockman</a> made this point the other day…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the end of the day, American capitalism does not need  recycled political hacks like Jerome H. Powell or clueless school marms  like Janet Yellen to thrive. If we need a Fed at all, it is the one  designed by Carter Glass 100 years ago. <i><b>That is, a “bankers  bank” that was intended to provide standby liquidity at a penalty  spread above the free market interest rate in consideration for good  collateral originating from inventory and receivables in the real  economy.</b></i> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Under that arrangement, there would be no monetary central planning  or pointless attempts to manage the level of GDP, the number of new  jobs, the rate of housing starts, the fluctuations of the CPI or  the amplitudes of the business cycle. There would also be no pegging of  the money market rate, no helping hand for Wall Street gamblers, no  cheap debt to enable profligate politicians to kick-the-can down the  road indefinitely. </p>

<p><i><b>In short, what the nation really needs is not an  “independent” Fed, but one that is shackled to a narrow and  market-driven liquidity function.</b></i> The rest of its  current remit is nothing more than the self-serving aggrandizement of  the apparatchiks who run it; and who have now managed to turn the  nation’s vital money and capital markets into dangerous, unstable  casinos, and the nations savers into indentured servants of a bloated  and wasteful banking system.</p>

<p>The Federal Reserve has been around for just over a hundred years,  and it has done an absolutely abysmal job for the American people.</p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>I want to share with you some facts and figures that I have <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/on-the-100th-anniversary-of-the-federal-reserve-here-are-100-reasons-to-shut-it-down-forever" target="_blank" title="shared before">shared before</a>,  but they bear repeating.  Please share this list of 100 reasons why the  Federal Reserve should be shut down with everyone that you know…</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/backyardliberty.html" rel="nofollow" style="float: right;margin-left: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ONE8Lk_RzR8/UjeZnRyZRTI/AAAAAAAAVJw/TMNS4NzHKZo/s220/BL_158220.gif" alt=""></a><b>#1</b> We like to think that we have a government “of  the people, by the people, for the people”, but the truth is that an  unelected, unaccountable group of central planners has far more power  over our economy than anyone else in our society does.</p>
<p><b>#2</b> The Federal Reserve is actually “independent” of  the government.  In fact, the Federal Reserve has argued vehemently in  federal court that it is <a href="http://www.wlf.org/Upload/legalstudies/legalopinionletter/102309Fleschert_LOL.pdf" target="_blank" title='"not an agency"'>“not an agency”</a> of the federal government and therefore not subject to the Freedom of Information Act.</p>
<p><b>#3</b> The Federal Reserve openly admits that the 12 regional Federal Reserve banks are organized “<a href="http://www.federalreserveeducation.org/faq/topics/fed_basics.cfm" target="_blank" title="much like private corporations">much like private corporations</a>“.</p>
<p><b>#4</b> The regional Federal Reserve banks <a href="http://www.federalreserveeducation.org/faq/topics/fed_basics.cfm" target="_blank" title="issue shares of stock">issue shares of stock</a> to the “member banks” that own them.</p>
<p><b>#5</b> 100% of the shareholders of the Federal Reserve are <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/who-owns-the-federal-reserve" target="_blank" title="private banks">private banks</a>.  The U.S. government owns zero shares.</p>
<p><b>#6</b> The Federal Reserve is not an agency of the  federal government, but it has been given power to regulate our banks  and financial institutions.  This should not be happening.</p>
<p><b>#7</b> According to <a href="http://www.usconstitution.net/const.html#A1Sec1" target="_blank" title="Article I, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution">Article I, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution</a>,  the U.S. Congress is the one that is supposed to have the authority to  “coin Money, regulate the Value thereof, and of foreign Coin, and fix  the Standard of Weights and Measures”.  So why is the Federal Reserve  doing it?</p>
<p><b>#8</b> If you look at a “U.S. dollar”, it actually says  “Federal Reserve note” at the top.  In the financial world, a “note” is  an instrument of debt.</p>
<p><b>#9</b> In 1963, President John F. Kennedy issued <a href="http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=59049" target="_blank" title="Executive Order 11110">Executive Order 11110</a>  which authorized the U.S. Treasury to issue “United States notes” which  were created by the U.S. government directly and not by the Federal  Reserve.  He was assassinated shortly thereafter.</p>
<p><b>#10</b> Many of the debt-free United States notes issued under President Kennedy <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/debt-free-united-states-notes-were-once-issued-under-jfk-and-the-u-s-government-still-has-the-power-to-issue-debt-free-money" target="_blank" title="are still in circulation today">are still in circulation today</a>.</p>
<p><b>#11</b> The Federal Reserve determines what levels some  of the most important interest rates in our system are going to be set  at.  In a free market system, the free market would determine those  interest rates.</p>
<p><b>#12</b> The Federal Reserve has become so powerful that it is now known as “<a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/10-things-that-every-american-should-know-about-the-federal-reserve" target="_blank" title="the fourth branch of government">the fourth branch of government</a>.”</p>
<p><b>#13</b> The greatest period of economic growth in U.S. history was when <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/during-the-best-period-of-economic-growth-in-u-s-history-there-was-no-income-tax-and-no-federal-reserve" target="_blank" title="there was no central bank">there was no central bank</a>.</p>
<p><b>#14</b> The Federal Reserve was designed to be <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/where-does-money-come-from-the-giant-federal-reserve-scam-that-most-americans-do-not-understand" target="_blank" title="a perpetual debt machine">a perpetual debt machine</a>.   The bankers that designed it intended to trap the U.S. government in a  perpetual debt spiral from which it could never possibly escape.  Since  the Federal Reserve was established 100 years ago, the U.S. national  debt has gotten <b>more than 5000 times larger</b>.</p>
<p><b>#15</b> A permanent federal income tax was established <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue_Act_of_1913" target="_blank" title="the exact same year">the exact same year</a>  that the Federal Reserve was created.  This was not a coincidence.  In  order to pay for all of the government debt that the Federal Reserve  would create, a federal income tax was necessary.  The whole idea was to  transfer wealth from our pockets to the federal government and from the  federal government to the bankers.</p>

<p><b>#20</b> During the 100 years before the Federal Reserve was created, the U.S. economy <a href="http://www.theburningplatform.com/2013/12/17/keeping-it-real/" target="_blank" title="rarely had any problems with inflation">rarely had any problems with inflation</a>.  But since the Federal Reserve was established, the U.S. economy has experienced constant and never ending inflation.</p>
<p><b>#21</b> In the century before the Federal Reserve was  created, the average annual rate of inflation was about half a percent.   In the century since the Federal Reserve was created, the average  annual rate of inflation has been <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-09-12/two-centuries-inflation" target="_blank" title="about 3.5 percent">about 3.5 percent</a>.</p>
<p><b>#22</b> The Federal Reserve has stripped the middle class of trillions of dollars of wealth through the hidden tax of inflation.</p>

<p><b>#36</b> Since late 2008, the size of the Federal Reserve balance sheet has grown from less than a trillion dollars <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-12-19/feds-balance-sheet-rises-record-401-trillion" target="_blank" title="to more than 4 trillion dollars">to more than 4 trillion dollars</a>.  This is complete and utter insanity.</p>
<p><b>#37</b> During the quantitative easing era, the value of  the financial securities that the Fed has accumulated is greater than  the total amount of publicly held debt that the U.S. government  accumulated <a href="http://cnsnews.com/news/article/terence-p-jeffrey/339t-quantitative-explosion-fed-owns-more-treasuries-and-mbs-publicly" target="_blank" title="from the presidency of George Washington though the end of the presidency of Bill Clinton">from the presidency of George Washington through the end of the presidency of Bill Clinton</a>.</p>

<p><b>#41</b> According to a prominent Federal Reserve insider, quantitative easing has been one giant “<a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/federal-reserve-whistleblower-tells-america-the-real-reason-for-quantitative-easing" target="_blank" title="subsidy">subsidy</a>” for Wall Street banks.</p>
<p><b>#42</b> As one CNBC article stated, we are seeing absolutely rampant inflation in “<a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/101283037" target="_blank" title="stocks and bonds and art and Ferraris and farmland">stocks and bonds and art and Ferraris</a>“.</p>
<p><b>#43</b> Donald Trump once made the following statement about quantitative easing: “<a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/federal-reserve-whistleblower-tells-america-the-real-reason-for-quantitative-easing" target="_blank" title="People like me will benefit from this.">People like me will benefit from this.</a>”</p>
<p><b>#44</b> Most people have never heard about this, but <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/49031991" target="_blank" title="CNBC article">a very interesting study</a> conducted for the Bank of England shows that quantitative easing actually increases the gap between the wealthy and the poor.</p>
<p><b>#45</b> The gap between the top one percent and the rest of the country is now the greatest that it has been <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/101025377" target="_blank" title="since the 1920s">since the 1920s</a>.</p>
<p><b>#46</b> The mainstream media has sold quantitative  easing to the American public as an “economic stimulus program”, but the  truth is that the percentage of Americans that have a job <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Employment-Population-Ratio-20131.png" target="_blank" title="has actually gone down">has actually gone down</a> since quantitative easing first began.</p>
<p><b>#47</b> The Federal Reserve is supposed to be able to  guide the nation toward “full employment”, but the reality of the matter  is that an all-time record <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/10-facts-about-the-growing-unemployment-crisis-in-america-that-will-blow-your-mind" target="_blank" title="more than 102 million working age Americans">102 million working age Americans</a> do not have a job right now.  That number has risen by about 27 million since the year 2000.</p>
<p><b>#48</b> For years, the projections of economic growth by the Federal Reserve have <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-12-19/feds-economic-projections-myth-vs-reality-dec-2013" target="_blank" title="consistently overstated">consistently overstated</a>  the strength of the U.S. economy.  But every single time, the  mainstream media continues to report that these numbers are “reliable”  even though all they actually represent is wishful thinking.</p>
<p><b>#49</b> The Federal Reserve system fuels the growth of  government, and the growth of government fuels the growth of the Federal  Reserve system.  Since 1970, federal spending has grown <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-08-08/40-years-unbearable-heaviness-being-american-taxpayer" target="_blank" title="nearly 12 times as rapidly">nearly 12 times as rapidly</a> as median household income has.</p>

<p><b>#54</b> We were told that the purpose of quantitative  easing is to help “stimulate the economy”, but today the Federal Reserve  is actually paying the big banks <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/the-federal-reserve-is-paying-banks-not-to-lend-1-8-trillion-dollars-to-the-american-people" target="_blank" title="not to lend out 1.8 trillion dollars">not to lend out 1.8 trillion dollars</a> in “excess reserves” that they have parked at the Fed.</p>
<p><b>#55</b> The Federal Reserve has allowed an absolutely  gigantic derivatives bubble to inflate which could destroy our financial  system at any moment.  Right now, four of the “too big to fail” banks  each have total exposure to derivatives that is well in excess of <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/too-big-to-fail-banks-are-taking-over-as-number-of-u-s-banks-falls-to-all-time-record-low" target="_blank" title="40 trillion dollars">40 trillion dollars</a>.</p>

<p><b>#57</b> Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has a <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/say-what-30-ben-bernanke-quotes-that-are-so-stupid-that-you-wont-know-whether-to-laugh-or-cry" target="_blank" title="track record of failure">track record of failure</a> that would make the Chicago Cubs look good.</p>
<p><b>#58</b> The secret November 1910 gathering at Jekyll  Island, Georgia during which the plan for the Federal Reserve was  hatched was attended by U.S. Senator Nelson W.

<p><b>#63</b> The following comes directly from <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/mission.htm" target="_blank" title="the Fed's official mission statement">the Fed’s official mission statement</a>:  “To provide the nation with a safer, more flexible, and more stable  monetary and financial system.”  Without a doubt, the Federal Reserve  has failed in those tasks dramatically.</p>
<p><b>#64</b> The Fed decides what the target rate of  inflation should be, what the target rate of unemployment should be and  what the size of the money supply is going to be.  This is quite similar  to the “<a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/how-is-the-central-economic-planning-that-the-federal-reserve-does-different-from-the-central-economic-planning-that-communist-china-does" target="_blank" title="central planning">central planning</a>” that goes on in communist nations, but very few people in our government seem upset by this.</p>
<p><b>#65</b> A couple of years ago, Federal Reserve officials walked into one bank in Oklahoma and demanded that they take down <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/the-federal-reserve-bans-a-local-oklahoma-bank-from-displaying-crosses-bible-verses-and-christmas-buttons" target="_blank" title="all the Bible verses and all the Christmas buttons">all the Bible verses and all the Christmas buttons</a> that the bank had been displaying.</p>
<p><b>#66</b> The Federal Reserve has taken some other very  frightening steps in recent years.  For example, back in 2011 the  Federal Reserve <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/66281284/Frbny-Social-Media-Rfp" target="_blank" title="has announced plans">announced plans</a>  to identify “key bloggers” and to monitor “billions of conversations”  about the Fed on Facebook, Twitter, forums and blogs.  Someone at the  Fed will almost certainly end up reading this article.</p>
<p><b>#67</b> Thanks to this endless debt spiral that we are  trapped in, a massive amount of money is transferred out of our pockets  and into the pockets of the ultra-wealthy each year.  Incredibly, the  U.S. government spent <a href="http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/ir/ir_expense.htm" target="_blank" title="more than 415 billion dollars">more than 415 billion dollars</a> just on interest on the national debt in 2013.</p>
<p><b>#68</b> In January 2000, the average rate of interest on the government’s marketable debt was <a href="http://cnsnews.com/news/article/terence-p-jeffrey/roll-over-plan-treasury-needed-pay-record-75t-maturing-debt-fy-2013" target="_blank" title="6.620 percent">6.620 percent</a>.   If we got back to that level today, we would be paying more than a  trillion dollars a year just in interest on the national debt and it  would collapse our entire financial system.</p>
<p><b>#69</b> The American people are being killed by compound  interest but most of them don’t even understand what it is.  Albert  Einstein once made <a href="http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/my-money/2010/09/23/compound-interest-best-friend-or-worst-enemy" target="_blank" title="the following statement">the following statement</a> about compound interest…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. He who understands it, earns it … he who doesn’t … pays it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>#70</b> Most Americans have absolutely no idea where  money comes from.  The truth is that the Federal Reserve just creates it  out of thin air.  The following is how I have <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/where-does-money-come-from-the-giant-federal-reserve-scam-that-most-americans-do-not-understand" target="_blank" title="previously described">previously described</a> how money is normally created by the Fed in our system…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the U.S. government decides that it wants to spend  another billion dollars that it does not have, it does not print up a  billion dollars. </p>
<p>Rather, the U.S. government creates a bunch of U.S. Treasury bonds (debt) and takes them over to the Federal Reserve.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve creates a billion dollars out of thin air and exchanges them for the U.S. Treasury bonds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>#71</b> What does the Federal Reserve do with those U.S. Treasury bonds?  They end up getting auctioned off <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/11-reasons-why-the-federal-reserve-should-be-abolished" target="_blank" title="to the highest bidder">to the highest bidder</a>.  But this entire process actually creates more debt than it does money…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The U.S. Treasury bonds that the Federal Reserve receives  in exchange for the money it has created out of nothing are auctioned  off through the Federal Reserve system.<br />
But wait.</p>
<p>There is a problem. </p>
<p>Because the U.S. government must pay interest on the Treasury bonds,  the amount of debt that has been created by this transaction is greater  than the amount of money that has been created. </p>
<p>So where will the U.S. government get the money to pay that debt? </p>
<p>Well, the theory is that we can get money to circulate through the  economy really, really fast and tax it at a high enough rate that the  government will be able to collect enough taxes to pay the debt. </p>

<p>But that never actually happens, does it? </p>
<p>And the creators of the Federal Reserve understood this as well.   They understood that the U.S. government would not have enough money to  both run the government and service the national debt.  They knew that  the U.S. government would have to keep borrowing even more money in an  attempt to keep up with the game.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/goingglobal.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: left;float: right;margin-bottom: 0em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/_qLAIskTQXUc/TZ9T4BhStII/AAAAAAAAIHA/WjeJNPu91cA/Banner1_180x150.jpg"></a><b>#72</b> Of course the U.S. government could actually  create money and spend it directly into the economy without the Federal  Reserve being involved at all.  But then we wouldn’t be 17 trillion  dollars in debt and that wouldn’t serve the interests of the bankers at  all.</p>
<p><b>#73</b> The following is what <a href="http://publicbankinginstitute.org/thomas-edison-article" target="_blank" title="Thomas Edison">Thomas Edison</a> once had to say about our absolutely insane debt-based financial system…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That is to say, under the old way any time we wish to add to the national wealth we are compelled to add to the national debt. </p>
<p>Now, that is what Henry Ford wants to prevent. He thinks it is  stupid, and so do I, that for the loan of $30,000,000 of their own money  the people of the United States should be compelled to pay $66,000,000 —  that is what it amounts to, with interest. People who will not turn a  shovelful of dirt nor contribute a pound of material will collect more  money from the United States than will the people who supply the  material and do the work. That is the terrible thing about interest. In  all our great bond issues the interest is always greater than the  principal. All of the great public works cost more than twice the actual  cost, on that account. Under the present system of doing business we  simply add 120 to 150 per cent, to the stated cost. </p>
<p>But here is the point: If our nation can issue a dollar bond, it can  issue a dollar bill. The element that makes the bond good makes the bill  good.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>#74</b> The United States now has <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/tag/national-debt" target="_blank" title="the largest national debt">the largest national debt</a>  in the history of the world, and we are stealing roughly 100 million  dollars from our children and our grandchildren every single hour of  every single day in a desperate attempt to keep the debt spiral going.</p>
<p><b>#75</b> Thomas Jefferson once stated that if he could add just one more amendment to the U.S. Constitution <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson" target="_blank" title="it would be a ban on all government borrowing">it would be a ban on all government borrowing</a>…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wish it were possible to obtain a single amendment to  our Constitution. I would be willing to depend on that alone for the  reduction of the administration of our government to the genuine  principles of its Constitution; I mean an additional article, taking  from the federal government the power of borrowing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>#76</b> At this moment, the U.S. national debt is sitting at <a href="http://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/debt/current" target="_blank" title="$17,251,528,475,994.19">$18,141,409,083,212.36</a>.  If we had followed the advice of Thomas Jefferson, it would be sitting at zero.</p>

<p><b>#78</b> We are on pace to accumulate more new debt under  the 8 years of the Obama administration than we did under all of the  other presidents in all of U.S. history combined.</p>
<p><b>#79</b> If all of the new debt that has been accumulated  since John Boehner became Speaker of the House had been given directly  to the American people instead, every household in America would have  been able <a href="http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/terence-p-jeffrey/under-boehner-debt-3t-under-3-yrs-enough-buy-every-household-3-yrs" target="_blank" title="to buy a new truck">to buy a new truck</a>.</p>

<p><b>#86</b> Sometimes we forget just how much money a  trillion dollars is.  If you were alive when Jesus Christ was born and  you spent one million dollars every single day since that point, you  still would not have spent one trillion dollars by now.</p>

<p><b>#88</b> In addition to all of our debt, the U.S. government has also accumulated <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-08/blink-u-s-debt-just-grew-by-11-trillion.html" target="_blank" title="more than 200 trillion dollars">more than 200 trillion dollars</a> in unfunded liabilities.  So where in the world will all of that money come from?</p>

<p><b>#90</b> Over the past several years, the Federal Reserve has been monetizing <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/the-federal-reserve-is-monetizing-a-staggering-amount-of-u-s-government-debt" target="_blank" title="a staggering amount of U.S. government debt">a staggering amount of U.S. government debt</a> even though Ben Bernanke once promised that he would never do this.</p>

<p><b>#92</b> Most Americans have no idea that one of our most  famous presidents was absolutely obsessed with getting rid of central  banking in the United States.  The following is <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Andrew_Jackson" target="_blank" title="a February 1834 quote">a February 1834 quote</a> by President Andrew Jackson about the evils of central banking…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I too have been a close observer of the doings of the  Bank of the United States. I have had men watching you for a long time,  and am convinced that you have used the funds of the bank to speculate  in the breadstuffs of the country. When you won, you divided the profits  amongst you, and when you lost, you charged it to the Bank. You tell me  that if I take the deposits from the Bank and annul its charter I shall  ruin ten thousand families. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That may be true, gentlemen, but that is  your sin! Should I let you go on, you will ruin fifty thousand families,  and that would be my sin! <b>You are a den of vipers and thieves. I have determined to rout you out and, by the Eternal,</b> (bringing his fist down on the table) <b>I will rout you out.</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>#93</b> There are plenty of possible alternative financial systems, but at this point <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-02-15/the-secret-meeting-that-launched-the-federal-reserve-echoes.html" target="_blank" title="all 187 nations">all 187 nations</a> that belong to the IMF have a central bank.  Are we supposed to believe that this is just some sort of a bizarre coincidence?</p>
<p><b>#94</b> The capstone of the global central banking  system is an organization known as the Bank for International  Settlements.  The following is how I described this organization in a <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/who-controls-the-money-an-unelected-unaccountable-central-bank-of-the-world-secretly-does" target="_blank" title="previous article">previous article</a>…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An immensely powerful international organization that  most people have never even heard of secretly controls the money supply  of the entire globe.  It is called the Bank for International  Settlements, and it is the central bank of central banks.  It is located  in Basel, Switzerland, but it also has branches in Hong Kong and Mexico  City.  It is essentially an unelected, unaccountable central bank of  the world that has complete immunity from taxation and from national  laws.  Even Wikipedia admits that “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_for_International_Settlements" target="_blank" title="it is not accountable to any single national government.">it is not accountable to any single national government.</a>”   The Bank for International Settlements was used to launder money for  the Nazis during World War II, but these days the main purpose of the  BIS is to guide and direct the centrally-planned global financial  system.</p>
<p>Today, 58 global central banks belong to the BIS, and it has  far more power over how the U.S. economy (or any other economy for that  matter) will perform over the course of the next year than any  politician does.  Every two months, the central bankers of the world  gather in Basel for another “Global Economy Meeting”.  During those  meetings, decisions are made which affect every man, woman and child on  the planet, and yet none of us have any say in what goes on.  The Bank  for International Settlements is an organization that was founded by the  global elite and it operates for the benefit of the global elite, and  it is intended to be one of the key cornerstones of the emerging one  world economic system.</p>

<p><b>#95</b> The borrower is the servant of the lender, and the Federal Reserve has turned all of us into debt slaves.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/bitcoinalliance.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 0em;margin-left: 1em"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-3jl7P_lOE00/VCCMcYDm37I/AAAAAAAAAyg/CjKm6lYrXD8/s180/180x150111cedbb-af91-4ad8-9989-611713e25b18.jpg"></a><b>#96</b> Debt is a form of social control, and the global  elite use all of this debt to dominate all the rest of us.  40 years  ago, the total amount of debt in our system (all government debt, all  business debt, all consumer debt, etc.) was sitting at about 2 trillion  dollars.  Today, the grand total exceeds 56 trillion dollars.</p>
<p><b>#97</b> Unless something dramatic is done, our children  and our grandchildren will be debt slaves for their entire lives as they  service our debts and pay for our mistakes.</p>
<p><b>#98</b> Now that you know this information, you are responsible for doing something about it.</p>
<p><b>#99</b> Congress has the power to shut down the Federal  Reserve any time that it would like.  But right now most of our  politicians fully endorse the current system, and nothing is ever going  to happen until the American people start demanding change.</p>
<p><b>#100</b> The design of the Federal Reserve system was  flawed from the very beginning.  If something is not done very rapidly,  it is inevitable that our entire financial system is going to suffer an  absolutely nightmarish collapse.</p>

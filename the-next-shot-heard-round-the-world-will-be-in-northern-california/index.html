<p>As I have highlighted before, there are three distinct stages of revolution. The 15 counties comprising Northern California have entered stage two on the path to revolution, namely, the civil disobedience stage. And two of the counties have entered the civil disobedience phase with a vengeance as their County Board of Supervisors have voted to secede from the state of California. As I read their local community’s media accounts, accompanied by their reasons for secession, I feel like I’m reading an old United States history textbook in which we could substitute the state of South Carolina for the seceding California counties of Siskiyou and Modoc.  Emotions are running very high as the residents lifestyles and livelihoods are facing total obliteration.</p>
<p><b>Northern California Is an Agenda 21 Battleground</b></p>
<p><a name="more"></a>Over the years, many rural residents have been frustrated by federal <a href="http://thecommonsenseshow.com/2013/09/26/second-county-votes-to-secede-from-california/">environmental laws</a> restricting logging and other forestry activities. The timber industry is dead. The mining industry is dead. The entire region is being deindustrialized and many residents and local leaders have stated that becoming a state would finally allow them to push the federal <a href="http://thecommonsenseshow.com/2013/09/26/second-county-votes-to-secede-from-california/">government</a> to alter the onerous restrictions on government-owned land as well to forsake the private property rights restrictions being imposed upon them.</p>

<p>
I have been aware of Agenda 21 abuses in places like Fort Collins, Colorado, where the courts steal the children from parents who protest against draconian Agenda 21 policies. I’m also aware that in places like Santa Cruz, California and Austin, Texas that individual property rights are severely limited because the local governments have adopted United Nations Agenda 21 policies. However, nothing and I mean nothing, matches the Agenda 21 abuses of individual liberties and private property rights that is going on in the northern counties of California and Southern Oregon. And true to form for the mainstream media, barely a word of coverage has been broadcast or published for a national audience.</p>

<p>Along these lines of selective media coverage, please allow me to ask you a question. Would you find it a tad bit interesting, and would you want to see it on your nightly news if you were to discover that a portion of the country was purposely being made to go broke by the Federal government? Would you further find it newsworthy that the people in Northern California are soon going to be forced off of their lands, by the tens if not hundreds of thousands of people, which will result in their relocation to urban areas to the south? Have you ever seen a Wildlands Agenda 21 map where all the red dots and red colored areas are targeted for becoming ” no human habitation” zones? Well, all of these things and more are taking place in Northern California, and I’m willing to bet that none of you have heard of the horrific abuses that has been perpetrated by the Federal government and their minions in California state government. This is their story.</p>

<p>In September, an aide to Congressman Doug LaMalfa, Erin Ryan, stated that she and fellow staffers favored a proposal for a county in the California Republican’s district to secede from the state, according to local media.</p>
<p>Field representative, Erin Ryan attended a public meeting in September of 2013, in which the Siskiyou County board of supervisors approved a secession declaration, the Redding Record Searchlight <a href="http://www.redding.com/news/2013/sep/03/live-tweets-siskiyou-county-supervisors-discuss-se/">reported</a>. Ryan, went on to say that she and other LaMalfa staff members supported the efforts of counties in Northern California and Southern Oregon to secede from their respective states and form the state of Jefferson. Ryan was careful to state that her views and the views of the other staffers did not necessarily reflect the official view of Congressman LaMalfa. However, in my opinion, the appearance of Ryan and the other staffers at this and similar meetings in Northern California and Southern Oregon, speaks clearly to the interest of Congressman LaMalfa.</p>

<p>The fervor to leave the state of California was also fueled by Modoc County supervisors  who voted 4-0 in favor in secession. Recently, I interviewed Erin Ryan about the events in Northern California and Southern Oregon and what I discovered was that the Federal government and two state governments have declared war upon the residents of this region.</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">

<p><b>No Hunting On Tax Supported Forest Land</b></p>
<p>If you were to drive through the towns along Interstate 5 in Northern California, you would have a hard time finding sporting-goods stores to sell you any hunting equipment. Yet, this region was once the prime hunting grounds in the United States. This is not the case anymore, and Erin Ryan was kind enough to point out the reasons why.</p>
<p>One can still obtain a hunting permit while living in Northern California. However, if you were to be driving your car on a road near a forest, that your taxes go to support, you could not stray from the road by more than one car length. Therefore, in this region of the country, if you wanted to hunt, you literally have to park your car along the side of the road, hike in, shoot your game and then you would have to literally drag your game back out to the road. Hunting is dead and so are sporting-goods stores in this region of the country. </p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/backyardliberty.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-S6RfjP7Lvo8/USlEmRqWjJI/AAAAAAAAUgk/Zio_5z2T_gE/s200/prep.gif"></a>One interesting side note about the US Forest Service, is that they have been closing most roads into forests all across the country. Northern California and Southern Oregon have been greatly impacted by this process. Although a few of the roads remain open, they are not marked and they are nearly impossible to find on a map. Adding insult to injury, there are some people who need to travel on forest roads to get home. If they are caught traveling on the “wrong roads” they can be fined and even jailed.</p>
<p><b>Irrigating Farms</b></p>
<p>Nothing is more fundamental to successful farming then the right to irrigate one’s land. The vast majority of farmers in Northern California and Southern Oregon have previously and successfully adjudicated the right to irrigate their farmland. However, several federal agencies such as the EPA along with several state agencies, are doing everything in their power to prevent farmers from irrigating their land and the previous case law be damned.</p>
<p>According to Erin Ryan, and other locals who I have previously spoken with, the cost passed on to the farmers for pumping water onto their farmland has increased from .6 cents to over $.13 per gallon. For some of these farmers, this represents a $200,000 increase in the cost of irrigating their farmland over the course of a year. This increase is making the cost of farming in this region, unsustainable. This increase is leading to a dramatic drop-off in food production from this region with devastating economic side effects.</p>
<p>Water rights in this region have been carefully adjudicated by the courts. Most of the farmers and ranchers participate in a system which is often referred to as “in-stream flow.” The system allows farmers and ranchers, by prior agreement to siphon off a certain amount of water through a trap door device. A water master routinely inspects these trapdoors to make sure that farmers and ranchers are only taking what they are entitled to take under the law. The system has worked well for several decades has farming and ranching were once very profitable enterprises in this region. But there is a fly in the ointment: state government is requiring these farmers and ranchers to obtain permits before they can open these trapdoor devices, and the farmers and ranchers are being denied permission to obtain the permits. They shouldn’t even have to obtain equipment because their rights to the water have been legally guaranteed, but since when do radical environmentalists ever respect property rights or the letter of the law? The resulting effect spells doom for many of these ranchers and farmers. And God help these farmers and ranchers if a fish, such as a salmon, is ever discovered floating dead through their properties. Hundreds and even thousands of dollars of fines have been levied upon discovery of dead fish. </p>
<p>These farmers and ranchers are literally having their livelihoods and their properties stolen out from underneath of their noses. This is sheer economic tyranny being perpetrated by the Agenda 21 forces of this country.</p>
<p><b>The EPA Destruction of Dams</b></p>
<p>The EPA has announced plans to commence destroying several dams in the Klamath River in order to save the salmon. However, scientific data tells us that salmon would rather be spawning on streams that are within 20 miles of the coast, not 150 miles inland. Taking out the four dams along the Klamath River is an EPA and BLM objective based upon scientific fraud along the same lines as global warming.</p>
<p>If these dams are allowed to be removed, these farmers and ranchers will not be able to obtain the water they need to sustain their livelihoods. It is not an overstatement to claim that the destruction of these dams is an extinction level event for this region. To do so, will result in massive migration of people from this region all in the name of protecting the salmon, which is not even an indigenous fish to this region.</p>
<p><b>Agenda 21 Objectives Being Fulfilled</b></p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/aquaponics4you.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_qLAIskTQXUc/TaemSUAq8EI/AAAAAAAAIOw/3dsETxRGYhY/ad3.jpg"></a>There are clearly a number of forces at work here. First, we see the clear <i>Hunger Games</i> type of agenda in which people have been forced off of pristine land, denied the use of water which results in the destruction of their local food supply. This fact makes people dependent upon the government; and the residents of this region will be forced to relocate to urban areas following the devastating loss of their land. This is becoming  a popular way in which the federal government is forcing people off of their land all across the country while not having to pay the costs associated with legitimate eminent domain. Plain and simple, this process represents a cost-effective method to steal private property on behalf of special interests.</p>
<p>Secondly, we are going to witness the total depopulation of this area in the name of protecting a non-indigenous fish. This is the environmentalist creed of Gaia which turns upside down the traditional and prioritized order of the hierarchy of life on this planet.</p>
<p>The traditional Christian view of hierarchical structure of power on this planet consists of God, man, foul, fish and land. The radical environmentalists hierarchical structure of power consists of land, foul, fish and man with no mention of God. These opposing paradigms are what make most of us scratch our heads and state “What the hell do they think they’re doing?”  The plan begins to make sense when one considers the prime objectives of <a href="http://www.un.org/">Agenda 21</a> as outlined by the United Nations. The United Nations seeks to remove all people and all human habitats from her and wilderness areas and to relocate all people into six mega-regions in what is euphemistically referred to as “stack and pack” cities. The following video outlines the major threats to the people in this region. County Supervisor, Grace Bennett of Siskiyou County, references Agenda 21 as being a motivating force for subjugating not only home region of the country, but the rest of the country as well. The following 9-minute video is important to watch.</p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>Erin Ryan also shared with me that when these four dams are destroyed, the ranches and farms of many of the nearby residents will be flooded out, thus adding to the carnage and destruction being visited upon these people by the federal government.</p>
<p><b>The Algae Factor</b></p>
<p>In a previous radio appearance by Erin Ryan on The Common Sense Show, Ryan related how the destruction of the Klamath River dams will result in huge deposits of algae which will make this pristine land very difficult to farm. It was at this moment that I had an epiphany. The Agenda 21 goal of depopulating this region was also motivated by a secondary goal, the proliferation of algae. This is something that I have a great deal of knowledge about, because I’ve dealt with this issue when I was writing my seven-part series on the Gulf oil explosion.</p>

<p><b>Gulf Dead Zones Caused By Corexit</b></p>
<p>As I discovered in the Gulf, the use of Corexit as the primary oil dispersant was very ineffective and led many researchers, like myself, to question the wisdom of the use of the most toxic dispersant on the face of the earth. In fact, Corexit does not disperse any oil, it merely submerges the oil. But what Corexit does do is it sucks all the CO2 out of the water and creates a dead zone. And this is precisely what we see along vast stretches of the Gulf:  dead zones. When Erin revealed to me that algae proliferation was going to be a byproduct of the destruction of these dams, I realized that this was intentional. In the Gulf, algae farms, the next biofuel craze, have been springing up all along the coastline. The sponsors of this algae movement in the Gulf Coast have been none other than Al Gore, Warren Buffett and George Soros. Following the destruction of these dams, I fully expect to see the same globalists bringing their algae farms to this abandoned region.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/backyardliberty.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ONE8Lk_RzR8/UjeZnRyZRTI/AAAAAAAAVJw/TMNS4NzHKZo/s220/BL_158220.gif" alt=""></a><b>The Mechanics of Secession</b></p>
<p>I have learned from speaking with Erin Ryan that as many as 15 counties in Northern California are moving to secede and join the state of Jefferson; the name of the intended 51st state. Secession faces two major roadblocks for this region. The California state legislature must first approve these counties leaving the state. This, according to Ryan, may not be an insurmountable task, as the counties use more state revenue than they produce. Therefore, it would be cost effective for the state to let these counties secede.</p>
<p>It is generally believed, that secession also hinges upon a successful bill being passed in Congress. This could prove to be the major obstacle, because this government is run by and controlled by the forces of Agenda 21. Because of this latter reason, I do not expect that secession efforts of Northern California and Southern Oregon to succeed under the present set of circumstances.</p>
<p><b>Conclusion </b></p>
<p>This is clearly a beta test for Agenda 21 in which the globalists are perfecting the process of depopulating region and to make a profit in the process. By my latest count, there are no less than nine federal agencies working in unison to force these people off of their land. I think it is very likely that we are witnessing the model that Agenda 21 will pursue in subjugating world and wilderness areas and across the United States in the near future. However, I think that the federal government and their Agenda 21 benefactors may have miscalculated the outcome in which people may respond.</p>
<p>Trapped people and trapped animals typically respond in a very similar manner. Along these lines, Gerald Celente likes the following quote:</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>When people lose everything, they have nothing left to lose, and they lose it. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Very soon, the people of Northern California and Southern Oregon will have nothing left to lose. This will make them extremely dangerous to the federal government.</p>
<p>The people of Northern California and Southern Oregon are trapped between two very bad choices. They can choose to walk away from everything, face bankruptcy and be forced to start over in a lifestyle of which many of them are totally unfamiliar. Or, they can choose to try and somehow get by, most likely fail, face bankruptcy and be forced to start over in a lifestyle of which many of them are totally unfamiliar. Different choices resulting in the same outcome.</p>
<p>These are tough, resilient people. If they reach the point of having nothing to lose, they could very likely lose it and we may see this region of the country being the modern day Lexington and Concord in which the next “first shot heard around the world” is fired.</p>

<a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2013/01/avoiding-complications-and-death-from.html"><b>Activist Post</b></a></p>
<p>With flu cases in this city up tenfold from last year, the mayor of Boston declared a <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Health/hospitals-flooded-flu-patients-turn-chicago/story?id=18167245">public health emergency</a> on the 9th of January. Right behind them the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention declared that <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/u-faces-shortages-flu-vaccine-tamiflu-treatment-001511463.html;_ylt=Aohk_zIu.eO8Y5HFSfpCPBOs0NUE;_ylu=X3oDMTQyOWRwamFlBG1pdANTZWN0aW9uTGlzdCBGUCBVUwRwa2cDOTYwZGFlYjMtMjc4Mi0zYTk2LTlhZjUtNjZlMzZmYzE5ZWRkBHBvcwMyBHNlYwNNZWRpYVNlY3Rpb25MaXN0BHZlcgMxYmY3MGJhMC01YzE1LTExZTItODZmZi1hMzU3OWUzMWNjZDA-;_ylg=X3oDMTFpNzk0NjhtBGludGwDdXMEbGFuZwNlbi11cwRwc3RhaWQDBHBzdGNhdANob21lBHB0A3NlY3Rpb25z;_ylv=3">influenza has reached epidemic proportions</a> in the United States, with 7.3% of deaths last week caused by pneumonia and the flu. U.S. health authorities say the flu arrived about a month earlier than usual this year, and the flu strain making most people sick—H3N2—has a reputation for causing fairly severe illness, especially in the elderly and increasingly in the young. </p>
<p>Nothing is said, of course, about the year-by-year weakening of the population (through numerous and ingenious ways like poisoning of the public water supplies with fluoride, the immune depression from <a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/anti-therapeutic-action/vaccination-influenza">yearly flu vaccines</a>, increasing exposures to toxins in the environment, toxicity from pharmaceuticals prescribed by doctors, as well as accumulating nutritional deficiencies), all of which make unsuspecting individuals increasingly vulnerable to complications from the flu and from the flu vaccines that deliver a yearly toxic blow. </p>
<p><a name="more"></a>Dr. Charlotte Ingle is telling her cancer patients, “We would advise that all cancer and hematology patients receive the vaccine unless they have contraindicated allergies regardless of whether or not they are receiving chemotherapy. We have advised the patient that they should have a flu vaccine as well as the pneumonia vaccine.” This is not bad advice—this is medical insanity that will lead people <a href="http://drsircus.com/medicine/having-trouble-waiting-to-die-take-a-pharmaceutical-drug">closer to death’s door</a>. But that is what most pharmaceuticals do, so we should not be surprised. </p>
<div align="center">
<p>    <ins class="adsbygoogle" style="height: 90px;width: 728px"></ins></p>
<p>    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || ).push({});</p>
</div>
<p>
In the olden days, medically speaking, pediatricians and general practitioners understood that you don’t vaccinate a child who is already ill, even if they simply have a bad cold or light flu. It is obvious Dr. Ingle does not know or remember this medical wisdom and that vaccines do have a depressing effect on the immune system. In suggesting that her patients who are already struggling for their lives expose themselves to dangerous vaccines that can bring on the flu and even more complications, she is leading them closer to, not further away from death. Last I checked, that’s not what doctors are supposed to be doing. Truth be told—vaccines hold the potential power to kill the cancer patient before the cancer does. </p>
<p>The mercury in the flu vaccine would be contraindicated for cancer patients because the shot’s <a href="http://drsircus.com/medicine/cancer/heavy-metals-mercury-and-cancer">toxicity from heavy metals</a> adds to the chance that cancer will continue and get worse. <b>People with weak immune systems should not get vaccines that contain live viruses, mercury</b> or any vaccine for that matter. <a href="http://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatmentsandsideeffects/physicalsideeffects/infectionsinpeoplewithcancer/infectionsinpeoplewithcancer/infections-in-people-with-cancer-vaccines">Fatal infections</a> have been caused by giving live-virus polio, measles, and smallpox vaccines to patients with weak immune function. </p>
<p>Living with cancer <a href="http://m.cdc.gov/en/HealthSafetyTopics/DiseasesConditions/Cancer/Related/PreventingInfections/cancerFlu">increases your risk for complications</a> from influenza (“flu”). If you have cancer now or have had cancer in the past, you are at higher risk for complications from the seasonal flu or influenza, including hospitalization and death. This is especially true if you are having surgery, chemotherapy or radiation. Cancer patients should be on a radical protocol of medicinals that can quickly increase their resistance to infection. Allopathic medicines are more than worthless in this regard. </p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both;text-align: center"><a href="http://activistpost.net/vaccinetruth.html" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em" target="_blank"><img alt="" height="175" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-38G3VOJQToQ/TfAZ2bc-qRI/AAAAAAAAJQ8/LA-TGAvVeWk/250x250-b.jpg" width="200"></a></div>
<p>Flu (seasonal influenza) is NOT to be mistaken for the common cold. Although the flu may seem like a minor illness, it is a serious respiratory infection that can lead to severe complications and even death. That’s the official word from the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/qa/coldflu.htm">Centers for Disease Control</a> and they are correct especially if you do not treat it appropriately. </p>
<p>“People tend to underestimate the effects of flu (and doctors underestimate the dangers of vaccines), but it puts several hundred thousand people in the hospital every year. It can kill up to 50,000 people every year, and there are certain groups—people with underlying medical conditions, the elderly and the very young—who are at risk for severe illness from flu,” said Dr. Michael Jhung, a flu expert at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. </p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>Although it varies widely from year to year, the government and the medical establishment makes a point of scaring the public enough so they are herded in large numbers into getting their dangerous and unnecessary flu shots. They do not want the public to understand anything about the flu and what to do about it; they only want you to silently and obediently comply and get your flu shot. </p>
<p>“This is a bad year. There’s no question about it,” said <a href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/national/2013/01/flu-season-2013/60799/">Dr. William Hanage</a>, an associate professor of epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health. Dr. Hanage also admits the poor percentage of people for whom vaccines are effective. It’s a bad year because doctors simply ignore treatments that make sense. They are correct to warn about the dangers but they fail to give the whole picture: </p>
<p>More than half a million U.S. children yearly have bad reactions or side effects from widely used medicines that require medical treatment and sometimes hospitalization. </p>
<p>The study appears in October’s 2009 Pediatrics. It’s based on national statistics on patients’ visits to clinics and emergency rooms between 1995 and 2005. The number of children treated for bad drug reactions each year was mostly stable during that time, averaging 585,922. </p>
<p>There is no unequivocal scientific support to the belief and/or propaganda that flu vaccines are safe and effective. And there is a conspicuous absence of conclusive evidence as to the effectiveness of influenza vaccines in <a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/article/inactivated-flu-vaccines-have-not-been-proven-be-effective-or-safe-preventing-influenza-heal">children under two</a>, <a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/article/there-little-evidence-supporting-belief-vaccines-are-effective-preventing-influenza-healthy-">healthy adults</a>, <a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/article/there-no-solid-evidence-available-supporting-belief-vaccines-are-effective-preventing-influe">the elderly</a>, or <a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/article/influenza-vaccination-healthcare-workers-who-work-elderly-has-no-effect-laboratory-proven-in">healthcare workers who care for the elderly</a>. </p>
<p>We have to conclude from hard medical data the obvious: It makes no sense to treat the complications of influenza with drugs backed by no evidence supporting their benefit while at the same time offering a range of dangerous side effects. </p>
<p><b> Natural Allopathic Emergency Medicine </b></p>
<p>An intelligent protocol against influenza involves the use of the basic emergency room and intensive care medicines that are an integral part of Natural Allopathic Medicine. Magnesium chloride, iodine, <a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/substance/sodium-bicarbonate">sodium bicarbonate</a>, <a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/substance/selenium">selenium</a>, <a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/substance/vitamin-c">vitamin C</a> and <a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/substance/vitamin-d">vitamin D3</a> (if possible through sun exposure) are all medicines that help patients resist and even avoid dangerous complications from the flu. So does breathing retraining as this aids in increasing CO2 and O2 levels, and of course the application of full hydration therapy is essential. </p>
<p>The primary symptoms of a cytokine storm (what kills the patient with influenza) are high fever, swelling and redness, extreme fatigue and nausea. In some cases the immune reaction may be fatal. To stop the cytokine storms and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)<a href="http://drsircus.com/medicine/flu/avoiding-complications-and-death-from-influenza#_edn1">[1]</a> that can lead to death, we have to turn away from the orthodox medical responses of using vaccines and drugs like Tamiflu. In Dec. 2012 the <a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/fda-approves-neurotoxic-flu-drug-infants-less-one">FDA approved Tamiflu</a> for use in two-week-old babies. Now people are clamoring for this drug and <a href="http://www2.wjbf.com/news/2013/jan/09/shortes-tamiflu-csra-ar-5332676/">shortages</a> are being reported; all this despite the fact that Tamiflu has been shown to cause <a href="http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2012/02/07/recommended-tamiflu-has-flawed-results.aspx">adverse effects</a> and at best only shortens a bout of the flu by about one day. </p>
<p>Nutrient deficiency is one of the main reasons for a cytokine storm in response to a virus like H1N1, along with heavy metals and other chemicals that are flooding out of the cells when one has the flu. Many naturopaths have always seen the flu as a detox dump because as the body detoxifies, it is not uncommon to experience flu-like symptoms. (Some people also make a direct relation with Chemtrails painting the skies with Ethylene Dibromide and the flu epidemic.) </p>

<p>Anti-inflammatory therapy, antioxidant therapy, full hydration and increasing the CO2 and thus O2 levels of the blood and tissues constitutes a natural form of treatment that can make a difference starting from the first hours that treatments are applied.</p>
<p><b>Sodium Bicarbonate (Baking Soda) </b></p>
<p>“In 1918 and 1919 while fighting the ‘Flu’ with the U. S. Public Health Service it was brought to my attention that rarely anyone who had been thoroughly alkalinized with <a href="http://drsircus.com/medicine/flu/sodium-bicarbonate-common-cold-and-influenza-virus">bicarbonate of soda</a> contracted the disease, and those who did contract it, if alkalinized early, would invariably have mild attacks. I have since that time treated all cases of ‘cold,’ influenza and ‘la gripe’ by first giving generous doses of bicarbonate of soda, and in many, many instances within 36 hours the symptoms would have entirely abated,” wrote <a href="http://drsircus.com/medicine/sodium-bicarbonate-baking-soda/arm-hammer-soda-company">Dr. Volney S. Cheney</a> to the Arm &amp; Hammer Company.</p>
<p><b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A0LE6O/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=permacultucom-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000A0LE6O">Vitamin D</a> Will Protect Against the Flu </b></p>
<p>One of the greatest triggers of influenza, the swine flu and deaths from pulmonary deficiency is vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D reduces the risk of dying from all causes including the flu. <a href="http://drsircus.com/medicine/flu/vitamin-d-and-the-flu">Researchers</a> from Winthrop University Hospital in Mineola, New York found that giving supplements of vitamin D to a group of volunteers reduced episodes of infection with colds and flu by 70% over three years. The researchers said that the vitamin stimulated “innate immunity” to viruses and bacteria. </p>
<p><b>Iodine </b></p>
<p>“Extremely <a href="http://drsircus.com/medicine/iodine/iodine-rescue">high doses of iodine</a> can have serious side effects, but only a small fraction of such extreme doses are necessary to kill influenza viruses,” writes Dr. David Derry of Canada.<a href="http://drsircus.com/medicine/flu/avoiding-complications-and-death-from-influenza#_edn2">[2]</a> In 1945, a breakthrough occurred when J. D. Stone and Sir McFarland Burnet (who later went on to win a Nobel Prize for his Clonal Selection Theory) exposed mice to lethal effects of influenza viral mists. The lethal disease was prevented by putting iodine solution on mice snouts just prior to placing them in chambers containing influenza viruses. Dr. Derry reminds us that a long time ago students in classrooms were protected from influenza by iodine aerosol therapy. Aerosol iodine also is effective against freshly sprayed influenza virus. </p>
<div style="float: right;margin-left: 1em;margin-bottom: 0em"></div>
<p><b> Selenium </b></p>
<p>Selenium is a strong antioxidant anti-inflammatory that can also be used. Protection against reperfusion injury, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, vascular surgery, are all alleviated with selenium injections as would cytokine storms provoked from out of control infections. </p>
<p>The clinical investigations in sepsis studies indicate that higher doses of selenium are well tolerated as continuous infusions of selenium as sodium selenite (4,000 μg selenium as sodium selenite pentahydrat on the first day, 1,000 μg selenium/day on the nine following days) and had no reported toxicity issues. In view of this new information, <a href="http://biosyncorp.com/start/">Biosyn</a> introduced the 1,000 µg dose vials for such high selenium clinical usage. </p>
<p>Selenium is important because selenium-deficient mice developed much more severe lung pathology after infection with influenza virus than did selenium-adequate mice. In another study, when selenium-deficient mice were infected with a mild strain of influenza virus, the virus mutated to become a more virulent strain, one that caused severe lung pathology even in selenium-adequate mice. </p>
<p>Selenium is also an antidote to mercury having the highest affinity with it than any other atom. So selenium does double duty lowering mercury toxicity and this is important because mercury toxicity is known to provoke influenza. </p>

<p>Magnesium chloride (<a href="http://drsircus.com/medicine/magnesium/uses-of-magnesium-oil">magnesium oil</a>) has always been and remains my favorite medicine that affects overall physiology in a very positive and direct way. <a href="http://drsircus.com/medicine/infection-control-21st-century">Dr. Raul Vergini</a> says, “Magnesium chloride has a unique healing power on acute viral and bacterial diseases. It cured polio and diphtheria and that was the main subject of my magnesium book. A few grams of magnesium chloride every few hours will clear nearly all acute illnesses, which can be beaten in a few hours. <b>I have seen a lot of flu cases healed in 24-48 hours with 3 grams of magnesium chloride taken every 6-8 hours.</b>” </p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>Intravenous <a href="http://drsircus.com/medicine/cancer/using-vitamin-c-for-heart-disease-cancer-and-cell-protection">vitamin C</a> is a wonderful treatment when people are on the edge between life and death with the power to bring people back from the brink. Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) contributes a wide range of benefits. It is known to perform many critical functions within the body involving detoxification, tissue building, immune enhancement, pain control, and controlling or killing pathogenic organisms. It is also known to be helpful for wound and bone healing, healthy skin and eyes, fighting infections, stress control, toxic exposure, and repairing damaged tissue of all types.</p>

<p>Dr. Ben Whalley, at the department of pharmacy at the University of Reading, said tests in animals had shown the <b>marijuana compounds effective at preventing seizures and convulsions</b> while also having fewer side effects than existing epilepsy drugs. At the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Md., rat nerve cells were exposed to a toxin that is typically released during strokes. Cannabidiol reduces the extent of damage reported the National Academy of Sciences. More effective than vitamins C or E, strong antioxidants such as <a href="http://drsircus.com/medicine/medical-marijuana/buy-legal-medical-marijuana-cannabidiol-cbd-industrial-hemp">cannabidiol</a> (CBD) will neutralize free radicals without the accompanying high with regular marijuana used for recreational and other medical purposes. All forms or marijuana have anti-oxidative, neuroprotective, immunomodulation, analgesic and <b>anti-inflammatory actions</b>. </p>
<p>Beyond these core physiological protective mechanisms, something as simple as smoking <b>marijuana is ideal for the pain and discomfort of influenza</b>. With or without the “high,” <a href="http://drsircus.com/medicine/medical-marijuana">cannabinoid medicine</a> offers safe pain relief even as it heals and protects. It should be put into wide use in hospitals as well as in the home for routine treatment against the worst ravages of the flu. </p>

<p>Dr. Ester Fride strongly recommends the use of cannabinoids in pediatric medicine so what I am saying for adults above applies to children. She notes that “excellent clinical results” have been reported in pediatric oncology and in case studies of children with severe neurological diseases or brain trauma, and suggests that cannabis-derived medicines could also play a role in the treatment of other childhood syndromes, including the pain and gastrointestinal inflammation associated with cystic fibrosis. </p>
<p><b>Conclusion </b></p>
<p>There are nine things to do if you have the flu or are living in an epidemic area (all of the United States) that are put forth in this essay. Five of these things are emergency room ‘natural medicines’ that are injectable so there is no excuse for doctors and hospitals not to be using them. The rest of us can self-administer these medicines orally and apply them topically and even nebulize several of them for rapid, safe and even legally administered effect. </p>
<p>Of course there is always more but these nine should keep you and your nurse, if you are lucky enough to have one, extremely busy. It’s good to remember that pure water is the most basic medicine and it is not as easy as it seems to stay fully hydrated. Also for fifty dollars one can purchase a Russian designed <a href="http://drsircus.com/medicine/slow-steady-easy-breathing">breathing apparatus</a>, which you should have in your house anyway, that will slow your breathing down. It really is extremely difficult to die when one is breathing slowly! </p>

<b>In the emergency room medicines have to be safe while delivering an instant lifesaving burst of healing power</b>. The idea when used at home is to constantly be administering these medicinals during waking hours. The power and speed of these medicines and the flexibility of their administration methods make them ideal especially because of their extremely low-toxicity profiles. As usual the key to their use is in the dose given. </p>
<p>Few if any people need to die from the flu if they are treated correctly. In Treatment Essentials, dosages and concentrations and methods of application options are covered. When one learns about the above emergency room medicines, and how to use them, one gains a lot of medical power and wisdom to overcome diseases. (Treatment Essentials should be available in early February) </p>

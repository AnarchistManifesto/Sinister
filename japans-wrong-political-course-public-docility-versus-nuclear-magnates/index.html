<p>The Fukushima nuclear disaster may now reasonably be considered one of  the world’s worst man-made industrial accidents. How could those  responsible with the political power to prevent or treat the situation  pretend it didn’t happen and continue to roll merrily along?</p>
<p>In my last article I offered a few ideas about how Japan’s pro-nuclear  Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) reclaimed ruling control in the 2012  election (1). Just when the country needed rationality and courage of  vision, instead we now have the same old tired and failed remedies. That  is what is incorrectly called, “conservatism.” Is this a case of the  blind leading the stupid, or the true definition of insanity: Repeating  the same exercise over and over again expecting a different result.</p>
<p>Let’s recall the political situation during the March, 11, 2011  earthquake/tsunami/nuclear crisis that broadsided Japan. One can rightly  criticize former prime minister Naoto Kan, especially given his  scientific and technical expertise, which separates him from most other  politicians whose backgrounds are in law, for not having acted  aggressively enough to prevent the nuclear disaster. There was ample  evidence to suggest a nuclear disaster on the horizon but his party, the  Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), has never consistently pushed for a  program of renewable energy.</p>
<p>However, Kan, along with many other courageous workers involved,  deserves credit for preventing the worst case outcome of full blown  multiple and uncontrolled nuclear meltdowns from occurring. It was Kan’s  bold actions to prevent the dithering and ill-prepared cowards of Tokyo  Electric Power Company (Tepco) from abandoning the Fukushima No. 1  nuclear power station during the peak hours of the meltdowns. This is  verified not only by Kan’s own account but by sources in mainstream  media. Had Kan’s government allowed Tepco to abandon the plant, “50  million people would have to be evacuated within a few weeks…. The  very announcement to evacuate would result in mass panic” (2).</p>
<p>Some argue that even if Tokyo need not have been evacuated (given the  worst was avoided), the Fukushima region should have been. Since most of  the region was not may be seen as a failing or blatant cover-up on the  part of the Kan administration.</p>
<p>Putting that issue aside, what happened then?</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>For months after the  accident the nuclear establishment and their bloodhounds in the media  attacked Kan’s increasingly pronounced, anti-nuclear political stance.  Like a crane that maneuvers to remove fragile spent fuel rods from a  damaged fuel pool, Kan was hoisted by his shirt collar with pincers and  tossed aside into the nuclear rubble. As if according to a script  written by the nuclear establishment, Kan was first replaced by the more  malleable Mr. Noda, who has now been replaced by the hardline  pro-nuclear (and pro-war) prime minister, Shinzo Abe.</p>

New revelations may help to explain this wrongheaded course driven by a  political regime whose economic and energy policies are more akin to a  demolition derby than a modern democracy.</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>A survey conducted by the Tokyo Shimbun newspaper, just before the  [December, 2012] elections … showed that more than 60 per cent wanted  to phase out nuclear energy completely…. By promising to pour resources  into promoting alternative energy development and to develop an optimal  energy mix over the next decade ‘the LDP kept their position on nuclear  energy ambiguous before the elections’, says Norimichi Hattori of the  Tokyo-based Metropolitan Coalition Against Nukes. But ‘since the Abe  administration was formed, their rhetoric on nuclear power has changed  quite rapidly’, says Koichi Nakano, professor of political science at  Sophia University in Tokyo. ‘It now looks like the LDP feels it is their  duty to promote nuclear energy,’ Mr Nakano says (3).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This helps to explain why the gullible public voted LDP: LDP lied to  them. People should have known better given LDP history of involvement  with the nuclear industry. Even though he was always financially tied to  the nuclear industry, ex-mayor of Tokyo, Shintaro Ishihara, blamed the  3-11 disaster on the Japanese people as a punishment from God!  Incredibly, voters reelected him just after 3-11 despite his blaming of  them for the tsunami.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/teslasecret/" style="float: right;margin-left: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em"><img class="noshadow" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/_qLAIskTQXUc/TaqAcrCPlhI/AAAAAAAAISQ/5uq527jnmDM/book-shape.jpg" style="background:none" alt=""></a>Duncan Baker, who is a professor and expert on global politics, recently  remarked to me that during last year’s election season, he witnessed  the LDP giving speeches in his neighborhood of Tokyo. Most of the crowd  was old folks and they were enthralled by the candidates, crowding  around to shake their hands. The old folks did not possess sophisticated  political views and believe that since it was under the LDP that  Japan’s economic miracle occurred, we can forget about how they  squandered all that capital, and all their other blunders and broken  promises, not to mention their crucial role in developing Japan’s  nuclear power industry which led to the Fukushima catastrophe.</p>

<p>To give it the LDP that extra oomph, it may be they were helped not only  by Voter Dementia Syndrome (VDS) but also election rigging (4).</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>[T]here have been so many reports from the general public through  twitter and blogs on allegations of election rigging in the last one  month. Lots of voting places closed 1-4 hours earlier without any  notice.  Normally in Japan about 60% of the population goes to vote but  this time so many people said there were very long queues outside the  building. 85% of the nation doesn’t want nuclear energy, yet none of the  political parties that support a nuclear free society did not do  well…. [O]ne company called MUSASHI CO., LTD dealt with the whole  election: from counting votes to publicity; there is speculation that  this company has something to do with nuclear power.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While lacking confirmation from another source, it appears that only one  company “dealt with the whole election” and this is highly suspicious.</p>
<p>Centralized control of public elections by private entities flies in the  face of transparency and good governance and opens up the Pandora’s box  for political skullduggery.</p>
<p>As soon as Abe took office, the previously  compromising stance on nuclear power quickly and decisively shifted.</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has stated unequivocally for the first time  that his government will endorse the construction of new nuclear power  plants, while seeking to win over the public on this issue. ‘I will take  a levelheaded look at what caused the nuclear crisis at [Tokyo Electric  Power Co.’s] Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant and other factors….  Any new nuclear plant would be completely different from the old  Fukushima No. 1 plant, which was constructed 40 years ago…. We will  build new nuclear power plants and seek to win the people’s  understanding (5).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The LDP is confident about not only restarting existing nuclear  reactors, but building new ones on an archipelago as wobbly as a plate  of tofu. Does Abe have a level head or a bumpy brain? Abe stated at a  press conference that “[c]oncerning the problem of the disposal of spent  nuclear fuel, there is a necessity for the state/government to take  responsibility to accelerate deliberations” (6). This is blatant,  blame-shifting blather and ignores the profoundly difficult and so far  conveniently unanswered question of nuclear waste, especially in Japan  where deep ground burial is out of the question due to seismic  volatility.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/stirlinggenerator.html" style="float: right;margin-left: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-S-5zW068uEk/UFYDSijvYrI/AAAAAAAARu8/U_QYOrwWL68/s200/150X200_2.gif" alt=""></a>Another aspect of the LDP’s victory is the inadequate response of  Japan’s anti-nuclear movement. While the summer of 2012 had a number of  large and lively protests around the country, the movement did not have  staying power and was probably infiltrated and eradicated by its  detractors, which typically happens to popular Japanese reform  movements.</p>
<p>A case in point, in an article about the anti-nuclear agenda, a panelist  in a discussion group, “Ikuo Gonoi, associate professor of political  science at Takachiho University in Tokyo, highlighted the need for the  public to become involved in politics through means other than  demonstrations. ‘In the future, they should also join hands with LDP  lawmakers whom they can work with,’ Gonoi said of antinuclear activists”  (7).</p>
<p>Gonoi then recommends that we “join hands with LDP lawmakers”? The  professor makes a good point that people need to get involved in  political decision making, but other than the laudable Mr. Taro Kono,  Gonoi does not mention any progressive-minded LDP members (8). The  system, just like voting, is rigged against substantive public  participation. The gullible Japanese public are following in the  footsteps of the American sheep, turning into the Japanese version of  American Idiot rather than manifesting the courage and taking the risks  associated with public protest even when it concerns their very  survival. The biggest demonstration during the summer of 2012 was a huge  crowd of older folks in Yoyogi park, but they did little other than sit  in the hot sun and listen to speeches. Most young Japanese people today  are addicted to the iPhone and pop culture, and do not care a whit  about radiation in their fish dinner.</p>
<p>Additional reasons for the LDP victory include the simple fact that “The  LDP Didn’t Win: Everyone Else Lost” (9). The DPJ were disgraced by lack  of direction and other newer, smaller parties were not able to garner  enough money and attention to make headway. Japan nuclear politics  expert, Jeff Kingston recently posed an eyebrow raiser:</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>Given the unpopularity of the Noda government, and overwhelming public  support for the zero option, it is revealing that the DPJ has not played  the anti-nuclear card to woo voters. While the DPJ nominally takes an  antinuclear stance, its actions have been quite supportive of nuclear  energy and not consistent with its pledge to phase out nuclear energy.  This signifies that political leaders are more willing to risk public ire than defy the nuclear village (10).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Politicians know who butters their bread, and it is corporate campaign  contributions and the nuclear industry that own them. The website  “Simply Info” reports that voters are often confused by all the lies and  “the standard corporate talking points of the nuclear power industry.</p>
<p>* Renewables can’t provide enough energy<br />
* The world needs more energy than it currently consumes<br />
* Dismisses the risks of nuclear power by comparing it to fossil fuel dangers<br />
* Citing nuclear as ‘the solution’ to climate change” (11).</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>Kyodo News mentions that 9 industries in Japan want the nuclear plants  turned back on. They specifically name 2 of them. ‘Nine industry bodies  including the Japan Iron and Steel Federation and the Japan Mining  Industry.’ It has been proven that Japan does not have an energy  shortage after threats of blackouts failed to happen. The costs and  consequences of nuclear power are shouldered by the people yet it has  become apparent they are not the major consumers of energy. In most  developed countries industry is the largest user of energy. Yet when  energy policy is discussed it largely revolves around residential &amp;  commercial needs to conserve and rate hikes on those rate categories.  The industries pushing the government to restart reactors are also the  largest consumers of electricity yet shoulder little of the total risk  posed by these reactors… (12).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Consumers are simply being told they must support obsolete energy  production in order to prolong the gigantic rip-off being perpetrated on  them as energy prices continue to skyrocket in a transparent grab for  the last yen before the curtain falls on this criminal activity, and  fall it will.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/homemadeenergy.html" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em" target="_blank"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_qLAIskTQXUc/TXgTaORM3wI/AAAAAAAAHbc/BmcggFdysuM/homemade175.gif" alt=""></a>Indeed, nuclear power is “45 times more costly” than burning coal for  energy, and gas is also cheaper than nukes (13).</p>
<p> Let us not forget the  billions of dollars the nuclear industry has pumped into the public  airways telling us nuclear power is safe– in Japan alone spending 27.6  billion dollars over four decades on pro-nuke advertising (14).</p>
<p>And now  they also pump trillions of becquerels of deadly radiation into the  Pacific ocean from the melted-down and severely damaged Fukushima  reactors (15).</p>
<p>I’ve heard many knuckleheaded nuclear excuses presented by college  students, whom, when asked where they got their information, lamely  reply “the Internet.” Information is now just one big glob, shreds of  which are obtained from “wikipedia” or “the Internet” without any  distinction as to the quality, reliability or bias of the source. One of  the universities I work at is building the country’s largest university  library, but students no longer read books, everything is digital these  days.</p>
<p>With Abe now in the driver’s seat, my colleague Tony Boys wrote to me  that “the LDP – the political wing of nuclear fascism in Japan – will be  able to do whatever they want for the next four years. Nuclear power  plant restarts; positive action on behalf of the nuclear cycle,  including reprocessing, fast-breeder reactors; collusion with the power  companies to hide inconvenient data; harassment of anti-nuclear  organizations and activists, you name it” (16).</p>
<p>There is some hopeful news. Although Japan’s newly created Nuclear  Regulation Authority is mainly made up of the same old bureaucrats that  staffed previous nuke agencies, they may have learned some lessons and  are proposing that science and safety, not politics, should dictate  Japan’s nuclear future (17; 18; 19). Let’s hope they can force through  tough reforms to the broken system.</p>
<p>Don’t worry folks, if you feel alienated by the fraudulent and  meaningless morass of sewerage known as the political process, the  Japanese government now has reassurances for your nuclear worries: We  can all live in radiation fallout shelters, and smiling helps ward off  radiation poisoning — “Japan To Set Up Fallout Shelters For Residents  Living Near Nuclear Power Plants” (20).</p>
<p>Since nuclear pollution travels around the globe, this means we are all  downwinders and may have to get ready to live in fallout shelters for  the sake of the profits of the nuclear magnates and their politician  lapdogs.</p>

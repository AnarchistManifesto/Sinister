<p><b>What Major Factor Causing “Climate Change” Are They Not Telling Us About?</b></p>
<p>More alarming articles and studies are surfacing each day which  confirm the rapidly changing state of Earth’s life support systems and  climate. Humanity has decimated the planet and the chickens are coming  home to roost. Though there are certainly many parts to this unfolding  story, the largest piece of the puzzle by far still goes completely  unacknowledged by most of the scientific community and all of the mainstream media/corporate/military/industrial complex. The massive elephant  in the room has been, and still is, “stratospheric aerosol  geoengineering” or “SAG”, AKA “chemtrails”.</p>
<p><b>What Is Stratospheric Aerosol Geoengineering And Why Is It So Dangerous?</b></p>
<p>Stratospheric aerosol geoengineering is a primary term for the  ongoing global climate modification programs being conducted by major  powers around the world. “Aerosols” is simply a term for microscopic  particles suspended in the air. The major component of the  geoengineering programs is to saturate the atmosphere by spraying  millions of tons of 10 nanometer (a nanometer is 1/1,000,000,000 of a  meter) toxic metal particles (aerosols) from jet aircraft. Why? Based on  available data, there are a number of known objectives, though it is  very likely much of the agenda associated with these programs can only  be speculated on.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><b>Many geoengineering patents have a stated goal of slowing global warming.</b></p>
<p>Aluminum/alumina, among other toxic metals, is showing up in  countless rain tests around the world. The amount of aluminum, barium,  and other metals in these rain/snow tests is always high and often  completely off the charts. <a href="http://www.fourwinds10.net/siterun_data/environment/pollution/news.php?q=1220410300" target="_blank">Snow</a><a href="http://www.fourwinds10.net/siterun_data/environment/pollution/news.php?q=1220410300" target="_blank"> tests from Mt. Shasta</a>  in Northern California were toxic beyond belief. This area of the  Pacific Northwest was thought to be a pristine water source. Dozens of  rain samples taken in this region from numerous individuals were <a href="http://www.geoengineeringwatch.org/tests/" target="_blank">tested at the State certified lab</a>  in Northern California and showed shocking results without exception.  Former US Forest Service Biologist Francis Mangles has confirmed the  alarming heavy metal contamination with <a href="http://foodintegritynow.org/2011/03/07/food-integrity-now-francis-mangels-chemtrails-e36/" target="_blank">his own testing</a>.  Snow tests taken from the side of Mt. Shasta showed aluminum content as  high as 61,000 PPB. (parts per billion). This level of aluminum in the  snow is tens of thousands of times anything that might be considered  “normal background” contamination.</p>
<div align="center">
<p>    <ins class="adsbygoogle" style="height: 90px;width: 728px"></ins><br />

<p>
Levels this high can only be considered highly toxic. Since these  toxic metals are in the snow, they can only come from the air.  Aluminum/alumina in “free form” does not naturally exist in the  environment but is always bonded to other elements. So where is it  coming from? Aluminum is the primary element named in numerous  geoengineering patents. The same patents that describe dispersing this  aluminum from jets for the expressed purpose of blocking the sun which  is exactly what we see aircraft “trails” doing in our skies day in and  day out.</p>
<p>It is important to remember this contamination is not local, but  global in scope. Movements have formed in countries all over the world  which are desperately trying to address this dire issue.</p>
<p><b>Shrinking Atmosphere, Disturbed Hydrological Cycle, Fungal Proliferation and Species Extinction</b></p>
<p><a href="http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2008/05/29/202679/science-geo-engineering-scheme-damages-the-ozone-layer/?mobile=nc" target="_blank">Ozone layer damage</a> is yet another known consequence of geoengineering the atmosphere. Other recent studies now note a <a href="http://news.discovery.com/earth/earth-atmosphere-shrinking.html" target="_blank">“shrinking atmosphere”</a> which is very possibly also linked to the ongoing geoengineering programs.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/ultimatesurvivalplan.html" style="float: right;margin-left: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em" target="_blank"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-CTsdDqKcvhI/T7GjToaksaI/AAAAAAAAO2s/8vEb9HmqOhk/s316/160x316.gif" alt=""></a>The “hydrological cycle” of the planet is being completely disrupted  by the geoengineering aerosol saturation of the atmosphere. Fungal  proliferation is yet another inevitable crisis when the atmosphere is  filled with particulates, soils are contaminated with the geoengineering  fallout, and waters are polluted with the same. Already, <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/pandemics/2012/12" target="_blank">countless species are feeling the effects</a>. The current <a href="http://cmsdata.iucn.org/downloads/species_extinction_05_2007.pdf" target="_blank">“species extinction rate”</a>  should be absolutely shocking to all. At the present time the  “extinction rate” is from 1000 to 10,000 times “natural variability”.  This is from 100,000% to 1,000,000% of “normal background rates”. Though  mainstream media would never discuss this, we are currently in the  sixth <a href="http://www.dailygalaxy.com/my_weblog/2008/02/the-6th-great-m.html" target="_blank">mass extinction on planet Earth</a>.  Is geoengineering responsible for all of this? Of course not all, but  if the available science and data is considered, geoengineering is  likely by far the single  most significant cause of environmental and  climate devastation.</p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>If all available information is considered, geoengineering appears to  be the greatest and most immediate threat to all life on Earth short of  nuclear catastrophe.</p>
<p><b>Less Rain, Less Wind, Less Sun, Welcome To Geoengineering</b></p>
<p><b>Aerosol Saturated Skies – The New Norm</b></p>
<p>Though rain and snow is falling in areas of North America, at times in a deluge or “blizzard”, the <a href="http://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/" target="_blank">droughts in the continental US </a>(  and many other regions around the globe), are getting worse. There are  now often massive areas of drifting cloud cover spanning thousands of  miles over land masses and oceans with very little precipitation. Why is  this? Why are the skies so often completely featureless as these  expansive cloud banks and upper level “haze” drift across the globe? If  individual clouds can be recognized in these “drifting masses”, they  often appear “melted into” the upper story of geoengineering “haze”.</p>
<p>Why  is the wind often diminished under these featureless canopies? Horizon-to-horizon geoengineering trails are not the only sign of spraying.  Clouds should be “white” and the sky “blue”. Wispy, dingy, cobweb like  upper level “clouds” are are not natural and another hallmark of  spraying, as are “silvery white” skies.</p>
<p><b>The Geoengineering Connection</b></p>
<p><a href="http://news.stanford.edu/pr/2007/pr-slowwind-012407.htmlhttp://news.stanford.edu/pr/2007/pr-slowwind-012407.html" target="_blank">Atmospheric aerosol saturation</a>  diminishes wind and precipitation. The conditions described above are  known consequences of stratospheric aerosol geoengineering (SAG) and  solar radiation management (SRM) . All available scientific data confirms  the effect of geoengineering particulates on rainfall. Though mainstream science sources are still not willing to openly admit to the fact  that geoengineering programs have been fully deployed for decades, a  growing mountain of evidence makes this fact all too clear. The ongoing  stratospheric geoengineering programs are <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/06/us-geoengineering-research-idUSBRE8550P020120606" target="_blank">greatly reducing overall rainfall</a> and all but eliminating <a href="http://www.climatecentral.org/news/geoengineered-sky-bye-bye-blue-hello-white" target="_blank">deep blue skies</a>.  Blocking the sun with reflective geoengineering aerosols reduces  evaporation. Wind is reduced significantly from atmospheric aerosol  saturation as the particles scatter solar energy and thus reduce  convection from the ground that would otherwise occur from daytime  heating. The slowing of the wind reduces evaporation even more. Further,  precipitation cells that do form are often dispersed and diminished  from the excessive amount of geoengineering particulates. This causes to  many “condensation nuclei” and the droplets do not combine and fall as  rain but migrate on.</p>
<p>It is important to remember that there are ALWAYS exceptions to the  geoengineering consequences outlined in scientific study. There are  simply far too many variables in the extremely complex climate system.  Colliding air masses, strong weather fronts, tornadoes, hurricanes, etc.,  are all among such variables that can still produce devastating and  destructive winds and rains even with extensive geoengineering.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/familysurvival.html" style="float: right;margin-left: 1em;margin-bottom: 0em"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ASIFGy_z7zU/UCFiDQK8GBI/AAAAAAAAROU/7AHejVY_hUE/s202/3.gif"></a><b>Global Dimming, The Loss Of Blue Skies</b></p>
<p>There is a mountain of scientific data to confirm the reality of  “global dimming”. Most have never even heard the term much less noticed  the effect over recent decades. Though articles from <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2003/dec/18/science.research1" target="_blank">mainstream publications admit to the “global dimming” issue</a>,  most understate the percentage of dimming, and all point the finger at  “pollution particulates” as the sole cause. Countless jet aircraft which  criss-cross our skies daily, dispersing millions of tons of toxic metal  and chemical particulates, are completely ignored by all mainstream  media journalists and sources.</p>
<p>To date, mainstream media has done its best to avoid even mentioning  the subject of geoengineering much less admitting to these ongoing  programs of total planetary devastation. The overall ramifications from  global dimming and geoengineering cannot be accurately quantified. Loss  of photosynthesis, destruction of the ozone layer, reduction in global  rainfall, loss of blue sky, toxification of soils and waters, these are  only a few of the known consequences of the global atmospheric spraying</p>
<p><b>Greatly Diminished Atmospheric Protection From The Sun</b></p>
<p>What does this imply? As already documented above, saturating the  atmosphere with particulates shreds the protective layers of the  atmosphere, namely the ozone layer. Particulate saturation in the upper  atmosphere causes a chemical reaction which does the damage. There is  now a massive <a href="http://news.nationalpost.com/2011/10/02/unprecedented-ozone-hole-opens-over-canadian-arctic/%20Solar%20storms" target="_blank">Northern hemisphere ozone hole</a>  in addition to the Southern Hemisphere hole we have all heard about for  decades. Stratospheric aerosol geoengineering is in all likelihood the  primary cause of the global ozone depletion, not just “CFC’s” as we have  been told.  Again, this has already been cited above and can be easily  researched. Search “geoengineering damages ozone layer”. All available  science makes this point clear. Without the ozone layer, life in any  form would likely not exist on our planet.</p>
<p>There is yet one more issue related to the destruction of our natural  protection from the sun’s usual radiation output: protection from solar  flares. Coronal mass ejections or “CME’s” can and will do <a href="http://mobile.wnd.com/2013/01/solar-storm-aftermath-2-trillion-in-fixes/" target="_blank">horrific damage to our planet</a>  and most especially human infrastructure. If electricity grids are shut  down due to a strong CME, the potential dangers are sobering indeed.  With no grid power to cool nuclear power facilities for an extended  time, we could face Fukushima x 100, or 200, or more. Without cooling,  meltdowns would eventually occur. Just one major nuclear catastrophe  could exterminate life on the planet, let alone dozens or hundreds of  them. Geoengineering is destroying our natural protection from such an  event caused by a strong coronal mass ejection.</p>
<p><b>Wind Pattern Changes And Catastrophic Methane Release</b></p>
<p>Wind current pattern changes in turn trigger ocean current changes.  Most are completely unaware of the wind and ocean current changes  occurring around the globe. Even fewer are aware of the ramifications  which are already unfolding from these changes.<br />
<a href="http://www.geoengineeringwatch.org/recent-changes-to-the-gulf-stream-causing-widespread-gas-hydrate-destabilization/" target="_blank"><br />
Ocean current changes are already delivering warmer waters</a> to  regions with vast undersea methane deposits. These deposits are known as  “methane hydrate” deposits and literally hold life on earth in the  balance. Many regions around the globe are beginning to expel methane  from hydrate and clathrate deposits. The East Siberian Shelf of the  Arctic is already releasing en masse. All available data indicates that  this event alone is changing our biosphere by the day. Though groups of  scientists like the “Arctic Methane Emergency Group”  <a href="http://www.ameg.me/" target="_blank">(AMEG)</a>  are calling for “emergency wartime scale geoengineering to avert  planetary catastrophe”, available data indicates that the very  geoengineering programs they are selling as a cure, are more likely a  major causal factor in triggering the methane catastrophe in the first  place. The fully deployed planetary geoengineering programs have been  altering wind and rain patterns at an ever increasing level for decades.  Again, it is these alterations that have likely been a major factor in  the triggering of mass methane release due to the altered ocean currents  and altered hydrological cycles from the ongoing geoengineering  programs.</p>
<p>Saturation of the atmosphere with methane is equivalent to covering  the planet with a sheet of glass. The sun’s thermal energy gets in, but  does not get out. Though most articles on methane release state methane  to be 20 times more potent a greenhouse gas than Co2, this is over a 100-year time horizon. Over a ten-year time horizon, methane is at least  100 times more potent. Again, the implications from this event alone  threaten all life on Earth.</p>
<p><b>No “Natural” Weather</b></p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/empsurvival.html" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-OXdpVcfytfk/UCq-RMfyLsI/AAAAAAAARZ0/ysoPUGqDNE4/s200/200x200_1.jpg"></a>The global geoengineering/weather modification/chemtrail programs  have likely been going on for over six decades. Recently found documents  from the <a href="http://www.geoengineeringwatch.org/a-recomended-national-program-in-weather-modification-icas-report-10a/" target="_blank">NASA archives</a>  indicate the these programs already had budgets into the hundreds of  millions of dollars even by the mid 1960s. These already massive  climate altering programs were radically ramped up in the last 15 years.  Though most of us alive today have perhaps known little truly “natural”  weather, what we are experiencing today is anything but natural. The  climate now “swings” radically from one extreme to another. It is now  common to have spring-like temperatures one day and snow (likely  artificially nucleated) the next. These “swings”or “fluctuations” are  getting ever more severe.</p>
<p><b>Manipulation Of The Jet Stream And The Shredding Of The Atmosphere</b></p>
<p>Is this really possible? Available science as well as observed weather events and jet stream “anomalies” say absolutely yes.</p>
<p><a href="http://govtslaves.info/destructive-weather-patterns-and-haarp-scientists-investigate-a-possible-connection/" target="_blank">HAARP</a>  is the acronym for a massively powerful “ionosphere heater” facility  located in Alaska. This is a huge and extremely powerful antenna array  which is capable of transmitting as much as a billion watts of power  into the ionosphere. The effect of this is to create a ‘bulge” in the  atmosphere which in turn can alter the course of the jet stream. Such  alterations can in turn “steer” weather systems. By such manipulation,  storm fronts can be combined and worsened into “frankenstorms”, or  broken apart and dispersed.</p>
<p>There are thought to be at least 18 of these “ionosphere heaters”  around the globe, some held by China and Russia. It has also become  evident in recent years that <a href="http://www.whale.to/b/snow.html" target="_blank">“weather warfare”</a>  is already a lethal global reality. The potential of these frequency  transmitter facilities is enhanced by the spraying of our skies. The  saturation of the atmosphere with metal particulates makes the  atmosphere more “conductive”. This in turn increases the capabilities of  the ionosphere heaters.</p>

<p>
<b>Dry Lightning And Out Of Control Forest Fires</b></p>
<p>An atmosphere that is more conductive from metal particulate  saturation can produce more frequent lightning. These same particulates  also have the net effect of “diminishing and dispersing” rain. Forests  around the globe are now filled with dead and dying trees. (referenced  later in this article). In addition, the foliage of trees are now  covered with what amounts to an “incendiary” dust from the  geoengineering particulates. Add the shredded ozone layer which creates  more heat, and the “weather modified” conditions are even worse. The  obvious result is more frequent and catastrophic forest fires. This  phenomenon is being played out around the globe. Summer of 2012 saw the  Northern Hemisphere burning down and now it is <a href="http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/01/07/16389641-australia-faces-catastrophic-days-as-wildfires-rage-in-5-of-countrys-6-states?lite" target="_blank">Australia and Tasmania</a> in meltdown.</p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p><b>Artificially Nucleated Snow Storms</b></p>

</div>
<p>Many will write this one off as impossible without any investigation.  That is a mistake as the science of chemical ice nucleation is very  established and commonly practiced in many arenas though it is hard to  comprehend this process being done on such a massive scale.</p>
<p>There are several <a href="http://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1403&amp;context=water_rep&amp;sei-redir=1&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Furl%3Fsa%3Dt%26rct%3Dj%26q%3D%2520process%2520of%2520generating%2520ice%2520nucleating%2520crystals%2520for%2520weather%2520modification%26source%3Dweb%26cd%3D2%26sqi%3D2%26ved%3D0CDkQFjAB%26url%3D%20http%253A%252F%252Fdigitalcommons.usu.edu%252Fcgi%252Fviewcontent.cgi%253Farticle%253D1403%2526context%253Dwater_rep%26ei%3DGDvdUOLUPOzpigLzmYDoCA%26usg%3DAFQjCNEhEx9SlnORqxZkeAJ-GBGnL8siZQ#search=%22process%20generating%20ice%20nucleating%20crystals%20weather%20modification%22" target="_blank">patents on “artificial ice nucleation for weather modification”</a>, including one from NASA.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/teslasecret/" style="float: right;margin-left: 1em;margin-bottom: 0em"><img class="noshadow" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/_qLAIskTQXUc/TaqAcrCPlhI/AAAAAAAAISQ/5uq527jnmDM/book-shape.jpg" style="background:none" alt=""></a>Artificially nucleated storms appear to be carried out under a myriad  of conditions. In many cases, storms that should have yielded only  rain, can be artificially nucleated to “change over” to snow. The term  “change over” has recently been coined by The Weather Channel and other  corporate/military/industrial complex weather agencies. A geoengineered  snow event is generally called “heavy wet snow” (another recent term).  This “snow” can begin to fall at temperatures far above freezing, though  the ongoing chemical process eventually cools the surrounding air mass.  The resulting “snow” and “ice” can sometimes remain a surprisingly long  time in spite of warmer temperatures, a result of artificial chemical  nucleation. This aspect of weather modification is covered in the  following article, <a href="http://www.geoengineeringwatch.org/geoengineered-snow-storms-wreaking-havoc-around-the-globe/" target="_blank">“Geoengineered Snow Storms Wreaking Havoc Around the Globe”</a></p>
<p><b>Temporary Cooling At The Cost Of A Worsened Overall Warming</b></p>
<p>This is the net result of geoengineering. Nature does not give  something for nothing. This should seem all too obvious, but  unfortunately the “scientists” in so many cases seem to be completely  blind to the facts. In the case of cloud seeding to produce rain, if  they succeed, then that moisture will not end up where it would have  otherwise gone. In the case of saturation spraying that is known to  diminish rain by scattering it into massive artificial cloud cover,  where will all that moisture end up? Coming down somewhere else in a  deluge? Is this perhaps why the US is locked in record drought and  England is having record rains?</p>
<p>The cooling effects of geoenigneering come at the cost of a much worsened overall warming of the planet. Even <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/langley/news/releases/2004/04-140.html" target="_blank">NASA admits the “condensation trails” (geoengineering particulate trails) are warming the planet</a>.</p>

<p>
<b>The Systemic Poisoning Of All Life On Earth</b></p>
<p>Sound like an “alarmist” statement or conspiracy theory? All  available data points to this conclusion as a hard and undeniable fact  for any that do objective research.</p>
<p>Countless lab tests of precipitation from around the globe (cited  above) have been done by concerned individuals and groups in recent  years, and the results are shocking to say the least. Our rain and snow  is quite literally packed with the very same highly toxic heavy metals  named in numerous geoengineering patents as primary elements. The air we  breathe is also laden with the same toxins aluminum/alumina, barium,  strontium, manganese, thorium, and now even fluoride is being reported  in recent tests from Norway. So much metal has fallen on the boreal  forests of the Pacific Northwest that soil PH changes of up to 15 times  more alkaline have been noted. A recent documentary film by filmmaker  Michael Murphy, <a href="http://www.whyintheworldaretheyspraying.com/" target="_blank">“Why In The World Are They Spraying” </a>covers some of these changes and the <a href="http://e360.yale.edu/feature/whats_killing_the_great_forests_of_the_american_west/2252/" target="_blank">forest die off</a>  that is occurring in boreal forests. Though there are countless  articles documenting the die-off of forests around the globe, putting  the blame only on increasing temperatures, drought, and beetles, none  mention geoengineering. To omit geoengineering in this equation is to  omit what appears to be the greatest factor of all. The lethal effects  of “bioavailable” aluminum/alumina in rainwater and thus <a href="http://forum.prisonplanet.com/index.php?topic=171457.10;wap2" target="_blank">in the soils</a> is well documented. Its <a href="http://e360.yale.edu/feature/whats_killing_the_great_forests_of_the_american_west/2252/" target="_blank">effect on trees</a> is also noted in science studies.</p>
<p>Off course there are corporations who exist to profit from calamity.  Monsanto always seems to be at the top of this list. As geoengineered  drought and aluminum sterilized soils force independent farmers to sell,  international ag corporations are there to buy up the land and put to  use there <a href="http://www.thomhartmann.com/forum/2010/05/monsanto-develops-aluminum-resistant-biotech-seeds" target="_blank">“aluminum resistant seeds.”</a></p>
<p><b>What Is Geoengineering Doing To Us?</b></p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/stepoutsidethebox.html" style="float: right;margin-left: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-kADbI3spO2M/TwILKt_It9I/AAAAAAAANvU/F0N-dw_gGR4/s261/cancer.png" alt=""></a>Inhalation of microscopic particulates is highly damaging no matter  what the particulate material. Respiratory ailments and mortalities are  now literally epidemic. Degenerative human diseases that are linked to  heavy metal exposure are even more lethal and are now going virtually  off the charts. ADD, Alzheimer’s, Autism, immune dysfunction, and  many other diseases associated with heavy metals, have all skyrocketed  in recent years. According to scientists like internationally know  neuroscientist <a href="http://www.thenhf.com/article.php?id=3298" target="_blank">Russell Blalock</a>,  the heavy metal nano particles are so small that they pass right  through the lung lining into the bloodstream. There they can adhere to  cell receptors like a plaque, slowly but surely shutting down bodily  functions and the immune system. These metals are all but impossible to  remove once they have become lodged in the body. In addition, virtually  every bite we eat is now contaminated with these toxic nano particles as  they are absorbed by plant life, which is highly <a href="http://climate-connections.org/2012/08/23/nanoparticles-pose-risk-to-food-crops/" target="_blank">damaging to crops</a>.</p>
<p>Stratospheric aerosol geoengineering (AKA chemtrails) has now tainted  all. Every breath we take, every bite we eat, all is contaminated. A  mountain of data, studies, and testing confirms this conclusion beyond  reasonable doubt.</p>
<p>We are all quite literally under assault. The threat to all life on  earth from the global weather modification programs cannot be  overstated. It is up to all of us to help in the task of bringing these  programs to light, and to a halt so the planet can begin to recover.  Arm yourself with copies or credible articles, data, and DVD copies.  <a href="http://www.whyintheworldaretheyspraying.com/"><i>Why In The World Are They Spraying?</i></a> by Michael Murphy is an excellent  tool for spreading the word on this most dire issue.</p>
<p>It is likely the vast majority of military and private sector people  involved with geoengineering do not understand the consequences.</p>
<p>Time is not on our side. Every day global geoengineering continues,  our odds are diminished. We must all pull together in the effort to  shine the light on this greatest of all human crimes. Once the  geoengineering issue is truly out in the open, and those who physically  carry out the spraying realize what they are a part of, we have a chance  to stop these lethal programs.</p>

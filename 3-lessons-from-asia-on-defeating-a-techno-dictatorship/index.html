<p><i>Defeating the deluge of draconian tech legislation requires a deeper and wider strategy. Asia provides both a model and a sanctuary. </i></p>
<p>Tony Cartalucci<br />
<b><a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2013/04/3-lessons-from-asia-on-defeating-techno.html">Activist Post</a></b></p>
<p>Without a doubt, 3D printing has  begun to shift paradigms. Already, small businesses are popping up  around the world, providing both the printers themselves, and services  for professional prototyping and small run production. Additionally,  local institutions called “<a href="http://localorg.blogspot.com/2012/11/what-is-makerspace.html">hackerspaces</a>,” are being built up in part around the the concept of personal manufacturing.  </p>
<p>3D printing may still appear to be a novelty – but if it is a novelty,  it is one that is poised to cross over into the mainstream, transforming  both the economy and society in profound ways. 3D printing has moved  beyond prototyping and has found itself amid <a href="http://www.cnet.com.au/3d-printed-robotic-hand-cuts-cost-of-prosthetics-339343192.htm">medical technology</a>, <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/anthony_atala_printing_a_human_kidney.html">biotechnology</a>, <a href="http://defensedistributed.com/">small arms manufacturing</a>, <a href="http://blog.ponoko.com/2011/05/14/aerospace-industry-adopting-3d-print-technology/">aerospace</a>, and <a href="http://singularityhub.com/2013/04/04/first-fully-3d-printed-building-may-take-shape-this-year/">even architecture</a>.  And 3D printing is just one of many emerging “disruptive technologies,”  so named because they “disrupt” established paradigms, often at the  expense of large multinational corporations, and to the benefit of  individuals and communities.  </p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both;text-align: center"><a href="https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/3d-printed-gun1.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em;margin-right: 1em"><img border="0" height="255" src="https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/3d-printed-gun.jpg" width="400"></a></div>
<p><i><b>Image</b>: 3D printing has gone from producing trinkets and  prototypes, to opening the door to architecture and small arms  manufacturing. The average person able to build shelter and a means of  self-defense, as well as many other necessities that form the foundation  of modern (and future) civilization, poses a direct threat to the  current establishment – not just in the West, but around the world.  </i></p>
<p>As the ability to access powerful technology reaches the desktop of mere  plebeians, predictably special interests are erecting firewalls in the  form of regulations, laws, taxes, and fear-mongering spread across the  corporate media.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>Pushing on the buttons of manufactured “hot issues”  like gun control – the fear of gun owners circumventing even the  strictest legislation by merely pushing “print” gives the establishment  “a foot in the door” to begin regulating and tempering the emergence of  personal manufacturing, just as it has done to justify SOPA, ACTA,  CISPA, and other draconian, monopolistic pieces of Internet legislation.<br />
<a href="http://www.blogger.com/null" name="more"></a><br />
There is no doubt that the establishment fears a universally armed  public it cannot disarm, but it is equally fearful of a public that is  able to print out goods that directly threaten their corporate  monopolies, and in turn, threaten the very source of their unwarranted  power and influence. </p>
<div align="center">
<p>    <ins class="adsbygoogle" style="height: 90px;width: 728px"></ins></p>
<p>    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || ).push({});</p>
</div>
<p>
But what happens when this technology spreads outside the reach of such  legislation? While immense corporate-financier interests race to  establish free-trade agreements that will lead to similar legislation  being implemented homogeneously worldwide, it appears the spread of 3D  printing and other disruptive technologies may be outpacing it. After  all, with the still relatively open Internet, a good idea, blueprint, or  set of instructions can reach the other side of the planet at the speed  of light while special interest supranational blocs can take decades to  construct.    </p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p><b>A Race Against Time</b></p>
<p>A properly educated, technically competent population with access to  personal manufacturing and a liberated Internet represents a landscape  upon which the seeds of monopolistic corporatism and artificial  socioeconomic disparity cannot take root. Therefore, creating a  landscape populated by uneducated, technically incompetent people,  without access to disruptive technology, has become a primary objective  of the establishment, openly pursued in a wide variety of ways.  </p>
<p>The push to implement bills like SOPA, ACTA, and CISPA represents an  effort that can, and already is, creeping into the realm of personal  manufacturing and other forms of disruptive technology. And while the  majority of the general population remains apathetic and/or oblivious to  the threat these regulations pose to their future, there are enough  people across the tech community who do recognize the threat and have  mobilized against it.</p>
<p>So effective has this opposition become, that the establishment has started targeting leaders amongst it. Most notably, <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/?p=9876">was the suspicious death of Aaron Swartz</a>, who (allegedly) committed suicide amidst a winning battle against the US government and its SOPA/ACTA legislation.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/teslasecret/" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-rzNOW9aAwJo/UCU8q_JTf6I/AAAAAAAARVY/m3xVnzzgCu0/s240/ad3.jpg"></a>However, as the battle continues across the West between increasingly  effective activists and special interests, the technological tools at  the center of it all have escaped beyond the battlefield and into  regions of the world where Western corporations and their rules and  regulations are neither recognized nor enforced. More specifically,  information technology and personal manufacturing is expanding across  Asia where the contrived concept of “intellectual property” (IP) has not  taken root and where “international laws” regarding IP are openly  flouted by both governments and the people.</p>
<p>While a series of controversial free-trade agreements seek to rectify this, including the contrivance of <a href="http://altthainews.blogspot.com/2013/01/asean-economic-community-is-opaque.html">ASEAN and the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC)</a>,  the amount of time required to both establish these supranational  entities, and produce the illusion of authority necessary to enforce the  subsequent laws and regulations they contrive, will leave an ample  window of opportunity open for a substantial disruptive  technology-driven alternative to take its place permanently.  </p>
<p>Now, there is a race against time for both corporate monopolies and the  tech community, to see who will establish their global paradigm first –  crass, stifling global consumerism, or open-technological progress. Asia  offers the tech community many lessons on how to win this race. While  the West appears to be crumbling in what its leaders call a “global  economic crisis,” many nations across Asia have weathered the crisis  with relative ease. And while the West’s tech communities fight a  relentless deluge of draconian tech legislation, people and businesses  across Asia openly flout the demands made by these very same corporate  monopolies. What is the key to their success? </p>
<p><b>Lesson 1: Collectively Circumventing the Law </b></p>
<p>Walk into any shopping center in Thailand, and you will find bootleg  goods, replicas, and “pirated” software openly on sale. Shoppers are  given the choice between authentic items and replicas, and between  copied software and licensed originals. Thais are quite proud of the  fact they have access to these goods at prices they can afford. Armed  police raids into markets selling these goods are rare, and generally  end with the police being driven out by angry sellers and buyers alike.  Meanwhile, expansive underground alternatives fill in any gaps left on  the even rarer occasion a police raid is successful.</p>
<p>It is not that there are no laws put in place by the <a href="http://altthainews.blogspot.com/2012/11/thailand-thaksin-shinawatras-foreign.html">bought-off politicians polluting Thailand’s political landscape</a>,  it’s that the government finds itself completely incapable of enforcing  them. This is because a culture of disregarding or circumventing  unreasonable, intrusive, and otherwise unnecessary laws is deeply rooted  not only in Thai culture, but across all of Asia. Even in Singapore,  with its reputation of strict law enforcement, there exists a thriving  underground economy the police frequently (and reasonably) look the  other way from.</p>
<p>Cultivating and promoting a similar attitude of collective dismissal of  unwarranted authority across the West is necessary. Also necessary is to  expose the hypocrisy of the Fortune 500’s constant bleating over the  merits of “free markets” and “competition” versus its hand wringing when  the tables are then turned by disruptive technology. This helps  illustrate the “color of law” by which they protect their monopolies and  the illegitimacy of the authority by which they attempt to enforce  self-serving legislation rammed through the Congress <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/?p=10288">by shamelessly bought-off representatives</a>. </p>
<p><b>Lesson 2: Embracing, Not Fearing Disruptive Technology</b></p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both;text-align: left"><a href="https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/musicsales_NoseDive1.gif" style="clear: left;float: left;margin-bottom: 0em;margin-right: 1em"><img border="0" height="150" src="https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/musicsales_NoseDive.gif" width="200"></a></div>
<p>The plummeting sales of media monopolies across the West, driven by  information technology and in spite of billions sunk into anti-file  sharing legislation, portend the fate of their counterparts across the  manufacturing and retail markets. It is a plummeting of not only sales  and profits, but of the unwarranted power and political influence such  sales and profits granted these monopolies.</p>
<p>Rather than conceding defeat to this new paradigm, and reforming  themselves to play a constructive role within it, special interests in  the West have decided, apparently, to fight it to the bitter end.  </p>
<p>In Asia, a different attitude has been generally adopted. As disruptive  technologies like 3D printing spread across Asia, they are being used to  enhance the existing economic paradigm and in doing so, will undercut  drastically foreign monopolies already losing ground in Asia.</p>
<p>The Economist is already in the early stages of hysteria regarding this shifting paradigm. It reported in its article, “<a href="http://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21576626-additive-manufacturing-growing-apace-china-new-brick-great-wall?frsc=dg%7Ca&amp;fsrc=scn/tw_app_ipad">A new brick in the Great Wall: Additive manufacturing is growing apace in China</a>,” that:  </p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>Western countries led the development of 3D printing, and the technique  has been praised by Barack Obama as a way to revive America’s  manufacturing industries. It may yet do so. But the extent to which that  revival will be brought about by the return to America of production  which has migrated to countries like China is harder to predict—for  China has plans of its own.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It continues by stating: </p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>The company also makes even smaller printers, called UP, which sell  for less than 6,000 yuan. Personal printers like these are helping to  create a Chinese version of the “maker movement”—a mixture of hobbyists  and craft producers who, finding that 3D-printing technology greatly  lowers the cost of going into production, are creating small  manufacturing businesses. The maker movement began in America, but it is  taking off in China too. Maker fairs are now being held in some of the  big cities. Officials seem happy to encourage this, and some talk of  introducing 3D printers into schools, to spark pupils’ interest in  careers in engineering.</p>
<p>3D printing is still a long way from replacing mass manufacturing.  But in China, as in America and Europe, the technology is changing the  way products are developed and made. And by lowering the cost of entry,  3D printing could herald yet another new generation of Chinese  manufacturing entrepreneurs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The choice to include in the title, the “Great Wall,” is a reference to  the West’s narrative that China is cutting itself off from the  “international community” and the process of “globalization.” It is  generally used in regards to China’s Internet, where Western tech  monopolies have been replaced by domestic alternatives, and Western  propaganda is outright blocked.</p>
<p>The fear is that the interdependent global neo-mercantilism paradigm  created by large corporate interests in the West will collapse if  nations like China, India, and nations across the West’s ASEAN AEC  project, decide to turn away from the continued exploitation of cheap,  unskilled human labor to fulfill Western consumerism, and instead toward  a more sustainable and equitable society based on education and  technology. </p>
<p>What scares the Economist most is the fact that China will be  introducing 3D printing across school curriculum, and is actively  encouraging the maker-community, inspiring and empowering an entire  generation of producers, rather than consumers. This national embracing  of disruptive technology in Asia is unseen in the West. </p>
<p>Disruptive technology gives both individuals and special interests  across Asia an advantage over a West that seeks to fold the region into a  greater geopolitical order. If given a choice between subservience to a  demonstrably treacherous West, or presiding over an independent nation  with an empowered population, albeit with more modest influence and  wealth, which will Asian leaders choose? It appears that in China, they  have elected the latter.   </p>

Instead, for the tech community in the West, just  as much effort and energy that is put into fighting draconian  legislation, should be put into building up local institutions within  communities, leveraging disruptive technology to do what the  establishment won’t or has categorically failed to do. This includes  providing jobs, better healthcare, shelter, superior education, and  collaborative spaces where pragmatic solutions can be developed for  real, immediate problems.</p>
<p>If the existing establishment won’t embrace this technology and use it for the greater good, <a href="http://localorg.blogspot.com/2012/12/decenralize-big-retail.html">create a local establishment that will</a>. </p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p><b>Lesson 3: Combining Disruptive Technology &amp; Traditional Grassroots Economics  </b></p>
<p>Asia still possesses a culture of local entrepreneurship. In Thailand,  nearly everyone, rich and poor, is engaged in entrepreneurial activity,  even if part-time, be it selling fruit on the sidewalk, running a bakery  out of one’s home, or turning the first floor of their townhouse into a  small factory, workshop, or classroom. It is not uncommon to see small  factories, bakeries, restaurants, tutoring houses, and grocery stores  side-by-side within a single block.</p>
<p>It is increasingly common to see many of these businesses leveraging  emerging technology not only to enhance their current grassroots  economic activity, but to open the doors to economic activity once the  sole realm of big-capital.</p>
<p>It is very clear what implications 3D printing and other forms of  disruptive technology will have in such a socioeconomic environment,  where zoning laws, rules, regulations, and taxes have yet to stifle  grassroots economics. </p>
<p>For the West’s tech community, taking advantage of this paradigm in Asia  and replicating it back at home can help undermine the financial and  political strength with which the establishment uses to repeatedly throw  legislation like SOPA, ACTA, and CISPA at the public. While challenges  surely face Westerners pursuing grassroots economics, the fact that it  works in Asia should be impetus enough to find loopholes and detours  around draconian legal obstacles. </p>

<p><b>Threats </b></p>
<p>Already, there are efforts to co-opt technological progress in Asia with US/EU-backed NGOs such as the farcical <a href="https://demworks.org/about">NDItech</a> front and its umbrella organization, the <a href="http://landdestroyer.blogspot.com/2012/12/syrias-internet-outage-future-of.html#uds-search-results">National Endowment for Democracy (NED</a>),   posing as progressive “netizens.” In reality, these NGOs seek to poison  well-meaning  activists across Asia who would otherwise have the education, knowledge,  and  enthusiasm to take up the cause of real activists like Aaron Swartz.  Instead of fighting for their own best interests, these dupes are led by  these NGOs through a system of institutionalized <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/?p=16564">flattery, funding, and aggrandizing</a>, to do the bidding of the West’s various foreign ministries and the corporate-financier interests they serve. </p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/familysurvival.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-wNo87rwTkak/T_Nf058z13I/AAAAAAAAQUg/zfQlS8HQtiw/s270/150x270.gif"></a>This in turn plays a contributing role in geopolitical strategies of tension represented by the <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/?p=15401">US’ insidious “pivot toward Asia</a>”  and political instability sown within individual Asian nations,  including Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, and China itself, seeking to  strangle progress long enough for special interests to catch up and  reassert themselves.</p>
<p>By convincing well-meaning people  that progress only comes in the form of “democracy,” “elections,” and  “political protest,” it is hoped that attention and energy can be  diverted entirely away from truly liberating technological pursuits. </p>
<p>Whether or not the West’s tech community realizes the importance of Asia  in their battle for Internet and tech-freedom, the corporate-financier  interests they are fighting have, and are already setting up camp.</p>
<p><b>A To-Do List </b></p>
<p>It is important for people across both the West and Asia to educate  themselves about all forms of disruptive technology, particularly 3D  printing, but also other emerging fields such as <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/?p=9969">synthetic biology</a>.  The key to ensuring these technologies are used for the best interests  of the people, is for the people themselves to understand them, use  them, and control them directly.</p>
<p>Both across the West and in Asia, <a href="http://hackerspaces.org/wiki/List_of_Hacker_Spaces">hackerspaces (see here for a complete list)</a>  and 3D printing operations are popping up. Visiting one of these  establishments would be a good first step for the average person to get  involved in supporting and contributing to this real revolution. </p>
<p>People must understand how powerful and profound this revolution is, and  why the establishment has been desperately trying to ensnare as many  well-meaning people as possible in distractions and false-causes, most  notably <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/?p=14780">the so-called “Arab Spring</a>.”  People must recognize attempts by the establishment to co-opt this  revolution, by following the money and ties of those attempting to fund  and task activists and local institutions such as hackerspaces and  DIYbio labs, to do the bidding of the establishment.  </p>
<p>Most importantly, the people of the West must learn from Asia the value  of collectively dismissing and circumventing unwarranted, unjust,  unnecessary, stifling legislation designed solely to protect special  interests.</p>
<p>Collective dismissal of legislation lobbied for by special interests  does indeed work, and sets an important precedent needed to check the  otherwise unimpeded incestuous relationship between big-business and  government.  This can be done not only through directly dismissing  legislation, but by constructing creative “loopholes” to circumvent such  legislation. In other cases, such as SOPA, PIPA, ACTA, and CISPA,  people can begin <a href="http://localorg.blogspot.com/2012/12/decentralizing-telecom.html">developing decentralized alternatives</a> that render moot entirely, attempts by the establishment to monopolize the people’s infrastructure. </p>
<p>3D printing and other disruptive forms of technology are taking off, and  as they work their way into an already dynamic Asian economy, the  West’s tech community stands to gain immeasurably by understanding and  collaborating with those in Asia that reflect their ideals. Ensuring the  success of disruptive technology in Asia will lead to millions of  people there who will in turn understand and support the West’s tech  community in their fight against legislation like SOPA, ACTA, and CISPA.  </p>
<p>Asia provides a model of merging old ideas, culture, and tradition with  cutting edge technology, opening the door to a future where economics  are local, but with global collaboration and awareness – a future where  the crippling unwise interdependency demanded by globalization is shed  off in exchange for decentralized independence granted by leveraging  technology to empower individuals and communities. It is a future that  is possible in Asia, and it is a future possible across the West – but  one that requires wider awareness and daily activism beyond merely  protesting to achieve.</p>

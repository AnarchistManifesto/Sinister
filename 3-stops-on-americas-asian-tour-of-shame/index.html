<p><i>America’s new Asian allies:  Dictator-for-life Hun Sen of Cambodia, Myanmar’s Aung San Suu Kyi and  her genocidal “Saffron monks,” and the despotic hereditary Shinawatra  regime of Thailand. </i></p>
<p>Tony Cartalucci, <i>Contributor</i><br />
<a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2012/11/3-stops-on-americas-asian-tour-of-shame.html"><b>Activist Post</b></a></p>
<p><b></b>US President Barack Obama is  embarking on what the Western media is calling a “historic trip.” In  reality he is coddling dictators and human rights abusers of the highest  caliber, even while waging proxy-war against Syria based on alleged  “human rights” concerns.</p>
<p><b>1. Thailand</b>: President Obama and US Secretary Hillary Clinton  first arrived in Bangkok, Thailand in efforts to legitimize and prop up  politically, Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, sister of deposed  despot Thaksin Shinawatra, who is using her to run the country by proxy  as he evades a 2 year jail sentence and 2 arrest warrants.</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both;text-align: center"><a href="https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/ThailandWarOnDrugs3.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em;margin-right: 1em"><img border="0" height="210" src="https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/ThailandWarOnDrugs2.jpg" width="400"></a></div>
<p>
<i><b>Image</b>: “The Thai Gov’ts War on Drugs: Dead Wrong. Stop the  Murder of Thai Drug Users.” During Thaksin Shinawatra’s 2003 “War on  Drugs” it wasn’t only drug users who were brutally, extra-judicially  murdered in the streets, but over 50% of the 2,800 killed during the  course of 3 months, were completely innocent, involved in no way with  either drug use or trade. This atrocity has been overlooked as he and  now his sister, Yingluck Shinawatra have proven their utility to  advancing the interests of Wall Street and London. </i></p>
<p><a name="more"></a>Despite mass-murdering nearly 3,000 people extra-legally over the course  of a 90-day 2003 “War on Drugs,” victims who most of which were later  found out to have had nothing to do with the drug trade at all, Thaksin  would also <a href="http://www.nationmultimedia.com/home/THAKSIN-VOWS-Troops-will-stay-in-Iraq-91151.html">send Thai troops to Iraq</a> in support of the US invasion and occupation, allow the US to use Thailand <a href="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/JA25Ae01.html">as a base for CIA rendition sites</a>, and attempted to push through a <a href="http://landdestroyer.blogspot.com/2011/02/flash-back-thailands-thaksin-and-us-fta.html">US-Thai free trade agreement</a> without parliamentary approval. Before becoming PM in 2001, <a href="http://thanong.tripod.com/03072001.htm">he had served as an adviser</a> for the notorious US equity firm, the Carlyle Group.</p>

He would be ousted from power in 2006 by a military coup, and has since then been supported by some of the <a href="http://altthainews.blogspot.com/2012/11/thailand-thaksin-shinawatras-foreign.html">largest Western lobbying firms on Earth</a> including, <a href="http://2bangkok.com/07-news07apr.html">Kenneth Adelman</a> of the <a href="http://www.fara.gov/docs/3634-Exhibit-AB-20070125-4.pdf">Edelman PR firm</a> (<a href="http://www.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?boardmember=4&amp;page=10">Freedom House</a>, <a href="http://www.crisisgroup.org/en/about/board/kenneth-adelman.aspx">International Crisis Group</a>, <a href="http://www.newamericancentury.org/Bushletter-040302.htm">PNAC</a>), James Baker of <a href="http://disclosures.house.gov/ld/pdfform.aspx?id=200059128">Baker Botts</a> (<a href="http://www.cfr.org/about/membership/roster.html?letter=B">CFR</a>), <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/29/washington/29blackwill.html?_r=3&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;oref=login&amp;pagewanted=print&amp;adxnnlx=1194092186-oD/P7hK9sBgiXh7U96GOBA">Robert Blackwill</a> of <a href="http://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=getFilingDetails&amp;filingID=1AA1A98A-2494-44E5-A5CB-F658EB445C4B">Barbour Griffith &amp; Rogers</a> (<a href="http://www.cfr.org/about/membership/roster.html?letter=B">CFR</a>), <a href="http://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=getFilingDetails&amp;filingID=4064D36C-F215-480C-8F07-B383B45BEE09">Kobre &amp; Kim</a>, and currently <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/?p=21259">Robert Amsterdam</a> of <a href="http://disclosures.house.gov/ld/pdfform.aspx?id=300322917">Amsterdam &amp; Peroff</a> (<a href="http://www.chathamhouse.org/membership/corporate/corporate-list">Chatham House</a>).</p>
<p>Robert Amsterdam of Amsterdam &amp; Peroff, would also simultaneously  represent Thaksin’s “red shirt” street movement, and was present for the  inaugural meeting of the  <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/?p=14333">so-called “academic” Nitirat group</a>,  attended mostly by pro-Thaksin red shirts (who literally wore their red  shirts to the meeting). Additional support for Thaksin and his UDD  street-front is provided by the US State Department via National  Endowment for Democracy-funded “NGO” <a href="http://altthainews.blogspot.com/2011/08/exposed-indy-funded-by-us-government.html">Prachatai</a>.”</p>
<p>His atrocities and autocratic style of leadership were overlooked  because of the immense utility he served for US interests – a utility  the US still hopes he and his proxy sister can continue to serve. </p>
<p><b>2. Myanmar</b>: While the media focuses on the “repressive military  junta,” the real human rights abusers happen to also be long-time US  allies in the region. Specifically, they are the “Saffron monks” who had  took to the streets in so-called “pro-democracy” rallies on behalf of  Western-hailed “democracy icon” Aung San Suu Kyi.</p>

While Associated Press claims  these protesters are demonstrating against ethnic violence, the sign  they carry clearly states that they seek the expulsion of the refugees  from Myanmar, and are merely protesting against the Myanmar Army’s use  of force to protect refugees from the “monks&#8217;” attacks that have left scores dead and  thousands of refugee homes destroyed. </i></p>
<p>In reality, Suu Kyi’s movement is yet another Wall Street-London funded creation, and <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/?p=10822">the rank and file of her movement are sectarian extremists</a> who seek to eradicate through exile or genocidal extermination the Rohingya refugees located in Myanmar’s Rakhine state.</p>
<p>In “<a href="https://www.activistpost.com/?p=15335">Myanmar (Burma) “Pro-Democracy” Movement a Creation of Wall Street &amp; London</a>,”  it was documented that Suu Kyi and organizations supporting her,  including local propaganda fronts like the New Era Journal, the  Irrawaddy, and the Democratic Voice of Burma (DVB) radio, have received  millions of dollars a year from the <a href="http://landdestroyer.blogspot.com/2011/11/ned-freedom-house-are-run-by.html">Neo-Conservative chaired</a> National Endowment for Democracy, <a href="http://landdestroyer.blogspot.com/2012/03/surpise-soros-is-convicted-criminal.html">convicted criminal</a> and Wall Street speculator George Soros’ Open Society Institute, and the US State Department itself, citing Britain’s own “<a href="http://burmacampaign.org.uk/images/uploads/DFIDReview.pdf">Burma Campaign UK (.pdf)</a>.” </p>
<p>The goal of Western meddling in Myanmar, still called by its British  imperial nomenclature of “Burma” by many across the Western media, is to  balk Chinese investments across the country, while establishing yet  another permanently failed, 3rd world state that can be fully exploited  and stripped bare by the Fortune 500 and intense “free trade.”</p>
<p><b>3. Cambodia:</b> Perhaps the most hypocritical and absurd stop on  President Obama’s trip will be his visit to Cambodia, ruled for the past  27 years by dictator-for-life Hun Sen. Formerly of the genocidal Khmer  Rouge, Hun Sen has spent his time in office stripping bare his own  people, and just recently, has allowed foreigners to part-take in the  dismemberment of his own nation.</p>
<p>While running under the illusion of “people’s power,” he has since 2008  sold over half of his nation off to foreign investors, right out from  under the Cambodian people.</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both;text-align: center"><a href="https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Cambodia_Land_Grab1.png" style="margin-left: 1em;margin-right: 1em"><img border="0" height="276" src="https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Cambodia_Land_Grab.png" width="400"></a></div>
<p><i><b>Image</b>: While the West funds and arms verified Al Qaeda  militants invading Syria for alleged “humanitarian concerns,” tacit  approval is granted to governments like that of Hun Sen of Cambodia to  brutalize his own population in sweeping land grabs that have left  hundreds of thousands of Cambodian people without homes or a livelihood.  The difference? Syria refuses to capitulate to Wall Street and London’s  “international order,” Cambodia is eagerly selling off its sovereignty  to it. </i></p>
<p>In a 2008 article by the Guardian titled, “<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/apr/26/cambodia">Country for Sale</a>,”  it was reported that, “almost half of Cambodia has been sold to foreign  speculators in the past 18 months – and hundreds of thousands who fled  the Khmer Rouge are homeless once more.” The report would go on to  state:  </p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>Hun Sen and his ruling Cambodian People’s Party (CPP) have, in effect,  put the country up for sale. Crucially, they permit investors to form  100% foreign-owned companies in Cambodia that can buy land and real  estate outright – or at least on 99-year plus 99-year leases. No other  country in the world countenances such a deal. Even in Thailand and  Vietnam, where similar land speculation and profiteering are under way,  foreigners can be only minority shareholders. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It would continue: </p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>By March this year [2008], virtually all Cambodia’s  accessible and sandy coast was in private hands, either Cambodian or  foreign. Those who lived or worked there were turfed out – some jailed,  others beaten, virtually all denied meaningful compensation.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The article would also state:  </p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>It was abundantly clear to observers, including the World Bank and  Amnesty International, that by making these private deals, Hun Sen was  denying prosperity to most of his people, causing the country’s social  fabric to unwind like thread from a bobbin. Today, more than 150,000  people are threatened with eviction. Forty-five per cent of the  country’s entire landmass has been sold off – from the land ringing  Angkor Wat to the colonial buildings of Phnom Penh to the south-western  islands. Professor Yash Ghai, the UN human rights emissary to Cambodia,  warned, ‘One does not need expertise in human rights to recognise that  many policies of the government have… deprived people of their  economic resources and means of livelihood, and denied them their  dignity.’ He added, ‘I believe that the deliberate rejection of the  concept of a state governed by the rule of law has been central to the  ruling party’s hold on power.’</p>

<p>Since the 2008 Guardian article, the situation has only deteriorated for  the Cambodian people. The Guardian again reported in September 2012 in  their article, “<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/sep/25/conflict-over-land-cambodia">Conflict over land in Cambodia is taking a dangerous turn</a>,” that:</p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

If evictees don’t go peacefully,  private firms are willing and able to tap the resources of the state to  forcefully capture land. </p>

<p>Yet despite Hun Sen’s government brutalizing its own people with  harassment, violence, and murder, displacing hundreds of thousands of  civilians, and stealing the land right out from under the nation’s poor, US President Barack Obama <a href="http://bangkokpost.com/news/local/320470/obama-prepares-to-make-historic-trip-to-myanmar">intends to visit Cambodia to meet with Prime Minister Hun Sen</a>.  There has been no protest or formal condemnation by the US regarding  Hun Sen and his systematic campaign of theft and violence waged against  the Cambodian people, nor has there been any protests of political  ramifications imposed by the emerging supranational block ASEAN who is  in fact holding their annual meeting in  Phnom Penh, Cambodia this  month.</p>
<p>It also turns out that the very military units snatching land from  hundreds of thousands of impoverished Cambodians are actually receiving  US military aid and training. Indeed, <a href="http://www.army.mil/-news/2010/07/21/42598-soldiers-jump-into-history-with-cambodians-during-angkor-sentinel-2010/">Operation Angkor Sentinel</a> kicked off in July 2010 as US Army troops trained with the local Cambodian troops. The United States <a href="http://cambodia.usembassy.gov/sp_071810.html">shamelessly defends</a> the exercises claiming that “Our  military relationship is about … working toward effective defence  reform, toward encouraging the kind of civil-military relationship that  is essential to any healthy political system,” according to William Burns, then US undersecretary of state for political affairs.</p>
<p><b>Why the Hypocrisy? </b></p>
<p>The Washington Post, in their recent article, “<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/president-obama-defends-historic-trip-to-burma/2012/11/18/ad2bbb98-319f-11e2-bfd5-e202b6d7b501_story.html">President Obama defends historic trip to Burma</a>,” claims:</p>

<p>For over two decades the United States has expressed throughout a  library of policy papers the need to develop and implement an effective  “containment” strategy versus China. In 1997, US policy author Robert  Kagan of the American Enterprise Institute and the Brookings Institution  penned, “<a href="http://carnegieendowment.org/publications/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=266&amp;solr_hilite=Thailand">What China Knows That We Don’t: The Case for a New Strategy of Containment</a>,” where he  literally states (emphasis added):  </p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p><b>The present world order serves the needs of the United States and its  allies, which constructed it.</b> And it is poorly suited to the needs of a  Chinese dictatorship trying to maintain power at home and increase its  clout abroad. Chinese leaders chafe at the constraints on them and worry  that they must change the rules of the international system before the  international system changes them. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/ultimatesurvivalplan.html" style="float: right;margin-left: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em" target="_blank"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-CTsdDqKcvhI/T7GjToaksaI/AAAAAAAAO2s/8vEb9HmqOhk/s316/160x316.gif" alt=""></a>He would continue by saying: </p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>The changes in the external and internal behavior of the  Soviet Union in the late 1980s resulted at least in part from an  <b>American strategy that might be called ‘integration through containment  and pressure for change.’ </b></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p><b>Such a strategy needs to be applied to China today</b>. As  long as China maintains its present form of government, it cannot be  peacefully integrated into the international order. For China’s current  leaders, it is too risky to play by our rules — yet our unwillingness  to force them to play by our rules is too risky for the health of the  international order. The United States cannot and should not be willing  to upset the international order in the mistaken belief that  accommodation is the best way to avoid a confrontation with China. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p><b>We should hold the line instead and work for political  change in Beijing.</b> That means strengthening our military capabilities in  the region,<b> improving our security ties with friends and allies, and  making clear that we will respond, with force if necessary, when China  uses military intimidation or aggression to achieve its regional  ambitions.</b> It also means not trading with the Chinese military or doing  business with firms the military owns or operates. And it means imposing  stiff sanctions when we catch China engaging in nuclear proliferation. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<div align="left">A successful containment strategy will require  increasing, not decreasing, our overall defense capabilities. Eyre Crowe  warned in 1907 that ‘the more we talk of the necessity of economising  on our armaments, the more firmly will the Germans believe that we are  tiring of the struggle, and that they will win by going on.’ <b>Today, the  perception of our military decline is already shaping Chinese  calculations</b>. In 1992, an internal Chinese government document said that  America’s “strength is in relative decline and that there are limits to  what it can do.’ <b>This perception needs to be dispelled as quickly as  possible.</b>

<i><b>Image</b>: Figure 1. From SSI’s <a href="http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pubs/display.cfm?pubid=721">2006 “String of Pearls” report</a>   detailing a strategy of containment for China. While “democracy,”   “freedom,” and “human rights” will mask the ascension of Western aligned  client regimes into power, it is part of a region-wide campaign to  overthrow   nationalist elements and install client regimes in order <a href="http://landdestroyer.blogspot.com/2011/03/target-china.html">to encircle and contain China</a>.  Violence in areas like Sittwe, Rakhine Myanmar, or Gwadar Baluchistan  Pakistan, are not coincidences and documented evidence indicates immense  Western backing for armed opposition groups. </i>  </p>
<p>This would be further expanded on in the Strategic Studies Institute’s <a href="http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pubs/display.cfm?pubid=721">2006 “String of Pearls” report</a> where specific areas of Chinese expansion were identified for disruption and containment. This included the now <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/?p=13453">destabilized Baluchistan region in Pakistan</a> where China’s Gwadar port sits, as well as the <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/?p=10822">destabilized state of Rakhine in Myanmar</a>.</p>
<p>US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton would reiterate this commitment to  containing China, as well as touch upon another point made by Kagan in  1997 – that Southeast Asian nations would need to be aligned with the US  against China as part of any viable containment strategy – in her 2011  op-ed in Foreign Policy titled, “<a href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/10/11/americas_pacific_century?page=full">The American Pacific Century</a>.”</p>
<p>Leading a Thailand, Myanmar, or Cambodia, fully complicit with the  United States and its  neo-imperial ambition to sustain another century of American hegemony  across Asia is a role despots, proxies, and human rights violators like  Thaksin Shinawatra, his sister Yingluck, Aung San Suu Kyi, and Hun Sen  were cultivated for decades to  fulfill, and it is precisely for this reason that so much money, time,  and effort has been poured into both propping them up, including with  this latest legitimacy-lending exercise by President Obama, while  tearing down existing regional indigenous institutions through color  revolutions and “NGO-creep.”</p>

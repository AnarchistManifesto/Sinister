<a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2014/03/10-scientific-studies-that-prove.html"><b>Activist Post</b></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2012/01/10-inventions-of-nikola-tesla-that.html">Nikola Tesla</a> said it best, “the day  science begins to study non-physical phenomena, it will make more  progress in one decade than in all the previous centuries of its  existence. To understand the true nature of the universe, one must think  it terms of energy, frequency and vibration.” Swami Vivekananda was Tesla’s mentor, an Indian Hindu monk and chief disciple of the 19th century saint Ramakrishna.</p>
<p>Science works best when in harmony with  nature. If we put these two together, we can discover great technologies  that can only come about when the consciousness of the planet is ready  to embrace them, like<a href="http://www.collective-evolution.com/?s=free+energy" target="_blank"> free energy</a>.</p>
<p>I want to make it clear that my  intention of presenting this information is to demonstrate that  thoughts, intentions, prayer and other units of consciousness can  directly influence our physical material world. Consciousness can be a  big factor in creating change on the planet.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>Sending thoughts of love,  healing intent, prayer, good intention, and more can have a powerful  influence on what you are directing those feelings towards. Fukushima  for example, if a mass amount of people send their thoughts and good  intention to our waters, we can help mitigate the situation. These  concepts can be used on a mass scale as one human race with one intent  in their hearts, for multiple problems, as well as individual situations  in our own lives. When our consciousness starts to merge into one as a  collective, and we all start to see through the same eyes, we will begin  to transform the world around us. I believe we are currently in this  process. </p>
<p>For quite  some time now, physicists have been exploring the relationship between   human consciousness and its relationship to the structure of matter. Previously  it was believed that a Newtonian material universe was the foundation  of our physical material reality. This all changed when scientists began  to recognize that everything in the universe is made out of energy.  Quantum physicists discovered that physical atoms are made up of  vorticies of energy that are constantly spinning and vibrating. Matter,  at its tiniest observable level, is energy, and human consciousness is  connected to it, human consciousness can influence it’s behavior and  even re-structure it.</p>

Everything we call real is made of things that cannot be regarded as real. – Niels Bohr </p>

<p>
The hypothesis of modern science starts from matter as the basic reality, considering space to be an extension of the void. The phenomenon of creation of stable cosmic matter, therefore, goes beyond the scope of present science. The theory also neither pinpoints the source of cosmic energy that resides in the structure of matter, nor can it explain the cause of material properties that are experienced with the behavior of matter.  These are, in brief, the limitations of modern scientific theories at the most basic level of the physical phenomena of nature. When a scientific theory cannot cope with the question of the very origin of the universal matter and energy, how could it ever grasp and explain the phenomenon of consciousness which is evident in living beings? – Paramahamsa Tewari <a href="http://www.tewari.org/Books/SpititualFoundations/SF%20R12702.htm">(0)</a></p>

<p>The revelation that the universe is not an assembly of physical parts, but instead comes from an entanglement of immaterial energy waves stems from the work of Albert Einstein, Max Planck and Werner Heisenberg, amongst others.</p>
<p><b>1. The Quantum Double Slit Experiment   </b></p>
<p>The quantum double-slit experiment is a great example of how consciousness and our physical material world are intertwined. One potential revelation of this experience is that “the observer creates the reality.” A paper published in the peer-reviewed journal <i>Physics Essays</i> explains how this experiment has been used multiple times to explore the role of consciousness in shaping the nature of physical reality. <a href="http://media.noetic.org/uploads/files/PhysicsEssays-Radin-DoubleSlit-2012.pdf">(2)</a></p>
<p>In this experiment, a double-slit optical system was used to test the possible role of consciousness  in the collapse of the quantum wave-function. The ratio of the interference pattern’s double-slit spectral power to its single-slit spectral power was predicted to decrease when attention was focused toward the double slit as compared to away from it. The study found that factors associated with consciousness <b>significantly </b>correlated in predicted ways with perturbations in the double-slit interference pattern.<a href="http://media.noetic.org/uploads/files/PhysicsEssays-Radin-DoubleSlit-2012.pdf">(2)</a> For visual demonstration of this experiment, click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfPeprQ7oGc">here</a>.</p>

Observation not only disturbs what  has to be measured, they produce it. We compel the electron to assume a  definite position. We ourselves produce the results of the measurement. <a href="http://media.noetic.org/uploads/files/PhysicsEssays-Radin-DoubleSlit-2012.pdf" target="_blank">(2)</a> </p>
<p>A fundamental conclusion of the new  physics also acknowledges that the observer creates the reality. As  observers, we are personally involved with the creation of our own  reality. Physicists are being forced to admit that the universe is a  “mental” construction. Pioneering physicist Sir James Jeans wrote: “The  stream of knowledge is heading toward a non-mechanical reality; the  universe begins to look more like a great thought than like a great  machine. Mind no longer appears to be an accidental intruder into the  realm of matter, we ought rather hail it as the creator and governor of  the realm of matter. Get over it, and accept the inarguable conclusion.  The universe is immaterial-mental and spiritual. (R.C. Henry, “The Mental Universe” ; Nature 436:29,2005) <a href="http://henry.pha.jhu.edu/The.mental.Universe.pdf">(1)</a></p>

<p>In 2004, a United States Air Force research project declassified a paper titled <i>Teleportation Physics Study</i>,  authored by Eric Davis, Ph. D., showing that psychokinesis and other  parapsychological phenomenon have been subject to rigorous research and  documentation by several researchers and institutions. <a href="http://www.fas.org/sgp/eprint/teleport.pdf">(4)</a> </p>
<p>One particular example was the work of  professional aerospace engineer Jack Houck, along with Army Colonel J.B.  Alexander. They were responsible for holding a number of PK sessions,  where attendees were taught the PK induction process and how to initiate  their own PK events using various metal specimens like forks and  spoons. Individuals were able to completely bend or contort their metal  specimens with no physical force being applied whatsoever. <a href="http://www.jackhouck.com/pdf_files/pk_materials_format.pdf" target="_blank">(5)</a></p>
<p>These events were held for government  science advisers and senior military officials. They took place at the  Pentagon, at officers’ and scientists’ homes, and at U.S Army  Intelligence &amp; Security Command locations all over the world.  Commanding generals, colonels and more were always in attendance. What  was witnessed by all was spontaneous deformation of mental  specimens,  which caused “a great deal of excitement” amongst those present. <a href="http://www.fas.org/sgp/eprint/teleport.pdf" target="_blank">(4)</a></p>

<p>RNGs are systems created by Princeton researchers that are sensitive to and respond to the intentions of individuals, in other words, the influence of consciousness. They also respond to marked shifts in attention occurring in their environment. Peaks of order are commonly recorded during moments of shared attention and emotions. RNGs also responded, and had the largest effects ever recorded by the Global Consciousness Project during major world events, like 9/11. <a href="http://boundarytech.com/bi/articles/FoPL_nelson-pp.pdf">(6) </a>Other large recordings have occurred on presidential inaugurations, tsunamis and the deaths of public figures. These findings stirred deep questions about the nature of consciousness and its connection to our physical material reality.</p>

<p><b>4. NSA/CIA Remote Viewing Experiments In Conjunction With Stanford University</b></p>
<p>Remote viewing is the ability of  individuals to describe remote geographical locations up to several  hundred thousand kilometers (even more) away. This concept has been  proven, demonstrated and documented a number of times.</p>
<p>In 1995, the CIA declassified and  approved the release of documents revealing its involvement in the  program that lasted for more than 25 years. <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/%7Epear/pdfs/1979-precognitive-remote-viewing-stanford.pdf" target="_blank">(10)</a> <a href="http://www.scientificexploration.org/journal/jse_10_1_puthoff.pdf" target="_blank">(9)</a></p>
<p>Ingo Swann, one participant in this  experiment was able to view specific rings around Jupiter before NASA  was about to take pictures of it with their pioneer 10 craft. This was  documented in the research. Individuals were also able to view objects  and people in separate rooms that were completely blocked off from their  present physical location. The fact that some have/had the capability  to project their consciousness elsewhere from their present physical  location is quite amazing.</p>
<p>These projects occurred for decades,  while some of the mainstream world continued to view them as  “pseudoscience,” the Department of Defense takes them extremely  seriously, and keeps them extremely secret. This program was part of a  program called “STARGATE” and was unexpectedly shut down. <a href="http://www.lfr.org/lfr/csl/media/air_mayresponse.html" target="_blank">(11)</a></p>

<p><b>5. Thoughts and Intentions Alter The Physical Structure of Water</b></p>
<p>Experiments over the past four decades have investigated whether human intention alone affects the properties of water. <a href="http://media.noetic.org/uploads/files/Double-blind_water.pdf" target="_blank">(12)</a></p>
<p>This question has been around for a  while in the alternative medicine realms, because the human body is made  up of approximately 70% water. According to the Institute of Noetic  Sciences, researchers have suggested that intentionally influenced water  can be detected by examining ice crystals formed from samples of that  water. Consistent results commonly point to the idea that positive  intentions tend to produce symmetric, well-formed, aesthetically  pleasing crystals, and negative intentions tend to produce asymmetric,  poorly formed and unattractive crystals. <a href="http://media.noetic.org/uploads/files/Double-blind_water.pdf" target="_blank">(12)</a></p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/brainpower.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-8ssvZnyZcbU/UCU592GDFdI/AAAAAAAARU8/SrY8brpj-r0/s200/200x200.jpg"></a>If thoughts and emotions can do this to water, just imagine what they can do to us.</p>
<p>Many people point out that this  experiment was a fraud, but it’s been conducted multiple times and  replicated by some highly respectable individuals in the field of  science. The paper I am citing here is from Dean Radin, who has  published multiple research papers in peer-reviewed journals. The  experiment was conducted at the Institute for Noetic Sciences and  Adjunct Faculty in the Department of Psychology at Sonoma State  University. <a href="http://media.noetic.org/uploads/files/Double-blind_water.pdf" target="_blank">(12) </a></p>
<p>You can read more about this experiment <a href="http://www.collective-evolution.com/2013/12/01/if-thoughts-can-do-this-to-water-imagine-what-they-can-do-to-us/" target="_blank">here</a></p>
<p>This also correlates with a study that  examined the role of intention and belief on mood while drinking tea. It  explored whether drinking tea “treated” with good intentions by monks  would have an effect on mood more so than drinking ordinary tea. The  study was done under double-blind, randomized conditions, and results  proved positive. <a href="http://deanradin.com/evidence/Shiah2013.pdf" target="_blank">(13)</a></p>
<p><b>6. The Placebo Effect</b></p>
<p>It’s been well documented that we can  change our biology simply by what we believe to be true. The placebo  effect is defined as the measurable, observable, or felt improvement in  health or behavior not attributable to a medication or invasive  treatment that has been administered. It suggests that one can treat  various ailments by using the mind to heal. Many studies have shown that  the placebo effect (the power of consciousness) is real and highly  effective.</p>
<p>A Baylor School of Medicine study, published in 2002 in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine, <b><a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa013259">(1)</a></b></i><b> </b>looked  at surgery for patients with severe and debilitating knee pain. Many  surgeons know there is no placebo effect in surgery, or so most of them  believe. The patients were divided into three groups. The surgeons  shaved the damaged cartilage in the knee of one group. For the second  group they flushed out the knee joint, removing all of the material  believed to be causing inflammation. Both of these processes are the  standard surgeries people go through who have severe arthritic knees.  The third group received a “fake” surgery, the patients were only  sedated and tricked that they actually had the knee surgery. For the  patients not really receiving the surgery, the doctors made the  incisions and splashed salt water on the knee as they would in normal  surgery. They then sewed up the incisions like the real thing and the  process was complete. All three groups went through the same rehab  process, and the results were astonishing. The placebo group improved  just as much as the other two groups who had surgery.</p>

<p>Another great example of the placebo  effect came from the United States Department of Health and Human  Services in 1999. The report discovered that half of severely depressed  patients taking drugs improve compared to the thirty-two percent taking a  placebo. Don’t forget about all of the side effects and dangers that  have been associated with antidepressants every year. Don’t forget that  the ‘depression industry’ alone is a multi-billion dollar one.</p>
<p>A 2002 article published in the American Psychological Association’s <i>prevention &amp; treatment, </i>by  University of Connecticut psychology professor Irving Kirsch titled,  “The Emperor’s New Drugs,” made some more shocking discoveries<a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/?&amp;fa=main.doiLanding&amp;doi=10.1037/1522-3736.5.1.523a" target="_blank">(15)</a><a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/mind-reviews-the-emperors-new-drugs/">(16).</a>  He found that 80 percent of the effect of antidepressants, as measured  in clinical trials, could be attributed to the placebo effect. This  professor even had to file a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request  to get information on the clinical trials of the top antidepressants.</p>

<p><b>7. Teleportation</b></p>
<p>“It became known to myself,  along with several colleagues both inside and outside of government,  that anomalous teleportation has been scientifically investigated and  separately documented by the Department of Defense.”</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/miracle-mind.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-qowGSTw02Pw/T2NvLdG4KVI/AAAAAAAAOrA/oAUJFUFAexw/s252/160x252.jpg"></a>A paper published in the Peoples Republic of China (PRC) in September 1981, in the journal <i>Ziran Zazhi (Nature Journal)</i>tilted <i>“Some Experiments on the Transfer of Objects Performed by Unusual Abilities of the Human Body”</i> (Shuhuang  et al., 1981) reported that ‘gifted children,’ were able to cause the  teleportation of small, physical objects from one place to another.<a href="http://www.fas.org/sgp/eprint/teleport.pdf">(4)</a> Objects  included watches, horseflies, other insects, radio micro-transmitters,  photosensitive paper and more. The participants never touched the  objects beforehand. The experiments were done under both blind and  double-blind conditions, and the researches involved came from various  colleges and sectors of the Department of Defense. This is an  exceptional case, because it was deemed necessary that an unclassified  Intelligence Information Report be prepared for public viewing.</p>
<p>More research was done by the Aerospace Medicine Engineering  Institute in Beijing, in July of 1990. It was published in the Chinese  Journal of <i>Somatic Science</i> (Kongzhi et al., 1990: Jinggen et  al., 1990; Banghui; 1990). This study reported several experiments  involving high-speed photography video taping, which was able to capture  the transfer of test specimens like nuts, matches, nails, pills and  more through the walls of sealed paper envelopes, sealed glass bottles  and tubes, sealed plastic film canisters and more without the walls of  any of these containers being breached.  All of these experiments  reported using gifted children and adults to cause the teleportation of  various materials. <a href="http://www.fas.org/sgp/eprint/teleport.pdf">(4)</a></p>

<p><b>8. The Science of The Heart</b></p>
<p>The heart generates the largest  electromagnetic field produced in the body. Researchers have analyzed  the spectrum analysis of the magnetic field that’s produced by the  heart, and results have shown that emotional information is encoded into  this electromagnetic field. So, by shifting our emotions, we are  changing the information that is encoded into these electromagnetic  field that are radiated by the heart. This can impact those around us.  When we are feeling emotions of compassion, love, gratitude and  understanding, the heart beats out a very different message.</p>

<p><b>9/10 And Beyond</b></p>
<p>There are numerous  studies documenting how consciousness and our physical material reality  are intertwined, in so many different ways, with many different examples  like the ones listed above. I am going to leave you with a long list of  selected peer-reviewed journal publications on Psi research. This  involves anomalous processes of information or energy transfer,  telepathy and other forms of unexplained phenomenon that have  observable, repeatable outcomes in the lab.</p>
<p>Click <a href="http://noetic.org/research/psi-research/" target="_blank">HERE</a> to continue your research on how consciousness and our physical material world are interconnected.</p>
<p>Consciousness plays a very important  role in changing our planet. Just having these thoughts alone would  contribute to the massive shift in consciousness that’s occurring. Find  your inner peace, be peace, be love, acting and living your life from  such a place plays a very important role in changing the world.</p>

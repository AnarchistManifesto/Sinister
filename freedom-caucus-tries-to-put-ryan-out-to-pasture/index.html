<p><b><i> </i>FREEDOM CAUCUS TRIES TO PUT RYAN OUT TO PASTURE<br /> </b>Springtime has been soggy in the east this year, but in much of farm country it has been too dry. The Texas panhandle, Oklahoma, Kansas, and other parts of the interior are in a bad way.</p>

<p> Industry experts estimate that about a third of the nation’s cow herd lives in a drought-stricken state. The worry now is that we will see a repeat of 2011 when summer thunderstorms failed to break up the pattern, leaving cattlemen, farmers, and consumers feeling the pinch.</p>
<p> But if you are a politician not from one of those states, you might not care so much. And if what you really wanted to do was get yourself booked on television so that you could run for House speaker or a higher office for your home state, those parched shorthorns wouldn’t mean much to you at all.</p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p> The big news in Washington today was that members of the House Freedom Caucus united to <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/05/17/gop-fights-over-crucial-farm-bill-as-lawmakers-demand-immigration-vote-first.html">defeat</a> a farm bill, backed by soon-to-be-former House Speaker <b>Paul Ryan</b>. It’s not that caucus members oppose the legislation itself. In fact, the reason they were able to kill the bill was that it had been made in their likeness.</p>
<div class="ad-container mobile">
<div class="ad gpt ad-h-250"></div>
</p></div>
<p> Agriculture legislation in the United States has to do with a lot more than soybeans. One of America’s principle welfare benefits, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistant Program, is a $70 billion behemoth that supplies more than 1 in 10 Americans with food. We call them “food stamps,” but by any name they are a key component of U.S. domestic policy.</p>
<p> Ryan wants to finish out his term as Speaker having said that he had done <i>something</i> about welfare reform. Frustrated by his own party in his efforts to make changes to underfunded entitlement programs, Ryan’s last shot to do something about big-ticket domestic spending is probably food stamps.</p>
<p> Populist Republicans like those in the Freedom Caucus and <b>President Trump </b>initially grumbled that Ryan wasn’t being tough enough on food stamp recipients, but seemed to accept that his administrative reforms were enough. They certainly were enough to lose every Democratic vote on what was traditionally bipartisan legislation.</p>
<p> The reason the farmers aren’t getting a new farm bill, though doesn’t have anything to do with farming or food, this is about breaking the Republican establishment’s back.</p>
<p> Freedom Caucus members said that they would not vote for the legislation unless Ryan brought forward their preferred bill on dealing with young adults who were brought to the United States illegally as minors. Their <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2018/05/17/ryan-mccarthy-immigration-dreamers-clash-597381" target="_blank">bill</a> on the “DREAMers” probably could not pass the House and definitely could not pass the Senate. By forcing the vote, though, Freedom Caucus members hope to punish their fellow Republicans who take more moderate positions about those in the United States illegally.</p>
<p> These are votes that could be used against moderate Republicans in primaries or elections for other offices. The Freedom Caucus came up short in a bid to win a House primary in Ohio last week, but they’ll be back. This is how the 31-member group is trying to hold up the other 206 Republicans in the House.</p>
<p> Part of the problem here is Ryan’s decision to announce his departure but try to serve out the year. The Freedom Caucus and its leaders have plenty of time to extract desperate promises from Ryan’s designated successor, Majority Leader <b>Kevin</b> <b>McCarthy</b> Failing that, they will <a href="https://www.axios.com/ebola-outbreak-reaches-congo-city-mbandaka-0a1494e0-241e-41c2-8808-b4b1bb254106.html" target="_blank">attempt to</a> install one of their own, Rep. <b>Jim</b> <b>Jordan</b>, R-Ohio, in his place.</p>
<p> Making this potboiler even more dramatic is that the other recent aim of the Freedom Caucus, impeding and discrediting the investigation into misconduct by members of Trump’s 2016 campaign apparatus, is heating up at the same time.</p>
<p> House Intelligence Committee Chairman <b>Devin</b> <b>Nunes</b> is doing his best to give Trump a reason to force out Deputy Attorney General <b>Rod</b> <b>Rosenstein</b>. Nunes and the rest of Trump’s team in the House have been pushing Rosenstein to disclose what he says is sensitive information that could damage this case and potentially others if exposed.</p>
<p> Without offering any evidence, Nunes said on “Fox &amp; Friends” this morning that federal agents may have “set up” members of Trump’s campaign team. The suggestion that federal agents were trying to entrap the members of a political campaign into criminal wrongdoing is, needless to say, a very serious one. But then, making such an accusation without evidence would be very serious stuff, too.</p>
<p> But whether or not there was a “spy” doesn’t matter for the purposes of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/bigger-than-watergate-trump-joins-push-by-allies-to-expose-an-fbi-source/2018/05/17/db211542-59ea-11e8-8836-a4a123c359ab_story.html?utm_term=.d48cfc9c3942" target="_blank">what Nunes is doing right now</a>. Rosenstein has been playing along with Nunes’ demands up to the point that other, less determined intercessors for the president have been satisfied that no wrongdoing has occurred. But at some point, Rosenstein will flatly refuse Nunes, which could be just the pretext Trump would need to order Rosenstein to comply.</p>
<p> Rosenstein would then be obliged to quit. That way, Trump and his legal team (both inside and outside of Congress) could say that the president’s just interested in transparency and accountability, not impeding the investigation that has so dogged his administration.</p>
<p> Nunes suggests that Trump staffers may have been entrapped into canoodling with Russian agents, but what he was doing to Rosenstein certainly looks like entrapment itself.</p>
<p> Ryan and McCarthy, with the help of Rep. <b>Trey</b> <b>Gowdy</b>, R-S.C., have been trying to keep Nunes on some kind of a tether for months. Nunes needs Gowdy because for some unstated reason the intelligence committee chairman does not read the intelligence reports in the case provided to him. Instead, Gowdy reads them and briefs Nunes. It’s all impossibly weird. But the strange arrangement may be coming to an end.</p>
<p> Freedom Caucus members have been applying maximum pressure against the Justice Department for months. But, this moment with a lame-duck speaker, a designated successor worried about flopping the way he did when he tried to replace <b>John</b> <b>Boehner</b> and anxieties all over the conference about a possible midterm rout makes for a season of rich opportunity.</p>
<p> The other 206 republicans do not want to end up the way Rep. <b>Robert</b> <b>Pittenger</b> R-N.C. did last week when he lost to a primary challenger who deemed ultra-conservative Pittenger to have insufficient MAGA zeal. As the president has shown with Nunes booster Rep. <b>Ron</b> <b>DeSantis</b>, R-Fla, in DeSantis’ bid for Florida governor, the president richly rewards those who are the most outspoken against the Justice Department.</p>
<p> The rest of the Republican conference has relied on the fact that Ryan and others could keep the investigation into the investigation from running afoul of decency and good standards, but few of them are likely to take a chance on appearing to be sympathetic to the “Deep State.”</p>
<p> The Farm Bill revolt doesn’t have anything to do with farmers. The intelligence committee has increasingly little to do with intelligence. And the legislative branch doesn’t seem to have much to do with legislation.</p>
<p> If you are a farmer waiting for help or certainty or a citizen hoping that we can find some way to maintain the rule of law while still holding powerful people to account, you will just have to wait until all of the ambitions of the member of the House are satisfied.</p>

It&#8217;s this saliva that&#8217;s responsible for the irritating itch of a mosquito bite, thanks to a concoction of proteins found in it that people are slightly allergic to. Now, a new study in mice suggests that your immune system could react to these allergy-inducing proteins for up to a week, potentially explaining why an itchy bite lingers so long. … By analyzing blood bone marrow, skin and spleen cells from the mice, the researchers found that a number of immune cells remained active even seven days after the mice were bitten. This was the ‘most interesting’ part of the study — ‘that the effects lasted that long,’ said senior study author <b>Rebecca Rico-Hesse</b>, a professor of virology at the Baylor College of Medicine.”</p>

The rule is similar to one in place during the Reagan administration. The proposal was drafted by the Health and Human Services Department and is currently under review by the White House budget office. The proposed regulation would apply to Title X, the federal program that provides at least $260 million annually for contraception, screenings for sexually transmitted diseases and other reproductive health services to millions of low-income people, according to the official, who asked not to be named. The rule change would put Planned Parenthood back in the crosshairs after repeated attempts by congressional Republicans to defund the family planning group, which provides abortions but says the federal money it receives does not go toward paying for the procedures.”</p>

<p> <b>FROM THE BLEACHERS<br /> </b>“Hello Chris (and Dana), When did ‘Appa-lay-cha’ become ‘Appa-lah-cha?’ I heard you both say the latter on the podcast this week, which would have been the first time I had heard it that way but for a coal-mining documentary currently on Netflix that I watched just a few days ago.  Is it like when ‘Pack-is-stan’ suddenly became ‘Pok-is-ston’ a few years ago?  Or has my California accent just heard it wrong all this time?  I do want to be audibly correct so as not to seem insensitive should I have the good fortune to visit the region someday. Thanks for the great newsletter, and the podcast which I have quickly come to enjoy very much.” &#8211; <b><i>Michael Grabowski</i></b><i>, Mission Viejo, Calif.</i></p>
<p><i> </i>[<i>Ed. note: There’s a little town in New York named Apalachin that’s name is pronounced “App-a-lay-kin.” But it’s in the northern range of the Appalachian Mountains, which in that part of the country are pronounced “app-a-lay-chin.” But if I was there to visit the scene of the famous meeting of New York mobsters that took place in 1957 and someone asked me where I was from, I might reply that I was of Appalachian origins, pronounced “app-a-latch-in.” So I guess I can understand your confusion! The short answer is that its regional. Where I grew up, people did and sometimes still do talk about the Allegheny Mountains instead of the Appalachians, but that is now generally understood to only refer to the range that runs from central Pennsylvania down to just north of Roanoke, Va. (Some of the most glorious sights in the continent are in this section. Visit the <b>George Washington</b> and <b>Thomas Jefferson</b> national forests if you ever get the chance.) Going back to the roots doesn’t help either. The root word is a Spanish corruption of the name of an indigenous tribe, now known as the Apalachee. But in West Virginia, it’s “app-a-latch-a,” and since West Virginia is better than other places, that’s good enough for me!</i>]</p>

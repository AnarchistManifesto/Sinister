<h3><strong>Measles</strong></h3>
<p>According to a<em> <strong>New England Journal of Medicine</strong></em> article, <strong><u>Epidemic Measles in a Highly </u></strong><strong><u>Vaccinated Population: During November, 1975, to May, 1976</u></strong>, <strong>measles occurred at a </strong><strong>rate of 20.3 cases per 1000 in a purported <u>immunized population</u>,</strong> of whom historical and serologic survey revealed that 9 per cent had no history of either measles illness or vaccination and 18 per cent did not have detectable measles antibody. <strong>…. </strong><strong><u>During a measles outbreak, more cases occurred in those receiving vaccine when less </u></strong><strong><u>than 12 months old than in those vaccinated at !12 months (37 per cent vs. 9 per cent, </u></strong><strong><u>P&lt;0.001).</u></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>USA: Illinois—<u>Measles Outbreak among Vaccinated High School Students</u></em></strong></p>
<p>From December 9, 1983, to January 13, 1984, 21 cases of measles occurred in Sangamon County, Illinois. Nine of the cases were confirmed serologically. <strong>The outbreak involved 16 high school students, all of whom had histories of measles vaccination after 15 months of age documented in their school health records. Of the five remaining cases, four occurred in unvaccinated preschool children, two of whom were under 15 months of age, and one case occurred in a previously vaccinated college student.</strong> ….

<p><strong>India halts vaccine programme after the deaths of four children.</strong></p>
<p>Vaccine programmes grind to a halt in India once more, when <strong><u>four children died after </u></strong><strong><u>they received the measles vaccination in Lucknow.</u></strong> <strong>The four children were reported to </strong><strong>have fainted soon after they were vaccinated and witnesses reported seeing the children’s eyes roll back as they began to have seizures. <u>All of the children were under the age of two years of age, with the youngest being just six months.

<p><strong>Conclusions: </strong>Among 12- to 23-month-olds who received their first dose of measles containing vaccine, fever and seizure were elevated 7 to 10 days after vaccination.</p>
<p><strong>Vaccination with MMRV results in 1 additional febrile seizure for every 2300 doses given instead of separate MMR + varicella vaccines</strong>. <strong>Providers who recommend MMRV should communicate to parents that it increases the risk of fever and seizure over that already associated with measles-containing vaccines</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>In 1975</strong>, when <strong>Japan stopped vaccinating children under the age of 2 years dramatic improvements in their infant mortality occurred. Japan’s place in the world scale of infant mortality went from 17, a poor position, to number 1, the best performance</strong>. It is quite clear that <strong><u>the shift of the lower vaccination limit to 2 years resulted in a dramatic decrease in SIDS going quickly from a very high to the lowest rate of infant deaths in the world</u></strong>. Between 1970 and 1974, 37 infant deaths occurred after DPT vaccination in Japan and because of this the doctors in one prefecture boycotted the vaccination.</p>

<p>“At the 34th Annual Meeting of the <strong>American Academy of Pediatrics</strong>, presented a study <strong>linking the DPT shot with SIDS.</strong> Torch concluded: <strong>“These data show that DPT vaccination may be a generally unrecognized major cause of sudden infant and early childhood death, <em><u>and that the risks of immunization may outweigh its potential benefits</u></em></strong>.

<h3>BCG Tuberculosis Vaccine</h3>
<p><strong><em>BCG Tuberculosis Vaccine  </em></strong><br /><strong><em>Russia</em></strong></p>
<p>In a <em><strong>Journal of Biological Standardization </strong></em><strong>article [</strong><strong>Volume 5, Issue 2</strong><strong>, 1977</strong>, Pages 149-153], “Characterization of the <strong>Soviet BCG vaccine </strong><strong>[tuberculosis prevention/control</strong>] and the occurrence of lymphadenitis [infection of lymph nodes/glands] in primarily vaccinated children,” <strong>A limited number of untoward reactions in children after BCG vaccination in the Soviet Union are described. They were mostly in the form of lymphadenitis but suppuration </strong><strong>[formation/discharge of pus] </strong><strong>and fistulation </strong><strong>[fistula formed</strong>: abnormal passageway between two organs in the body or between an organ and exterior of the body The Free Dictionary by Farlex] were observed.</p>
<h3>Pertussis [Whooping Cough] Vaccine</h3>
<p><strong><em>Israel</em></strong></p>
<p>Isaac Srugo, <em>et al</em>. affiliated with various public health centers in Israel stated, <strong><u>We demonstrated B. pertussis infection in fully vaccinated children ages 2-3 years and 5-6 years </u></strong><strong>who had contact with an infected child. We investigated whether younger or recently vaccinated<u> children may be protected from classical clinical illness but remain susceptible to infection and become asymptomatic carriers.</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>Vaccinated children may be asymptomatic reservoirs for infection.</strong></p>

<p><em><strong>The Times/The Sunday Times </strong></em><strong>of July 7, 2006</strong>, discusses a <strong><u>British Medical Journal </u></strong><strong><u>online article about whooping cough that says, </u></strong><strong><u>Millions of British children have probably been infected with whoopping cough even though they have been immunized against it. </u></strong>A study has found that nearly two in five children who went to their GP with a persistent cough had suffered from whooping cough, though very few doctors diagnose it. <strong><u>The results suggest that the whooping cough vaccine is ineffective at preventing infection, but makes symptoms less severe—thereby concealing just how common it remains</u></strong>.</p>

<p><strong><em>Australia </em></strong><strong>[Pertussis is on the rise!]</strong></p>
<p><strong><u>Whooping cough is on the rise in industrialised countries, despite long-standing vaccination programmes.</u></strong> Now <strong>researchers </strong>from the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia<strong>, have an explanation for why</strong>: <strong><u>at least two strains of the bacteria that cause the infection have evolved to evade today’s vaccines</u></strong>.</p>
<p>According to <em>The Daily Telegraph</em> of Sydney, “the research team analysed more than 200 samples of the bacterium collected over the past 40 years in Australia and compared them with samples from Japan, Canada, USA and Finland”. <strong>They found that there are at least two strains that the vaccine may not protect against – known as MT27 and MT70.</strong></p>
<p>At least in rich countries, many people may think that whooping cough – also known as pertussis – is a killer from a pre-vaccination era. The new study, which is published in this month’s edition of <strong>the journal <em>Emerging Infectious Diseases</em></strong>, <strong><u>emphasises that incidence rates have been recently increasing in many industrialised countries. Prior to this study, </u></strong><strong>scientists were unsure why.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Now it seems an upgrade to a new type of vaccine may be to blame.</strong> Up until 1997, a “whole-cell” vaccine was used before it was phased out over two years because of concerns about side effects. Since 1999, a new “acellular” vaccine has been used.</p>

<p><strong><em>The Netherlands</em></strong> [<strong>High rates despite widespread vaccination.]</strong></p>
<p>In The Netherlands, as in many other western countries, pertussis vaccines have been used extensively for more than 40 years. Therefore, it is conceivable that vaccine-induced immunity has affected the evolution of B. pertussis. <strong><u>Consistent with this notion, pertussis has reemerged in The Netherlands, despite high vaccination coverage</u></strong>. Further, a notable change in the population structure of B. Pertussis was observed in The Netherlands subsequent to the introduction of vaccination in the 1950s. <strong>Finally, we observed antigenic divergence between clinical isolates and vaccine strains, in particular with </strong><strong>respect to the surface-associated proteins pertactin and pertussis toxin. <u>Adaptation may have allowed B. Pertussis to remain endemic despite widespread vaccination and may have contributed to the reemergence of pertussis in The Netherlands</u></strong><u>.</u></p>

<p><strong><em>Slovenia</em></strong></p>
<p>Pertussis (whooping cough) is a mandatorily notifiable disease in Slovenia and since 1959, there has been an active national immunization programme. ….Whooping cough is highly infectious, and before vaccination was introduced, almost all children became infected. <strong><u>However, vaccination does not prevent the infection or asymptomatic carriage, and immunity wanes after vaccination.</u></strong> ….<strong>Some hypotheses for this apparent vaccine failure are: antigenic shift so that the circulating strains and vaccination strains of Bordetella pertussis diverge and vaccine efficacy is reduced; other factors, alone or in combination.</strong> …. <strong>The extent to which bacterial polymorphisms affect vaccine efficacy </strong>probably depends on the vaccine used, on the proportion of polymorphic bacteria in the human population, and other factors.</p>

<h3>Anomalies Regarding Vaccines</h3>
<p>[Vaccines don’t work in highly vaccinated populations!]</p>
<p><strong>So why, then, does <u>an article in the </u></strong><strong><u>Journal of the American Medical Association</u></strong> <strong>make this statement: </strong><strong>The risk of measles and pertussis is elevated in personal exemptors. Public health personnel should recognize the potential effect of exemptors in outbreaks in their communities, and parents should be made aware of the risks involved in not vaccinating their children. </strong><a href="http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/284/24/3145"><strong>http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/284/24/3145</strong></a><strong>  </strong><strong>when <u>it’s been demonstrated in various countries that measles and pertussis vaccines don’t work even with highly </u></strong><strong><u>vaccinated populations?</u></strong></p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<h3>HPV Vaccines</h3>
<p><strong><em>HPV Vaccines</em></strong><br /><strong>India: HPV Vaccines Deaths</strong></p>
<p><strong>Clinical trials using Gardasil® and Cervarix® vaccines were halted in India by the government on April 16, 2010 after the deaths of six tribal girls.</strong></p>

<p>Medical groups are accusing the Indian government for violating ethics and scientific logical proof in the drug company’s campaign to prove the vaccine works. …. <strong><u>There are over 120 side effects of Gardasil® and these quiet programs are not getting any media attention</u></strong>. …. Where are the studies and proof that the Gardasil® vaccine works? There is no proof and no testing and again like the H1N1 swine vaccine the mixture is not tested for causing cancer. <strong><u>The young children are being vaccinated 3 times with 3 doses and Gardasil has been proven deadly in Australia, Sri Lanki now in India and in the USA – children have died from this experimental Gardasil® and other vaccines.</u></strong></p>

<p>The reason the Indian government stopped the HPV vaccine from being distributed The HPV Vaccine: Science, Ethics and Regulation 28 november 27, 2010 vol xlv no 48 EPW Economic &amp; Political Weekly.</p>
<p>A recent civil society-led investigation has highlighted serious ethical violations in a trial of the Human Papilloma Virus vaccine on girls in Khammam district in Andhra Pradesh. The findings are presented along with a review of clinical trials of the hpv vaccine in India and an analysis of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act and Rules. Together they illustrate how the promotional practices of drug companies, pressure from powerful international organisations, [sic] and the co-option of, and uncritical endorsement by, India’s medical associations are influencing the country’s public health priorities.</p>

<p>Young people are being put at risk of permanent damage to their health and welfare by the failure of the IMB and others in positions of authority to provide the full facts about this unsafe, unnecessary, ineffective and costly vaccine.” While these national vaccination programs, which are being carried out in the UK as well as Ireland, will make the drug’s manufacturer, Merck, billions in profit, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has warned that Gardasil® may be responsible for an unknown number of deaths.</p>

<p><strong><u>FDA records show that 16 new deaths</u></strong> (including four suicides) and 3,589 “adverse reactions” tied to Gardasil were reported in the 16 months between May 2009 and September 2010. The adverse reactions included 213 cases of permanent disability. <strong>The FDA also received 25 reports of paralyzing Guillain Barre Syndrome in young girls and women who had received the vaccine.</strong></p>

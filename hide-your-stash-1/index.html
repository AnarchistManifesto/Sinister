<p>Barry Cooper is known as a film-maker, an anti-drug-war lecturer, criminal defense expert witness and law lecturer. Surprisingly, he even served as a church pastor, but it wasn’t until <em>“Never Get Busted”</em> and <em>“Kop Busters”</em> aired that he gained mainstream popularity.</p>
<p>He spent the first ten years of his life in California, but moved to Texas due to his father’s relocation in the military.</p>
<p>At a young age Mr. Cooper started training obedience and hunting dogs, which proved to be a great asset later in his career.</p>
<h2 id="theres-not-a-day-not-a-single-day-that-doesnt-go-by-on-the-interstate-that-we-dont-put-somebody-in-jail-for-narcotics-were-finding-mainly-marijuana-coca"><strong>“There’s not a day, not a single day that doesn’t go by on the interstate that we don’t put somebody in jail for narcotics. We’re finding mainly marijuana, cocaine, methamphetamine are the main three drugs we find… We find all of them.”</strong></h2>
<p>This statement was made by Barry Cooper after having Antony Reese arrested for the possession of a quarter of pound of marijuana drugs.</p>
<p>This was only one of the many drugs arrests such as drug trafficking and drug smuggling he made during his brazen law enforcement years.</p>
<p>At the begging of his career, at the young age of twenty-one, he confessed to not having a lot of life experience, but he was enthusiastic, full of drive to serve as an officer and believed in his calling at the time.</p>
<p>He was involved with FBI missions as well as ATF and DEA missions.</p>
<p>With the rapid increase of drugs users, the U.S. Government and the DEA implemented the Cannabis Eradication Program in 1979 and by 1985 all fifty states were included. The program taught young students of the pernicious effects of marijuana drugs.</p>
<p>However, Cooper soon came to realize that he held different views pertaining to this subject.</p>
<p>It was Jimmy Carter’s following statement that solidified some of his opposing beliefs on the matter.</p>
<h2 id="when-the-legal-side-effects-of-a-substance-cause-more-harm-to-the-person-than-the-side-effects-of-the-substance-itself-we-have-an-injustice"><strong><span style="background-color: #ffffff">“When the legal side effects of a substance cause more harm to the person than the side effects of the substance itself, we have an injustice.”</span></strong></h2>
<p>Cooper made many drugs arrests such as drug trafficking and drug smuggling and witnessed forceful entries, which left a permanent mark on him in the mental and spiritual sense.</p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>
<script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script></div>

<p>After coming to this realization, Cooper opted to follow his conscience, which soon led to the very end of his career as an interdiction officer.</p>
<p>After some time, Cooper felt the need to embark on a new project—something he could feel passionate about again.</p>
<p>So, he combined his skills and experience he acquired while he served in Law Enforcement, and basically became the voice of many Americans, especially those behind bars, who couldn’t communicate the things they wished to communicate on this matter.</p>
<p>His main point was that the “punishment of marijuana does not fit the crime.”</p>
<p><strong>Canines</strong></p>
<figure id="attachment_15862" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://darkwebnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/busted.jpg"><img src="image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" class="size-medium wp-image-15862" alt="busted. stamp. sticker. seal. round grunge vintage ribbon busted sign" width="300" height="220"><img class="size-medium wp-image-15862" src="https://www.sinister-sec.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/busted-300x220.jpg" alt="busted. stamp. sticker. seal. round grunge vintage ribbon busted sign" width="300" height="220"></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Barry Cooper is known as a film-maker, an anti-drug-war lecturer, criminal defense expert witness and law lecturer</figcaption></figure>
<p>Barry Cooper started training dogs at a very young age and was outstandingly successful implementing this “secret weapon” when making arrests related to drugs.</p>
<p>However, today he teaches on how not to get “busted.”</p>
<p>In a nutshell, he informs viewers of all the different ways in which they can avoid getting arrested.</p>
<p>One of the first points he address is the nature or type of a Narcotic Detector Dog.</p>
<p>He describes this type of a dog as the “ball dog” who constantly chases a ball.</p>
<p>These types of dogs are trained by using a ball, which contains marijuana drugs on the inside, but is seen as a mere toy by the canine.</p>
<p>The drugs are placed on the inside, so that the dog can get used to the smell and is able to recognize the drugs in the future.</p>
<p>Even though dogs do not have a great vision—they only see shades of black and grey and only two-dimensionally—they have an outstanding sense of smell, which allows them to separate different ingredients.</p>
<p>Furthermore, camouflaging marijuana drugs with foods like coffee or mustard usually ends in little or no success.</p>
<p>Another reason behind it basically boils down to the fact that all materials that the container, which holds the drugs or substance is made of is full of pores, through which the odor seeps through with time.</p>
<p>So, whether it is a gas tank or a PVC pipe, the odor eventually seeps through and the canine can easily detect the hidden marijuana drugs.</p>
<p>Cooper’s suggestions to avoid such snags include placing the drugs in uncontained containers—containers, which have not held marijuana drugs previously, so that the odor of marijuana drugs does not start to permeate instantly.</p>
<p>Also, using latex gloves is another suggestion Cooper gives, so that the user does not leave powder evidence of drugs on door knobs, car handles and other places he or she may touch.</p>
<p>Hiding marijuana drugs in foods like burger patties is also a pretty good idea according to Cooper, for reasons that the dog cannot communicate more than one thing to the officer.</p>
<p>In other words, even though a dog may get “excited,” the reason might as well be the burger patties.</p>
<p>However, unscrupulous officers, as Cooper refers to them, often use the method of False Alert.</p>
<p>This means that the officer uses words such as “ Get it” or “ Find it” which the dog is used to hearing during training, and in turn starts to scratch, giving the sign (on command) of detecting the drugs, when in reality he did not.</p>
<p>Thus, this can be seen as a loophole in the arrest protocol that officers can use to their advantage.</p>
<p>Consequently, more often than not, these types of scenarios conclude with an arrest, even though the person refused consent to search.</p>
<p><strong>Drugs – Conceal Your Stash</strong></p>
<p>One of the most frequent questions Barry Cooper is often asked is why does he help people break the law? Copper’s response is usually the following:</p>
<h2 id="18-million-americans-smoke-marijuana-every-day-42-percent-of-americans-from-the-age-of-12-to-infinity-have-tried-marijuana-at-least-once-in-their-life-the-law-is-already-being-broken"><span style="background-color: #ffffff"><strong>“18 million Americans smoke marijuana every day. 42 percent of Americans from the age of 12 to infinity have tried marijuana at least once in their life. The law is already being broken.”</strong></span></h2>
<p>His endeavors are really to simply protect the good and real Americans, as he refers to them, the ones who have families and children, so that they would not have to go to jail for making a “stupid” mistake of not hiding their stash well.</p>
<p>Cooper’s first suggestion is to wear latex gloves, so that the marijuana dust does not spread throughout the vehicle.</p>
<p>He urges drivers to avoid concealing their stash on the exterior of their cars, such as the gas cap compartment or the bumper because canines can easily smell it there.</p>
<p>Instead, he says one should hide it in the middle interior section of the vehicle, and as high as possible, because it is harder for dogs to sniff that high.</p>
<p>Concealing the drugs in easy-to-find places like the glove compartment is ill-advised because cops can spot it very easily.</p>
<p>Additionally, while hiding the drugs in an overnight bag can be convenient, it is not the smartest decision according to Cooper, since it is also a very easy spot to discover and sniff out.</p>
<p>Getting to know your car is highly suggested, because each and every vehicle is unique.</p>
<p>Most cars nowadays have a console with a top that can be easily lifted.</p>
<p>The inside portion of it is a good place to hide the marijuana drugs, says Cooper.</p>
<p>As an interdiction officer Cooper used to pat these inside portions of different crevices of cars to look for pounds of drugs, but he never took the time to look for a small joint (marijuana drugs).</p>
<p>Cooper also adds, if a person takes fifteen minutes to hide the marijuana drugs, the cops will probably spend about an hour to look for the drugs, which in turn can save the user years in jail.</p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>Another, funny, but useful tip he gives is swallowing the joint.  Cooper says,</p>
<h2 id="remember-its-not-illegal-to-smell-like-marijuana-its-illegal-to-possess-marijuana"><span style="background-color: #ffffff"><strong>“Remember, it’s not illegal to smell like marijuana, it’s illegal to possess marijuana.”</strong></span></h2>
<p>Placing the joint inside a straw and throwing it in a plastic bag is also a useful suggestion he provides.</p>
<p>Leaving joint buts in the ashtray, on the other hand, is a huge give-away, and gives cops reasonable cause for search.</p>
<p>Traveling with marijuana brownies or cookies is the safest way according to the experienced Barry Cooper.<br />
<strong>Drugs – Search and Seizure</strong></p>
<p><em>Search and Seizure Laws</em> is an important segment of Cooper’s series, for it informs people of different legal procedures that can take place when pulled over.</p>
<p>He brings up three major points: reasonable suspicion, probable cause and consent to search.</p>
<p>He starts with the description of reasonable suspicion and probable cause.</p>
<p>Essentially, these notions refer to all the little or big signs that may indicate that a person is in possession of marijuana drugs.</p>
<p>Even the smallest signs like a nervous handshake could indicate that something is wrong.</p>
<p>Also, if the officer notices a divergence at some point in the driver’s and the passenger’s story, it will give him even more reason to stay on the scene and interview them longer.</p>
<p>An interdiction officer uses his senses to detect if a crime is being committed.</p>
<p>If he sees marijuana in the ashtray, smells the odor of it or gets an alert from his canine, he then has probable cause and can search the vehicle without consent.</p>
<p>Continually, the officer can have only one probable cause and search the driver without consent, but can have fifty or more reasonable suspicions, but cannot search the car without the driver’s consent.</p>
<p>However, Cooper does urge people to agree to a search, because in most cases when they do not, they actually give more reason for doubt.</p>
<p>He also cautions them to remember that officers can use the false alert method with the help of their canine, which will naturally lead to a probable cause scenario.</p>
<p><strong>Drugs – Narcotics Profiling</strong></p>
<p>Barry Cooper also makes an introduction to narcotics profiling as he reveals what he was looking for on the interstate during his career as an interdiction officer.</p>
<p>In other words, he gives information on the exact type of person he would often pull over during his Law Enforcement career, or different signs that serve as red alerts to officers.</p>
<p>The type of person he would often pull over would be a long-haired male, usually in his thirties.</p>
<p>There were also instances where he spotted the driver (sometimes a college student), rolling a joint (marijuana drugs) as he was driving, which naturally led Cooper to intervene.</p>
<p>He was seldom suspicious of locals and older people.</p>
<p>Jesus Fish stickers, stickers supporting Law Enforcement and the inhibition of drugs are also seen as serious indicators that the driver might be a smuggler of drugs and/or a user of drugs.</p>
<p>Another important note on the matter is the following:</p>
<p>While profiling, Federal officers do not need a traffic violation to initiate traffic stop if they canarticulate reasonable suspicion why they believe a driver is involved in criminal activity (such as drugs).</p>
<p>State, County and City officers, on the other hand, must have a traffic violation to initiate a traffic stop.</p>
<p><strong>Drugs – Busted</strong></p>
<p>If the worst case scenario does take place, Barry Cooper’s advice is to make the most of your Miranda rights.</p>
<p>During and after the arrest, the arrestee is advised not to share any information that could be used against him or her in the court of law.</p>
<p>However, Cooper adds that in case the arrestee has some remaining drugs on him, he should give the drugs to the officer right on the spot.</p>
<p>Also, resisting can lead to additional charges, so keeping calm and poised is also an important suggestion.</p>
<p>Going to jail is probably one of the most traumatic experiences a person can have, says Barry Cooper.</p>
<p>Continually, making all the necessary phone calls is also highly advised as well as keeping in touch with the appointed bond person, who can make the bail.</p>
<p>Furthermore, during the trial, Cooper urges the arrestees to always plead not guilty and get an attorney with in-court experience.</p>
<p>Barry Cooper is mostly seen as an eccentric and controversial figure helping outlaws; however, some of his arguments resonate with many Americans, even with those who are not marijuana drugs users.</p>
<p>As someone who spent eight years as an interdiction officer and made numerous significant drugs arrests, he sure has a plethora of advice to give, which can help Americans avoid getting arrested.</p>

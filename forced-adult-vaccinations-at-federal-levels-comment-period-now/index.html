<p>The U.S. Health and Human Services published a 46-page draft proposal and notice in the Federal Register recently regarding more mandated vaccines for adults, and especially pregnant females; employer-enforced adult vaccinations; and probably for getting faith-based groups to uptake and not oppose vaccines/vaccinations.</p>
<p><b>There is an open public comment period that ends March 9, 2015, for consumers to register their comments, etc.</b> per instructions at <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2015/02/06/2015-02481/solicitation-of-written-comments-on-the-draft-national-adult-immunization-plan">this website</a>.</p>

<p>Written responses should be addressed to: National Vaccine Program Office, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 200 Independence Avenue SW., Room 733G, Washington, DC 20201. Attn: HHS Adult Immunization c/o Rebecca Fish.</p>
<p>The opening paragraph of the Executive Summary of the <b>“National Adult Immunization Plan”</b> draft dated February 5, 2015 says,</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>Vaccination is considered one of the most important public health achievements of the 20th century and continues to offer great promise in the 21st century. Vaccines save lives and improve the quality of life by preventing serious infectious diseases and their consequences. However, the benefits of vaccination are not realized equally across the U.S. population. Adult vaccination rates remain low in the United States, and significant racial and ethnic disparities also exist. [1]
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Probably, <b><i>nothing is more blatantly ridiculous and scientifically incorrect than the very first sentence.</i></b> Infectious disease after disease waned to extremely low levels of almost no infection and contraction rates numerous years before 20th century vaccines were even invented. <a href="http://preventdisease.com/news/pdf/InfectiousDiseaseVaccines.pdf">This website</a> contains more than two dozen charts and graphs indicating those documented historical facts.</p>

<p>However, vaccine makers unabashedly take credit for something that has become more of a health problem than a scientific advancement, in my opinion. All vaccines are super-saturated with horrendous neurotoxins and other toxic chemicals, non-human animal-source DNA, unknown viruses, fetal cell lines—aka diploid cells, and mycoplasmas, plus other ‘ingredients’—probably genetically-engineered-nanoparticles, which I discuss in detail in my 2013 book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Vaccination-Voodoo-What-About-Vaccines/dp/1484923820?tag=permacultucom-20&amp;linkCode=w13&amp;linkID=FGBNVPA47LBE2NTM&amp;ref_=assoc_res_sw_result_1"><b><i>Vaccination Voodoo, What YOU Don’t Know About Vaccines</i></b></a>.</p>
<p>Readers may want to know/have the peer-review published science papers cited in the book in order to corroborate damage vaccines and their ingredients cause, as part of their comments to the above HHS request.</p>
<p>Apparently and according to the HHS’s National Vaccine Plan (NVP),</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>While the NVP provides a vision for improving protection from vaccine-preventable diseases across the lifespan, <b>vaccination coverage levels among adults are not on track to meet Healthy People 2020 targets.</b> The National Vaccine Advisory Committee and numerous stakeholder groups have emphasized <b>the need for focused attention on <i>adult vaccines and vaccination</i>. </b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s what the new Federal Register publication is all about! Apparently, the feds want adults to get as many vaccines as MDs are pumping into children.</p>
<p>Furthermore,</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p><a style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 0em;margin-left: 1em" href="http://activistpost.net/vaccinetruth.html" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-38G3VOJQToQ/TfAZ2bc-qRI/AAAAAAAAJQ8/LA-TGAvVeWk/250x250-b.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="175"></a>The NAIP [National Adult Immunization Plan] is a five-year national plan. As a national plan, it will require engagement from a wide range of stakeholders to achieve its full vision. The plan emphasizes collaboration and prioritization of efforts that will have the greatest impact. <b>The NAIP also aims to leverage the unique opportunity presented by the implementation of the Affordable Care Act.</b> [Also known as “ObamaCare”]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are four key goals they want to establish by 2020 with the NAIP:</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>Goal 1: Strengthen <b><i>[obviously mandate and enforce]</i></b> the adult immunization infrastructure.</p>
<p>Goal 2: Improve access to adult vaccines. <b><i>[Have MDs hound adults to take vaccines like they do parents about kids’ vaccines.]</i></b></p>
<p>Goal 3: Increase community demand for adult immunizations. <b><i>[An interesting remark?]</i></b></p>
<p>Goal 4: Foster innovation <b><i>[What does that mean and can innovation include more toxins in vaccines than there are now? Could that mean nanoparticles or GMOs?]</i></b> in adult vaccine development and vaccination-related technologies. <b><i>[Technologies like getting vaccine patches or embedded RFID chips containing vaccines?] </i></b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to the draft report, the following vaccines probably are being mandated for adults:</p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that among US adults each year there are roughly 40,000 cases and 4,000 deaths attributable to invasive <b>pneumococcal </b>disease, between 3,000 and 50,000 deaths <b><i>[see facts below]</i></b> due to seasonal <b>influenza</b>, 9,000 cases of <b>pertussis</b>, approximately 3,000 cases of acute <b>hepatitis B</b>, and about one million cases of <b>herpes zoster</b>. Adults have also been affected in recent outbreaks of other vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles. With the aging of the U.S. population, the public health impact of vaccine-preventable diseases and their complications in adults is likely to grow. The <b><u>diminishing function of the aging immune system</u> reduces the immune response to vaccination and underscores the need to develop more effective products for older adults. [CJF emphasis added] </b></p>
</blockquote>
<p><i><b>Facts about seasonal influenza: </b></i></p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p><b><i>On their own website</i>, the CDC states</b> that <b>flu deaths between 1976 and 2006 ranged from a low of 3,000 people to a high of 49,000.</b> But <b><i><u>they also reported on their website that only 500 people died from flu in 2010.</u> </i></b>“The fact is, the outrageous claims of 3,000 to 49,000 deaths are inaccurate numbers,” says holistic family physician Dr. David Brownstein. “They are just guesswork.” [12] <b>[CJF emphasis added] </b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is that a case of “Liar, liar—pants on fire?” So, how can anyone believe the CDC’s hyper- inflated statistics? So, in the draft flu deaths are up to 50,000—a nice round figure!</p>
<p>What neither HHS, the CDC/FDA, nor anyone associated with the vaccine industry will admit to, I contend, is this: With all the vaccines they have mandated for children since the middle 1980s—supposedly for entry into schools—they have – either accidentally or deliberately – created reduced-functioning immune systems that cannot perform in the manner Nature and life intends and genetically programs.</p>
<p>Vaccine makers, in effect, have created what they think is ‘immunity’, which actually is an <b><i>antigen response</i></b> that, consequently, can produce inflammatory processes in the body, including the brain. An apparent end result is deficient immune systems as children grow into adulthood and older. Chronic “old-age diseases” now are plaguing young children! See <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3319320/">“Coping with Chronic Illnesses in Childhood and Adolescence”</a> (2012) .</p>
<p><a style="float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em" href="http://activistpost.net/backyardliberty.html" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ONE8Lk_RzR8/UjeZnRyZRTI/AAAAAAAAVJw/TMNS4NzHKZo/s220/BL_158220.gif" alt=""></a>“Diminishing function of the aging immune system” clearly will result in—and federally require—periodic re-vaccination in order to effectuate Big Pharma’s vaccination-produced acquired immune system, which apparently malfunctions, in my opinion. How many fully-vaccinated individuals contract the very diseases for which they are vaccinated? [11] How many children have allergies, asthma, and other immune problems? See <a href="http://www.aaaai.org/about-the-aaaai/newsroom/allergy-statistics.aspx">allergy stats here</a>. Wow!</p>
<p>The <i><b>diminishing function of the aging immune system</b></i> is an unfortunate health status that results, I think, from decades of HHS, CDC, FDA, Congress, and the media apparently believing—plus promoting—‘tobacco-science’ produced by Big Pharma, that’s propagated by corporate money and lobbyists, in my opinion.</p>
<p>By injecting toxins into newborn infants, then babies at 2, 4, and 6 months of age, and toddlers during the timeline when the human immune system is not fully developed—that happens for a child between two and three years of age—federal health agencies basically have ‘castrated’ almost two generations of individuals’ immune systems, thereby leaving them susceptible to diminishing functions of the immune system and contracting infectious communicable diseases—even when vaccinated—as current statistics are proving. A good percentage of those contracting communicable diseases are fully vaccinated! Now, the feds are going after “catch-up” vaccinations for adults, thinking that will help, as discussed in the Introduction of the report on page 1.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this information needs to be ‘digested’:</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>As shown in Table 1, despite the health benefits that result from implementation of ACIP recommendations, adults continue to be vaccinated at low and variable rates. In contrast, <b>childhood vaccination rates in the United States typically exceed 90 percent.</b><i> [As a result, we have sicker kids than ever before, plus the Autism rate is 1 in 50, whereas in the late 1970s, that rate was 1 in 10,000! Furthermore, more vaccinees are contracting vaccinated-against diseases that the feds want to blame either on unvaccinated children or now, adults!]</i> The success of childhood vaccination <i>[Can one call so much Autism success?]</i> can be attributed to many factors unique to pediatric vaccination, such as state laws requiring vaccination for school entry and the coordinated public health infrastructure established by the Vaccines for Children Program (VFC), a federally funded program to provide free vaccines to children who are Medicaid eligible, uninsured, underinsured, or American Indian or Alaskan Native.</p>
<p>Another reason for the high rates of vaccination among children is that pediatricians and family physicians, the primary providers of health care and preventive health services for children, have <b>long been committed to making immunization a core part of well-child care.</b> <i> [Probably, those ‘well baby’ visits after birth should be called something else because so many children become damaged after receiving vaccines. Check the VAERS reports!] </i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On page 3 of the HHS draft, and throughout, reference is made to “stakeholder groups”. Just who are they? Furthermore, aren’t the largest “stakeholders” involved, all adults in the USA? Furthermore, I’m questioning the effect citizens’ comments and input will have, since the draft is written as something that’s a given—<i>fait accompli</i>! In reading the draft, readers can learn what “barriers” those stakeholder groups and researchers discuss.</p>
<p>It seems the Affordable Care Act [aka “ObamaCare”] has been more than influential regarding mandatory adult vaccinations. “In addition, <b>passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010 was an important milestone for adult vaccination in the United States</b>. …. Furthermore, more than 71 million individuals in private plans have gained expanded access to vaccinations and other preventive services coverage without cost-sharing under the Affordable Care Act.23” [Pg.4]</p>
<p>This, on page 4, is rather interesting:</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>In 2014, NVAC published updated Standards for Adult Immunization Practice to emphasize that <b>all providers who care for adults are responsible for assessing immunization needs at every clinical encounter, strongly recommending needed vaccines, administering recommended vaccines, and <u>documenting receipt in a state immunization information system.</u></b> <b><u>The standards also instruct providers who do not vaccinate to refer adult patients to a vaccinating provider.</u></b> <i>[CJF emphasis added] </i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And this:</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p><b>Medicare beneficiaries may encounter financial barriers</b> when accessing vaccines covered by Medicare Part D (e.g., <b>herpes zoster</b> vaccine and <b>tetanus</b>, <b> diphtheria</b>, and <b>pertussis </b>[Tdap] vaccine). Medicare Part B covers select vaccines without cost-sharing; however, cost-sharing for vaccines covered under Medicare Part D varies widely from plan to plan and <b>may be cost-prohibitive for some patients</b>. [Pg.4] <i>[CJF emphasis added] </i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, following is an area/arena where the plan probably will encounter resistance:</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>The success of this plan will depend on the synergies between state, local, territorial, and tribal governments; health care providers; advocacy groups; vaccine manufacturers; academia and research organizations; payers and health plans; employers; and the general public to work together to overcome barriers and improve access to adult vaccinations. [Pp.5-6]</p>
<p>RAND Corporation [8] was enlisted to review historic literature, interview stakeholders, and collect data to identify plan priorities and key indicators. [Pg.8]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The feds apparently expect this plan to produce Healthy People by 2020. Well, if I can offer a forecast, I think it will be this: The USA will have such an overabundance of dreadfully seriously sick citizens, from all age groups, that no one will know what to do. However, senior citizens—75 and older—probably will be mandated by law to be subject to compulsory and legal euthanasia. Do you think that’s in ObamaCare too?</p>
<p><b>Pregnant females are being targeted very prominently. </b></p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>In addition, NVAC provides forward-looking analyses to identify barriers and challenges to research and <b>development of new vaccines specifically for pregnant women.</b> [Pg.10]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, HHS submits this under Goal 1 on page 11:</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>Objective 1.3 Continue <b>to analyze claims filed as part of the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) to identify potential causal links between vaccines and adverse events. </b></p>
</blockquote>

<a href="http://www.zengardner.com/us-media-blackout-italian-court-rules-vaccines-cause-autism/">Recent Italian Court Decisions on Vaccines and Autism</a></p>
<p>Then, as recently as 2014, <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2015/02/the-cdc-vaccineautism-whistleblowers.html">William Thompson, PhD, blew the whistle</a> on how he fudged vaccine study papers regarding the link between vaccines and Autism.</p>
<p>So, can the CDC be trusted to identify causal links between vaccines and adverse events and correct them since, apparently, past history has proven they conspire to hide them?</p>
<p>On Page 12 under Objective 1.2, this appears:</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>Vaccines have a long track record of safety and effectiveness in adults…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Are they kidding—seriously? <b><i>Furthermore, safety tests are not performed by the FDA on vaccines!</i></b> Back in 1976, the flu vaccine was involved in a memorable number of adverse events:</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>However, side-effects from the vaccine are thought to have caused five hundred cases of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillain%E2%80%93Barr%C3%A9_syndrome">Guillain–Barré syndrome</a> and 25 deaths. [2]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to the authors of the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Swine-Flu-Affair-Decision-Making/dp/1410222020?tag=permacultucom-20&amp;linkCode=w13&amp;linkID=FGBNVPA47LBE2NTM&amp;ref_=assoc_res_sw_result_1"><i>The Swine Flu Affair</i></a>, contracting paralyzing Guillain-Barré syndrome is 11 times greater with vaccination than without. [2]</p>
<p>However, there just may be a perfect example of how the CDC/FDA licenses supposedly ‘safe’ vaccines. What happened with the Rotavirus <i>RotaShield </i>vaccine should never have happened <b><i>IF</i></b> the FDA did its own safety testing with outside independent scientists, and not take manufacturers’ ‘tobacco science’, in my opinion. So how safe was that Rotavirus vaccine for children?</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>10/15/1999</p>
<p>Rotavirus: First Vaccine Withdrawn</p>
<p>The first vaccine for rotavirus, a common cause of severe childhood diarrheal illness, RotaShield, was licensed and recommended for routine childhood immunization in 1998. Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, however, withdrew the vaccine in 1999 due to safety concerns. <b>Scientists associated the vaccine with a rare intestinal problem called intussusception, a potentially fatal telescoping of part of the bowel.</b> [3]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore,</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>According to the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm4843a5.htm">CDC</a> in 1999, rotavirus was causing <b>20 to 40 infant deaths annually</b> in the US when the first rotavirus vaccine, RotaShield, was introduced. It was <b>estimated</b> that about 50,000 hospitalizations occurred in the US because of severe diarrhea and dehydration. [9] <i>[CJF emphasis added]</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Vaccine safety is not a given truth nor a fact! See the VAERS adverse events reports, which statistically represent between 1 and 10 percent of adverse reactions reported, since doctors apparently are lax to report vaccine damage. It’s considered “coincidental”. Many vaccinees are harmed by mandatory vaccinations, as numerous photographs at the end of <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/048691_vaccine_damaged_children_graphic_photos_medical_mutilation.html"><b>this article</b></a> graphically verifies. Be prepared for upsetting photos of children damaged very badly.</p>
<p>No one — babies, toddlers, teens, adults or senior citizens — should be mandated to receive toxins injected into their bodies that can create such horrendous health conditions or even the paralyzing Guillain–Barré–Strohl syndrome.</p>
<p>Constitutional attorney Jonathan Emord tells how the FDA approved one drug in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=Tgf-nBeI1g8#t=0">this video</a>.  Do you believe how that drug was approved? <i><b>No real studies were done! </b></i></p>
<p>On Page 13, we find this,</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">

<p><a style="float: left;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-right: 1em" href="http://activistpost.net/noglasses.html" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-UfhQ4VGaJCk/UHMzZ13ZBJI/AAAAAAAAAPA/8_9Z0b_r7CM/s160/ad5%25283%2529.jpg" alt=""></a>which I think is most disconcerting insofar as, when I studied nutrition and consumer health, pregnant women were told not to take any types of medication at all—not even aspirin! [10]</p>
<p>Again, I’d like to make a prediction: Newborns will have more health problems than at any time in medical history! Between vaccines given to pregnant mothers, which probably will cross the placental wall, and all the ultrasound frequencies from as early as 6 to 7 weeks in pregnancy, babies surely are going to birth with more ‘fried’ brains than ever. Ultrasound/sonograms can cause cavitation in brain cells.</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">

</blockquote>
<p>Then, inject Hepatitis B vaccines within 24 hours after infants are born…OMG! Personally, as a retired healthcare professional, I’m compelled to ask, “Do they really know what they are doing?”</p>
<p>In the draft they talk about resolving vaccine injury claims and VEARS in several places. However, the track record at the “Vaccine Court” is less than admirable or equitable, I’d say. As of the end of fiscal 2014, there were <b>3,540 claims paid </b>but <i><b>9,734 were dismissed</b></i>—almost a 3 to 1 ratio of vaccine adverse events claims NOT paid. And, when that happens to you or your child, you are saddled for life with medical bills that are unimaginable! [5]</p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>Under the topic “Increase Community Demand for Adult Immunizations,” we find that there apparently will be constant ‘badgering’ campaigns to receive vaccinations. Numerous pages about “how to” indicate that it’s going to be unavoidable, plus probably “in-your-face” too, and everywhere!</p>

<p>Probably, the most frightening statement, in my opinion, is found on Page 24:</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>One of the five goals of the NVP is to develop new and improved vaccines.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First of all, there are too many vaccines now that are harmful. Furthermore, what will Pharma produce in the future when everyone will have to receive vaccines for which Big Pharma have no legal liability to produce safe vaccines or vaccines that are tested for their abilities to produce cancer, interfere with fertility/cause infertility, or cause birth defects? Currently, NO vaccines are tested for those health adverse events. Every vaccine package insert states that those tests have not been done! So, how are vaccines proven to be safe, if we don’t know if they can cause cancer, especially since they contain numerous toxic chemicals? Good question?</p>
<p>Here’s another prediction I’m offering: Everyone in the USA will have to get a vaccination a day! Maybe two, since there are hundreds of new vaccines in developmental pipelines from what I know.</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>Implementing the NAIP will require not just federal action, but also national action. [Pg.26]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em" href="http://activistpost.net/miraclecure.html" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-cy2Lpzbsd5E/U35cEf2njVI/AAAAAAAAAow/cu-TTd9iPO4/s220/300x250.gif" alt=""></a>By 2020, the feds want 100 percent of all pharmacists administering vaccines! [Pg.29]</p>
<p>In the draft’s base year of 2012, only 45 percent of adults received a provider-recommended flu shot; whereas by 2020, they want 90 percent compliance! Flu vaccines apparently don’t fare very high in efficacy ratings or safety for children or adults. <a href="http://www.nvic.org/nvic-archives/pressrelease/influenza-vaccine-safety.aspx">(Source)</a></p>
<p>When I read this on Page 31, I shouted, “WHAT?”</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>*Note that the published immunization schedule does not include 2014 ACIP recommendations related to the use of <b>13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine among adults aged ≥65 years. </b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally, valents in a vaccine refer to an antigen or organism for a specific disease. So, a 13-valent vaccine means 13 antigens, while the 23-valent vaccine means 23 antigens! Antigens usually are associated with aluminum in order to produce/acquire ‘an adaptive immune response’ [6]—in any combination of four formulations: Aluminum hydroxide, Aluminum hydroxyphosphate sulfate, Aluminum phosphate, and Aluminum potassium sulfate.</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>Vaccines may be <i>monovalent </i>(also called <i>univalent</i>) or <i>multivalent </i>(also called <i>polyvalent</i>). A monovalent vaccine is designed to immunize against a single antigen or single microorganism.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine#cite_note-16">[16]</a> A multivalent or polyvalent vaccine is designed to immunize against two or more strains of the same microorganism, or against two or more microorganisms. [7]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a lot at stake in the HHS draft regarding vaccines that needs to be considered very carefully from all angles and by everyone, I think. Many adults have acquired immunity from having contracted infectious childhood diseases and should not be vaccinated, if that’s the case. There are blood tests that can establish one’s immunity to infectious diseases—rather than risk toxic vaccine ingredients, which everyone ought to know about. I’ve listed them here:</p>

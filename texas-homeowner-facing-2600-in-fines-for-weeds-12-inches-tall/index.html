<p>Home ownership in America is not what it used to be. For a frugal  family who pays off their mortgage according to its terms, they still  have to look forward to a lifetime of rising property taxes in order to  keep a roof over their heads. In many municipalities, property taxes are  arbitrarily raised annually by the maximum amount allowed each year by  law, rather than by an honest assessment of current property values. For some  homeowners, this can mean that regardless of what the market is  actually doing, their appraisals can and do rise up to 10% each year.  Failure to pay property taxes, of course, can result in liens against  the home or even foreclosure.</p>
<p>Nowadays, however, there is an even more sinister and backwards <a href="http://www.wakingtimes.com/2014/02/11/city-ordinance-nightmare-texas-homeowner-facing-2600-fines-weeds/" title="City Ordinance Nightmare – Texas Homeowner Facing $2600 in Fines for ‘Weeds’ 12 Inches Tall">threat to American homeowners</a>, a direct assault on life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that truly has no place in a free society.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>Enforcement of ordinance codes, which are municipal decrees by local  bureaucrats, not laws, and homeowner’s association regulations are  leaving far too many honest and hard-working Americans in dire straits,  financial ruin and under extreme duress for committing infractions that  should not be considered criminal by any stretch of the imagination.</p>
<p>All across America today, we are witnessing the growing <a href="http://www.wakingtimes.com/2012/12/20/food-taxes-and-penalization-are-not-solutions-to-public-health-problems/" title="Food Taxes and Penalization are Not Solutions to Public Health Problems">tyranny of petty rules</a>  and regulations deliberately aimed at raising revenue for government;  and in Corpus Christi, Texas, longtime residents and homeowners Paul  and Sally Hunt have found out the hard way that when the City wants more  from you, it takes more.</p>

In 2010, The Hunt family, who had legally operated a plant nursery and <a href="http://www.wakingtimes.com/2013/03/12/propaganda-gardening-the-evolution-of-revolution/" title="Propaganda Gardening – The Evolution of Revolution">gardening</a>  business for years on the property where they reside, were called to  care for an elderly relative in neighboring state, Louisiana. While  caring for Mrs. Hunt’s aging father, a bona fide nonagenarian and former  WWII pilot who suffers from severe dementia, the Corpus Christi <a href="http://www.wakingtimes.com/2013/03/14/the-sububs-is-america-accidentally-self-organizing-into-labor-camps/" title="The Suburbs: Is America Accidentally Self-Organizing Into Labor Camps?">code enforcement</a>  department apparently trespassed upon their private property and took a  ruler to the plants growing in the front yard, then issued a formal  complaint for ‘weeds and brush over 12 inches.’</p>
<p>Since the Hunts were out of town at the time, the plants in the yard  had apparently grown taller than the city manager deemed forgivable, an  astonishing 12 inches tall, and now the Hunts are facing a whopping  $2600 fine for out of control ‘weeds,’ plus an enduring battle with City Hall that has had them buried in proceedings for almost 2 years.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Mr. Hunt… “did intentionally, knowingly, recklessly or  with criminal negligence as an owner or occupant of a lot or parcel of  land… permit or allow weeds or brush twelve (12) inches high or higher  to grow on said lot or parcel of land, contrary to Section 23-70 of the  Code of Ordinances, City of Corpus Christi…”  [<a href="https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Hunt-Complaint.jpg" target="_blank">Source</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The City could have, of course, contacted Mr. Hunt and given him an  opportunity to rectify this unlawful grievance, as his mail and phone  were forwarded to their temporary residence in Louisiana. Had they done  so, Mr. Hunt, who had up until this time of family duress kept his  property well-maintained, could have contacted any number of friends or  services to meet the city’s code requirements. In fact, Mr. Hunt had  already employed several lawn services to do exactly this; however, they  were unfortunately unable to meet the city’s standards. In spite of the  potential for several amicable and easy solutions to this crisis, the  Hunt family was cruelly given zero opportunity to rectify the situation  before receiving such stiff fiscal punishment and threats of even  harsher penalties.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/jurisdictionary.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" class="noshadow" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-1Vk1X0AyC2M/TU2VFtGb-PI/AAAAAAAAGeg/_jLIxUQ_jLw/Judicialtyranny3.jpg" style="border: medium none"></a>Even more distressing is the fact that even before this case went to  trial, before the Hunts were given the opportunity to explain  themselves to a civic court judge, and before an official fine had been  set, the City of Corpus Christi hired a collections agency to harass the  Hunt family, who has excellent credit and carries zero personal debt, for  the collection of an arbitrary $2600.</p>
<p>If this sounds way over the top to you and severely heavy handed, that’s because it is, but it gets weirder.</p>
<p><b>It Gets Weirder</b></p>
<p>The Hunt family’s ongoing legal nightmare officially began with a  letter from the City of Corpus Christi in 2012, which informed Mr. Hunt  that the City was filing suit against him for this infraction, which  occurred in 2010. Between 2010 when the citation was issued and 2012,  the Hunt family was not notified in any manner that they had committed a  crime two years prior.</p>
<p>Mr. Hunt contacted the City to find out exactly what was happening, and  upon investigation he was informed by former Corpus Christi City  Attorney, Carlos Valdez, that the City has ‘zero obligation’ to inform  citizens of a code violation or a proceedings against them. Mr. Valdez  also stated that the City could have a hearing in a case like this  without ever notifying the defendant, and if a person did not show up –  even if they did not know about the hearing – the City was under legal  authority to have them arrested.</p>
<p>This means that the City can fine someone for any number of ordinance  violations, never notify them, have a court date without their  knowledge or presence, then issue an arrest warrant, all before a  citizen has had any notion of wrongdoing.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in a pre-trial hearing on September 24, 2012, Mr. Hunt  appealed to the City’s prosecuting attorney, asking the obvious  question, ‘what is the definition of a weed?’ The City attorney’s reply  was shocking as she leaned forward across the table and whispered, “Uh,  well, we don’t have a definition for weeds. No one has ever asked us  that question” (her exact words). The attorney then motioned for  continuance and set a future trial date.</p>
<p><b>Tip of the Iceberg</b></p>
<p>An Eagle Scout and former Boy Scout leader, environmental  professional and orchid farmer who is now semi-retired and licensed by  the State of Texas to instruct concealed handgun permit classes, Paul  Hunt is perhaps one of the few remaining Americans unwilling to bend  over and be bullied by such petty tyrants employed in big government.  For this, he has yet refused to admit guilt and has refused to pay off  the city, instead begrudgingly engaging in a long, tiring, expensive,  and time-consuming battle with city hall in order to maintain and assert  basic property rights in America.</p>
<p>In the process of this struggle, Mr. and Mrs. Hunt have uncovered an  alarming pattern of abuse, primarily aimed at the city’s lower income  families and property owners. They have discovered hundreds of cases  similar to his, where petty fines have been issued to tax-paying  citizens and homeowners for nonsensical infractions against an  ever-growing list of city codes. In many cases the defendants were never  notified until suits had been filed against them, warrants were issued,  and collection agencies had begun harassing them.</p>
<p>In their ongoing quest for legal representation in this battle, the  Hunts have interviewed dozens of attorneys and, sadly, none will take  the case. The consensus being that homeowners simply cannot win these  types of fights in the King’s court and that Corpus Christi, Texas in  particular is widely recognized as a lost cause for battling for  property rights.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/stopcollections.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 0em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/_qLAIskTQXUc/TZ933pN8SGI/AAAAAAAAIHc/YCYFRV5llC0/240x400.jpg"></a>Homeowners  across America are feeling the wrath of for-profit local governments  filled with bureaucrats who don’t seem concerned with personal liberty  and sovereignty, or even with treating the citizenry with fairness or  even basic respect. Legally, the City of Corpus Christi, and many others in the  US, are openly violating due process, as well as violating the 4th, 5th, and 14th Constitutional  Amendments, which are codified to protect Americans from government  abuse. Code enforcement is swiftly becoming the most frequently used  political tool to generate revenue for local governments and to invade  the privacy of people who wish to live in peace in accordance with the  law. The Hunts are not at all unique in this regard, and are sadly just  another honest family caught up in a growing trend of government abuse.</p>
<p><b>Pattern of Property Rights Abuse</b></p>
<p>Another egregious case of property rights violations by the city of  Corpus Christi was publicized last November concerning a woman who had  constructed a fence around her property in violation of City codes. The  neighbors complained for its unsightliness and the City finally came out  with guns drawn and broke into her home to “look” for other code  violations. The owner of the property was hauled off for a psychiatric  evaluation and in January 2014 the City had this woman’s fence removed,  and she has since been forced to move.</p>
<p>Regarding this case, City of Corpus Christi Assistant City Manager  Susan Thorpe said the issue of code enforcement is raising eyebrows, and  questions, at City Hall. She stated that many are asking whether state  property rights laws hinder the City from handling its toughest code  violations, and that the City needs more authority to take down nuisance  violations when owners refuse to do it themselves.</p>
<p>In other words, the City is looking for ways to trump state law when  it deems fit, in order to seize sufficient authority to bully its own  residents.</p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>Other nationwide cases of abuse of government authority similar to this include:</p>
<ul>
<li>2013 – Massive SWAT raid, aerial surveillance and 10-hour search of the Garden of Eden organic farm in Arlington, Texas</li>
<li>2013 – Miami Shores, Florida city uproots couple’s 17-year-old garden over new ordinances</li>
<li>2012 – Tulsa, Oklahoma city code enforcer cut down woman’s edible and medicinal garden with no cause</li>
<li>2012 – Couple forced to remove garden to avoid $500 a day in fines by Orlando, Florida city</li>
<li>2013 – Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania residents being fined for parking in their own driveways</li>
<li>2009 – Woman in Nashville, Tennessee fined for leaving her keys in her car in her own driveway</li>
<li>2011  – Woman faced 93 days in jail for refusing to remove her edible garden in Oak Park, Michigan</li>
<li>2013 – Florida City to evict woman from her paid for home for her ‘off the grid’ lifestyle</li>
</ul>
<p>The list truly goes on and on, and the growing trend of abuse by  municipal governments is showing no signs of abatement. Please add any  similar stories to the comments section at the end of this article.</p>
<p><b>Where Does this Authority Come From? Agenda 21 – The Real Nightmare</b></p>
<p>So, where do local bureaucrats and unelected city ‘officials’ derive  the authority to treat tax-paying members of the community with such  disregard, disrespect and dishonesty?</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/foodcrisis.html" rel="nofollow" style="float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-gSYYiihhpjI/TtEcIO54fhI/AAAAAAAAM2s/G6yL-FN6K7A/s261/foodcrisis-160-2.gif"></a>In this case, the Texas Constitution does not grant local  jurisdictions the power to make law, meaning that city ordinances are  not laws; therefore, Texas State residents are not legally required to  obey such ordinances. However, this appears to be open to legal  interpretation at this point, meaning that cities are able to enact and  enforce ordinance codes against their populations, who generally do not  have the knowledge, representation or resources to combat this.</p>
<p>Additionally, and here’s where the story gets frightening and should  cause concern for all property owners in the United States, it appears  that in this case these ordinances were adopted verbatim from the United  Nations Agenda 21 charter for global sustainable development. Across  the United States, and the world, cities and states are adopting, ICC  (International Code Council) codes aimed at bringing uniformity to the  enforcement of sustainability as decided by regulatory committees acting  under the purview of Agenda 21.</p>
<p>It is difficult to find complete information on how exactly these  codes and ordinances are introduced to local governments who have no  apparent direct connection to the United Nations, yet across this  country we are seeing a rise in the adoption of uniform ICC codes.  Agenda 21 legislation is directly aimed at forcing all nations onto a  standardized legal rulebook established by non-local, non-elected  bureaucrats who are asserting the right to govern the world by means of  punitive and excessive fines and heavy-handed enforcement practices.</p>

<p>In other words, your local town may be adopting absurdly punitive  rules generated by far away ‘authorities,’ then enforcing those rules  against tax-paying homeowners in blatant disregard for State and  Federal law.</p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p>Mr. Hunt has put up resistance to this tyranny out of moral  principle, and although this issue has not yet been resolved in court,  he has had several court appearances (arraignment hearings, etc.) with  more to come, representing a significant and ongoing burden of time,  energy, and money… all over plants that grew to 12 inches tall while he  was away caring for a sick relative. To add irony to this insult and  injury, it is worthwhile to note that the Hunts’ property is next to a  railroad track in the industrial sector of town and shares a lengthy  fence line with an automotive junkyard, and is half a block from a salvage yard who has long been accused of  polluting the air with chemicals and debris.</p>
<p>Should honest, hard-working, tax-paying citizens be forced to into  such duress by their local governments because of cosmetic issues such  as plants higher than 12 inches? No.</p>
<p>What is your take on this growing problem? Should our government,  that we pay for, be permitted to unforgivably harass and fine people  out of their homes for cosmetic violations decreed by city employees?</p>
<p>Please leave your comments below. And if personal liberty and the  right to be left alone by overzealous bureaucrats is important to you,  then please take a moment to contact the Corpus Christi City Government  on behalf of the Hunt family and voice your outrage against their  treatment and the treatment of hundreds of other citizens who are facing  outrageous fines and persecution for petty violations of tyrannical  code enforcement.</p>
<p>Mr. Paul Hunt is also available for comment or interview and can be contacted by emailing phunt@dihcro.com.</p>

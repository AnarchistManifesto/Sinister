It has nefarious roots and is the tap-root of modern globalization. ⁃ TN Editor</div>
</div>
<h3 align="left"><span style="font-family: Georgia"><b>Preface</b></span></h3>
<p align="left"><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman', Times, serif">When David Rockefeller and Zbigniew Brzezinski founded the Trilateral Commission in 1973, the intent was to create a “New International Economic Order” (NIEO). To this end, they brought together 300 elite corporate, political and academic leaders from North America, Japan and Europe.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman', Times, serif">Few people believed us when we wrote about their nefarious plans back then. Now, we look back and clearly see that they did what they said they were going to do… globalism is upon us like an 8.6 magnitude earthquake.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman', Times, serif">The question is, “How did they do it?” Keep in mind, they had no public mandate from any country in the world. They didn’t have the raw political muscle, especially in democratic countries where voting is allowed. They didn’t have global dictatorial powers.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman', Times, serif">Indeed, how did they do it?</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman', Times, serif">The answer is the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), self-described as the “central bank for central bankers”, that controls the vast global banking system with the precision of a Swiss watch.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman', Times, serif">This report offers a concise summation of BIS history, structure and current activities.</span></p>
<h3 align="left"><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman', Times, serif"><b>Introduction</b></span></h3>
<p align="left"><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman', Times, serif">The famous currency expert Dr. Franz Pick once stated, “The destiny of the currency is, and always will be, the destiny of a nation.”</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman', Times, serif">With the advent of rampant globalization, this concept can certainly be given a global context as well: “The destiny of currencies are, and always will be, the destiny of the world.”</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman', Times, serif">Even though the BIS is the oldest international banking operation in the world, it is a low profile organization, shunning all publicity and notoriety. As a result, there is very little critical analysis written about this important financial organization. Further, much of what has been written about it is tainted by its own self-effacing literature.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman', Times, serif">The BIS can be compared to a stealth bomber. It flies high and fast, is undetected, has a small crew and carries a huge payload. By contrast, however, the bomber answers to a chain of command and must be refueled by outside sources. The BIS, as we shall see, is not accountable to any public authority and operates with complete autonomy and self-sufficiency.</span></p>
<h3 align="left"><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman', Times, serif"><b>Leading up to Founding</b></span></h3>
<p align="left"><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman', Times, serif">As we will see, the BIS was founded in 1930 during a very troubled time in history. Some knowledge of that history is critical to understanding why the BIS was created, and for whose benefit.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman', Times, serif">There are three figures that play prominently in the founding of the BIS: Charles G. Dawes, Owen D. Young and Hjalmar Schacht of Germany.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman', Times, serif">Charles G. Dawes was director of the U.S. Bureau of the Budget in 1921, and served on the Allied Reparations Commission starting in 1923. His latter work on “stabilizing Germany’s economy” earned him the Nobel Peace Prize in 1925. After being elected Vice President under President Calvin Coolidge from 1925-1929, and appointed Ambassador to England in 1931, he resumed his personal banking career in 1932 as chairman of the board of the City National Bank and Trust in Chicago, where he remained until his death in 1951.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman', Times, serif">Owen D Young was an American industrialist. He founded RCA (Radio Corporation of America) in1919 and was its chairman until 1933. He also served as the chairman of General Electric from 1922 until 1939. In 1932, Young sought the democratic presidential nomination, but lost to Franklin Delano Roosevelt.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman', Times, serif">More on Hjalmar Schacht later.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman', Times, serif">In the aftermath of World War I and the impending collapse of the German economy and political structure, a plan was needed to rescue and restore Germany, which would also insulate other economies in Europe from being affected adversely.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman', Times, serif">The Versailles Treaty of 1919 (which officially ended WWI) had imposed a very heavy reparations burden on Germany, which required a repayment schedule of 132 billion gold marks per year. Most historians agree that the economic upheaval caused in Germany by the Versailles Treaty eventually led to Adolph Hitler’s rise to power.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman', Times, serif">In 1924 the Allies appointed a committee of international bankers, led by Charles G. Dawes (and accompanied by J.P. Morgan agent, Owen Young), to develop a plan to get reparations payments back on track. Historian Carroll Quigley noted that the Dawes Plan was “largely a J.P. Morgan production”</span><span style="font-family: Georgia">[1]</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman', Times, serif"> The plan called for $800 million in foreign loans to be arranged for Germany in order to rebuild its economy.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman', Times, serif">In 1924, Dawes was chairman of the Allied Committee of Experts, hence, the “Dawes Plan.” He was replaced as chairman by Owen Young in 1929, with direct support by J.P.

<p align="left"><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman', Times, serif">Neither Dawes nor Young represented anything more than banking interests. After all, WWI was fought by governments using borrowed money made possible by the international banking community. The banks had a vested interest in having those loans repaid!</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman', Times, serif">In 1924, the president of Reichsbank (Germany’s central bank at that time) was Hjalmar Schacht. He had already had a prominent role in creating the Dawes Plan, along with German industrialist Fritz Thyssen and other prominent German bankers and industrialists.</span></p>

It was actually Hjalmar Schacht who first proposed the idea</span><span style="font-family: Georgia">[3]</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman', Times, serif">, which was then carried forward by the same group of international bankers who brought us the Dawes and Young Plans.</span></p>

<p align="left"><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman', Times, serif">So here we have a brief sketch of what led up to the founding of the BIS. Now we can examine the nuts and bolts of how the BIS was actually put together.</span></p>
<h3 align="left"><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman', Times, serif"><b>The Hague Agreement of 1930</b></span></h3>
<div align="center">
<div>
<p align="left"><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman', Times, serif">The formation of the BIS was agreed upon by its constituent central banks in the so-called Hague Agreement on January 20, 1930, and was in operation shortly thereafter. According to the Agreement,</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<div align="center">
<div>
<div align="left">
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman', Times, serif"><i>The duly authorised representatives of the Governments of Germany, of Belgium, of France, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, of Italy and of Japan of the one part; And the duly authorised representatives of the Government of the Swiss Confederation of the other part Assembled at the Hague Conference in the month of January, 1930, have agreed on the following:</i></span></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px" align="left"><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman', Times, serif"><i>Article 1. Switzerland undertakes to grant to the Bank for International Settlements, without delay, the following Constituent Charter having force of law: not to abrogate this Charter, not to amend or add to it, and not to sanction amendments to the Statutes of the Bank referred to in Paragraph 4 of the Charter otherwise than in agreement with the other signatory Governments.</i></span><span style="font-family: Georgia">[5]</span></div>
<div align="center">
<div>
<p align="left"><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman', Times, serif">As we will see, German reparation payments (or lack thereof) had little to do with the founding of the BIS, although this is the weak explanation given since its founding. Of course, Germany would make a single payment to the BIS, which in turn would deposit the funds into the respective central bank accounts of the nations to whom payments were due. (It would be the subject of another paper to show the shallowness of this operation: Money and gold were shuffled around, but the net amount that Germany actually paid was very small.)</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman', Times, serif">The original founding documents of the BIS have little to say about Germany, however, and we can look directly to the BIS itself to see its original purpose:</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<div align="center">
<div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px" align="left"><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman', Times, serif"><i>The objects of the Bank are: to promote the co-operation of central banks and to provide additional facilities for international operations; and to act as trustees or agent in regard to international financial settlements entrusted to it under agreements with the parties concerned.</i></span><span style="font-family: Georgia">[6]</span></div>
</div>
</div>
<div align="center">
<div>
<p align="left"><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman', Times, serif">Virtually every in-print reference to the BIS, including their own documents, consistently refer to it as “the central banker’s central bank.”</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman', Times, serif">So, the BIS was established by an international charter and was headquartered in Basle, Switzerland.</span></p>
<h3 align="left"><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman', Times, serif"><b>BIS Ownership</b></span></h3>
<p align="left"><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman', Times, serif">According to James C. Baker, pro-BIS author of <i>The Bank for International Settlements: Evolution and Evaluation</i>, “The BIS was formed with funding by the central banks of six nations, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom. In addition, three private international banks from the United States also assisted in financing the establishment of the BIS.”</span><span style="font-family: Georgia">[7]</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman', Times, serif">Each nation’s central bank subscribed to 16,000 shares. The U.S. central bank, the Federal Reserve, did not join the BIS, but the three U.S. banks that participated got 16,000 shares each. Thus, U.S. representation at the BIS was three times that of any other nation. Who were these private banks? Not surprisingly, they were J.P. Morgan &amp; Company, First National Bank of New York and First National Bank of Chicago.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman', Times, serif">On January 8, 2001, an Extraordinary General Meeting of the BIS approved a proposal that restricted ownership of BIS shares to central banks. Some 13.7% of all shares were in private hands at that time, and the repurchase was accomplished with a cash outlay of $724,956,050. The price of $10,000 per share was over twice the book value of $4,850.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman', Times, serif">It is not certain what the repurchase accomplished. The BIS claimed that it was to correct a conflict of interest between private shareholders and BIS goals, but it offered no specifics. It was not a voting issue, however, because private owners were not allowed to vote their shares.</span><span style="font-family: Georgia">[8]</span></p>
<h3 align="left"><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman', Times, serif"><b>Sovereignty and Secrecy</b></span></h3>
<p align="left"><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman', Times, serif">It is not surprising that the BIS, its offices, employees, directors and members share an incredible immunity from virtually all regulation, scrutiny and accountability.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman', Times, serif">In 1931, central bankers and their constituents were fed up with government meddling in world financial affairs. Politicians were viewed mostly with contempt, unless it was one of their own who was the politician. Thus, the BIS offered them a once-and-for-all opportunity to set up the “apex” the way they really wanted it — private. They demanded these conditions and got what they demanded.</span></p>

<div>
<p align="left"><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman', Times, serif">Why is “agency” an important issue? Because any member of the network can obscure transactions from onlookers. For instance, if Brown Brothers, Harriman wanted to transfer money to a company in Nazi Germany during WWII (which was not “politically correct” at that time), they would first transfer the funds to the BIS thus putting the transaction under the cloak of secrecy and immunity that is enjoyed by the BIS but not by Brown Brothers, Harriman. (Such laundering of Wall Street money was painstakingly noted in Wall Street and the Rise of Hitler, by Antony C. Sutton.)</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman', Times, serif">There are a few things that the BIS cannot do. For instance, it does not accept deposits from, or provide financial services to, private individuals or corporate entities. It is also not permitted to make advances to governments or open current accounts in their name.</span><span style="font-family: Georgia">[15]</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman', Times, serif"> These restrictions are easily understood when one considers that each central bank has an exclusive franchise to loan money to their respective government. For instance, the U.S. Federal Reserve does not loan money to the government of Canada. In like manner, central banks do not loan money directly to the private or corporate clients of their member banks.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman', Times, serif"><b>How Decisions are Made</b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman', Times, serif">The board of directors consist of the heads of certain member central banks. Currently, these are:</span></p>

<p align="left"><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman', Times, serif">The combined board meets at least six times per year, in secret, and is briefed by BIS management on financial operations of the bank. Global monetary policy is discussed and set at these meetings.</span></p>

<p align="left"><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman', Times, serif">The interoperation between the three entities is understandably confusing to most people, so a little clarification will help.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman', Times, serif">The International Monetary Fund (IMF) interacts with governments whereas the BIS interacts only with other central banks. The IMF loans money to national governments, and often these countries are in some kind of fiscal or monetary crisis. Furthermore, the IMF raises money by receiving “quota” contributions from its 184 member countries. Even though the member countries may borrow money to make their quota contributions, it is, in reality, all tax-payer money.</span><span style="font-family: Georgia">[18]</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman', Times, serif">The World Bank also lends money and has 184 member countries. Within the World Bank are two separate entities, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and the International Development Association (IDA). The IBRD focuses on middle income and credit-worthy poor countries, while the IDA focuses on the poorest of nations. In funding itself, the World Bank borrows money by direct lending from banks and by floating bond issues, and then loans this money through IBRD and IDA to troubled countries.</span><span style="font-family: Georgia">[19]</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman', Times, serif">The BIS, as central bank to the other central banks, facilitates the movement of money. They are well-known for issuing “bridge loans” to central banks in countries where IMF or World Bank money is pledged but has not yet been delivered. These bridge loans are then repaid by the respective governments when they receive the funds that had been promised by the IMF or World Bank.</span><span style="font-family: Georgia">[20]</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman', Times, serif">The IMF is the BIS’ “ace in the hole” when monetary crisis hits. The 1998 Brazil currency crisis was caused by that country’s inability to pay inordinate accumulated interest on loans made over a protracted period of time. These loans were extended by banks like Citigroup, J.P. Morgan Chase and FleetBoston, and they stood to lose a huge amount of money.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman', Times, serif">The IMF, along with the World Bank and the U.S., bailed out Brazil with a $41.5 billion package that saved Brazil, its currency and, not incidentally, certain private banks.</span></p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px"><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman', Times, serif"><i>BURLINGTON, VERMONT – August 15 – Congressman Bernard Sanders (I-VT), the Ranking Member of the International Monetary Policy and Trade Subcommittee, today called for an immediate Congressional investigation of the recent $30 billion International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout of Brazil.</i></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><i style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman', Times, serif">Sanders, who is strongly opposed to the bailout and considers it corporate welfare, wants Congress to find out why U.S. taxpayers are being asked to provide billions of dollars to Brazil and how <b>much of this money will be funneled to U.S. banks such as Citigroup, FleetBoston and J.P. Morgan Chase.</b> These banks have about $25.6 billion in outstanding loans to Brazilian borrowers. <b>U.S. taxpayers currently fund the IMF through a $37 billion line of credit.</b></i></p>

</div>
<div align="center">
<div>
<div align="left">
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman', Times, serif"><i>Sanders said, “At a time when we have a $6 trillion national debt, a growing federal deficit, and an increasing number of unmet social needs for our veterans, seniors, and children, it is unacceptable that billions of U.S. taxpayer dollars are being sent to the IMF to bailout Brazil.”</i></span></p>

</div>
</div>
<div align="center">
<div>
<div align="left">
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman', Times, serif"><i>“This money is not going to significantly help the poor people of that country. <b>The real winners in this situation are the large, profitable U.S. banks such as Citigroup that have made billions of dollars in risky investments in Brazil and now want to make sure their investments are repaid.</b> This bailout represents an egregious form of corporate welfare that must be put to an end. Interestingly, these banks have made substantial campaign contributions to both political parties,” the Congressman added.</i></span></p>

</div>
</div>
<div align="center">
<div>
<div align="left">
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman', Times, serif"><i>Sanders noted that the neo-liberal policies of the IMF developed in the 1980’s pushing countries towards unfettered free trade, privatization, and slashing social safety nets has been a disaster for Latin America and has contributed to increased global poverty throughout the world. At the same time that Latin America countries such as Brazil and Argentina followed these neo-liberal dictates imposed by the IMF, from 1980-2000, per capita income in Latin America grew at only one-tenth the rate of the previous two decades.</i></span></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px" align="left"><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman', Times, serif"><i>Sanders continued, <b>“The policies of the IMF over the past 20 years advocating unfettered free trade, privatizing industry, deregulation and slashing government investments in health, education, and pensions has been a complete failure for low income and middle class families in the developing world and in the United States .</b>Clearly, these policies have only helped corporations in their constant search for the cheapest labor and weakest environmental regulations. Congress must work on a new global policy that protects workers, increases living standards and improves the environment.”</i></span></div>
<div align="left"></div>
<div align="left"><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman', Times, serif">One can surmise that a financial circle exists where the World Bank helps nations get into debt, then when these countries can’t pay their massive loans, the IMF bails them out with taxpayer money — and in the middle stands the BIS, collecting fees as the money travels back and forth like the ocean tide, while assuring everyone that all is well.</span></div>

<p align="left"><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman', Times, serif"><b>BIS dumps gold-backed Swiss Francs for SDR’s</b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman', Times, serif">On March 10, 2003, the BIS abandoned the Swiss gold franc as the bank’s unit of account since 1930, and replaced it with the SDR.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman', Times, serif">SDR stands for Special Drawing Rights and is a unit of currency originally created by the IMF. According to Baker,</span></p>
</div>
<div align="center">
<div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px" align="left"><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman', Times, serif"><i>“The SDR is an international reserve asset, created by the IMF in 1969 to supplement the existing official reserves of member countries. SDR’s are allocated to member countries in proportion to their IMF quotas. The SDR also serves as the unit of account of the IMF and some other international organizations. Its value is based on a basket of key international currencies.”</i></span><span style="font-family: Georgia">[21]</span></div>
</div>
</div>
<div align="center">
<div>
<p align="left"><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman', Times, serif">This “basket” currently consists of the euro, Japanese yen, pound sterling and the U.S. dollar.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman', Times, serif">The BIS abandonment of the 1930 gold Swiss franc removed all restraint from the creation of paper money in the world. In other words, gold backs no national currency, leaving the central banks a wide-open field to create money as they alone see fit. Remember, that almost all the central banks in the world are privately-held entities, with an exclusive franchise to arrange loans for their respective host countries.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman', Times, serif"><b>Regional and Global Currencies: SDR’s, Euros and Ameros</b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman', Times, serif">There is no doubt that the BIS is moving the world toward regional currencies and ultimately, a global currency. The global currency could well be an evolution of the SDR, and may explain why the BIS recently adopted the SDR as its primary reserve currency.</span></p>

<div>
<p align="left"><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman', Times, serif">As to regional currencies, the BIS has already been hugely successful in launching the euro in Europe. Armed with new technical and social know-how, the BIS’ next logical step is to focus on America and Asia.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman', Times, serif">For instance, according to BIS Papers No. 17, Regional currency areas and the use of foreign currencies,</span></p>

<div align="center">
<div>
<p align="left"><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman', Times, serif">Assuming that NAFTA permanently identifies Canada, the U.S. and Mexico as one trading block, then North America will look like the European Union and the Amero will function like the Euro. All of the work put into the SDR would be perfectly preserved by simply substituting the Amero for the U.S. dollar when they choose to bring the Amero to ascendancy over the dollar.</span></p>

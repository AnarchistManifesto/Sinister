<b><a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2013/10/the-coming-food-stamp-riots.html">Activist Post</a></b></p>
<p>It may not happen this month, or even this year, but food stamp riots  are coming to America.  In fact, we got a small preview of the coming  food stamp riots this past weekend when a “temporary system failure”  caused food stamp cards to stop working in 17 U.S. states.  Within  hours, there were “mini-riots” at Wal-Marts and other retailers that  rely heavily on food stamp users.  So what would happen if food stamp  benefits were cut off or reduced for an extended period of time?</p>
<p>As you  will see below, if Congress had not pushed through a “deal”, the USDA  would have started cutting off food stamp benefits on November 1st.   Considering the fact that 47 million Americans are on food stamps and  more than 100 million Americans are enrolled in at least one welfare  program run by the federal government, that could have sparked massive  rioting.  So the good news is that the coming food stamp riots will  probably not happen in November.  The bad news is that the “deal” in  Congress only delays the political fighting until after Christmas.  In  just a few months we will be dealing with a potential “government  shutdown” and a debt ceiling deadline once again.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>Most Americans have no idea what almost just happened.  According <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/10/16/us-usa-fiscal-northcarolina-idUSBRE99F00Y20131016" target="_blank" title="to Reuters">to Reuters</a>, the state of North Carolina had already cut off some welfare benefits for the month of November…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>North Carolina has become the first state to cut off  welfare benefits to poor residents in the wake of the partial federal  government shutdown, ordering a halt to processing November applications  until a deal is reached to end the federal standstill. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>More than 20,000 people – most of them children – receive monthly  benefits aimed at helping them buy food and other basic supplies through  North Carolina’s welfare program, called Work First, which is fully  funded by the federal government. Recipients must reapply each month.</p>

And as <a href="http://www.shtfplan.com/headline-news/alert-government-freezes-ebt-funds-orders-states-to-withhold-transfers-to-food-stamp-recipients_10152013" target="_blank" title="Mac Slavo">Mac Slavo</a> recently detailed, the USDA was already planning to cut off food stamp assistance to millions of Americans on November 1st…</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>We say next month because the USDA, which  oversees the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP), has  just issued an order to SNAP agency directors calling for their  respective States to implement an emergency contingency program because  of government funding issues. In a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151656956002691&amp;set=a.107446732690.104974.44317167690&amp;type=1&amp;theater" target="_blank" title="letter obtained by the Crossroads Urban Center">letter obtained by the Crossroads Urban Center</a>  food pantry, the USDA is directing state agencies to, “delay their  November issuance files and delay transmission to State Electronic  Benefit Transfer (EBT) vendors until further notice.”</b> </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What this means is that should Congress fail to increase the debt  ceiling this week, come November there will literally be millions of  people in the United States who will have exactly zero dollars  transferred to their EBT cards. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What will happen to the nearly 50 million people who depend on these benefits to survive?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In fact, there have been quite a few news reports <a href="http://rt.com/usa/food-stamps-funding-shutdown-244/" target="_blank" title="that have confirmed this">that have confirmed this</a>…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Utah, Fox News 13 in Salt Lake City reported that a  local provider recently received a letter from the USDA sticking to the  November 1 cut-off date. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><i>“This is going to create a huge hardship for the people we serve here in our food pantry,”</i> Bill Tibbits, Associate Director at Crossroads Urban Center, told Fox News 13. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><i>“What this means [is] if there’s not a deal, if Congress doesn’t  reach a deal to get federal government back up and running, in Utah  about 100,000 families won’t get food stamp benefit,”</i> added Tibbits. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The USDA letter says in part, <i>“in the interest of preserving  maximum flexibility, we are directing states to hold their November  issuance files and delay transmission to state electronic benefit  transfer vendors until further notice.”</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So what would have happened if tens of millions of Americans suddenly had their food stamp benefits cut off without warning?</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/familysurvival.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 0em;margin-left: 1em"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-CfIj9EYbDxo/T_Nf0wxBwAI/AAAAAAAAQUo/-MBQzMiRIEw/s241/160.gif" alt=""></a>Well, what happened last weekend can give us a few clues.  Just check out what happened at one Wal-Mart <a href="http://www.clarionledger.com/article/20131014/NEWS01/310140019/EBT-outage-prompts-disturbance-theft-Philadelphia-Walmart?nclick_check=1" target="_blank" title="in Mississippi">in Mississippi</a>…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Customers staged a disturbance then walked out of a  Mississippi Walmart store with groceries that hadn’t been paid for  Saturday night after a computer glitch left them unable to use their  food stamp cards. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>People in 17 states found themselves unable to buy groceries with  their Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program cards after a routine  check by vendor Xerox Corp. resulted in a temporary system failure. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Shortly after the mini-riot, managers decided to temporarily close the store, citing customer safety.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Due to this technical glitch, many parents were left <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-0xJb_FM4" target="_blank" title="wondering how they were going to feed their families">wondering how they were going to feed their families</a>.   If this is the kind of anger that is unleashed over a single failed  trip to the grocery store, what would we see if this kind of thing went  on for an extended period of time?</p>

<p>Shelves in Walmart stores in Springhill and Mansfield, LA  were reportedly cleared Saturday night, when the stores allowed  purchases on EBT cards even though they were not showing limits. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The chaos that followed ultimately required intervention from local  police, and left behind numerous carts filled to overflowing, apparently  abandoned when the glitch-spurred shopping frenzy ended. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Springhill Police Chief Will Lynd confirms they were called in to  help the employees at Walmart because there were so many people clearing  off the shelves. He says Walmart was so packed, “It was worse than any  black Friday” that he’s ever seen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sadly, this was only a very small preview of the massive food stamp riots that are eventually coming to America.  I like how <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/042479_EBT_cards_Walmart_looting.html" target="_blank" title="Mike Adams">Mike Adams</a> explained what we are likely to see in the future…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why does any of this matter? Because <b>this is exactly the same way these people will behave when the federal government goes into default</b> and nearly 50 million EBT cards stop working nationwide. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Fifty million. Consider that for a moment. Most of those 50 million  people live in high-density cities. Many are proud owners of Obama  phones, Obama food stamps, Obama unemployment checks and Obama  subsidized housing. They have absolutely no clue that the government  upon which they wholly depend to put food on the table is teetering on  the verge of permanent collapse. (Seriously, they cannot conceive of the  idea of government “running out of money” because they do not  understand where money comes from.) Because of this distorted belief,  they do not prepare for any future events other than more Obama  handouts. Their entire “preparedness” plan is to vote for Democrats,  because that’s who they know will give them the most handouts. And they  will always win the popular vote, too, because any politician promising  to restore responsible fiscal spending to the government by cutting  programs will be viciously accused of being “mean” or involved in  “hating poor people.” So the government handouts will only ratchet  higher and higher, ensnaring more and more people, until the entire  system is unsustainable and collapses under its own weight. </p>

As proof of this, consider the fact that this mass  looting of Wal-Mart stores happened in <b>less than three hours</b>  after the Saturday EBT card glitch struck. Police had to be called in to  prevent the situation from getting completely out of control, and it  was offline for only part of one day. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Now imagine what will happen when EBT cards go offline for 24, 48 or  even 72 hours. And imagine it happening in every U.S. city  simultaneously.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course not all Americans would go wild when food stamp benefits are cut off.</p>
<p>Other Americans express their desperation in other ways.  According to <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-10-15/bodies-double-as-cash-machines-with-u-s-income-lagging-economy.html" target="_blank" title="Bloomberg">Bloomberg</a>,  an increasing number of people are starting to sell hair, breast milk  and their own eggs in a desperate attempt to make ends meet…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hair, breast milk and eggs are doubling as automated teller machines for some cash-strapped Americans such as April Hare. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Out of work for more than two years and facing eviction from her  home, Hare recalled Louisa May Alcott’s 19th-century novel and took to  her computer. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“I was just trying to find ways to make money, and I remembered Jo  from ‘Little Women,’ and she sold her hair,” the 35-year-old from  Atlanta said. “I’ve always had lots of hair, but this is the first time  I’ve actually had the idea to sell it because I’m in a really tight jam  right now.” </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The mother of two posted pictures of her 18-inch <a href="http://buyandsellhair.com/ads/thick-strong-and-natural-auburn-hair-2-heads-worth-of-hair/" rel="external" target="_blank" title="Open Web Site">auburn</a> mane on <a href="http://buyandsellhair.com/" rel="external" target="_blank" title="Open Web Site">www.buyandsellhair.com</a>,  asking at least $1,000 and receiving responses within hours. Hare, who  also considered selling her breast milk, joins others exploring  unconventional ways to make ends meet as the four-year-old economic  expansion struggles to invigorate the labor market and stimulate  incomes.</p>

</div>
<p>We have moved into a time when things are becoming increasingly unstable and when people are becoming increasingly desperate.</p>
<p>In an attempt to keep order, the authorities will become increasingly  forceful in the years ahead.  At this point, many law enforcement  officers already believe that there is very little that they cannot do  to exert their “authority” over the rest of us.  Just check out video of  a drunk off-duty police officer “arresting” a woman that refused to go  out on a date with him <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkhrWZ6twjw" target="_blank" title="right here">right here</a>.  Sadly, this type of behavior is becoming way too common these days.</p>
<p>And it looks like major financial institutions are getting ready for  the chaos that is eventually coming as well.  In fact, according to an  article <a href="http://www.infowars.com/chase-bank-limits-cash-withdrawals-bans-international-wire-transfers/" target="_blank" title="by Paul Joseph Watson">by Paul Joseph Watson</a>,  Chase Bank is now placing a limit on cash withdrawals and is banning  business customers from sending wire transfers out of the country…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Chase Bank has moved to limit cash withdrawals while  banning business customers from sending international wire transfers  from November 17 onwards, prompting speculation that the bank is  preparing for a looming financial crisis in the United States by  imposing capital controls. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Numerous business customers with Chase BusinessSelect Checking and  Chase BusinessClassic accounts have received letters over the past week  informing them that cash activity (both deposits and withdrawals) will  be limited to a $50,000 total per statement cycle from November 17  onwards.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>F<a href="http://activistpost.net/foodcrisis.html" rel="nofollow" style="float: right;margin-left: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-AZzgc806w9s/TtEamGAkBbI/AAAAAAAAM2Y/GN5ff31ySP4/s200/imgad.jpg"></a>ortunately, the chaos that would have been unleashed if Congress had not made a deal has now been delayed for a few months.</p>
<p>But by kicking the can down the road, our politicians continue to  make our long-term problems even worse.  Either we are going to have  tremendous pain now, or we are going to have even worse pain later.  <a href="http://news.goldseek.com/EuroCapital/1381501020.php" target="_blank" title="Peter Schiff">Peter Schiff</a> explained the choice that we are facing this way…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If Republicans were to inexplicably prevail, and the  federal government were to cut spending so that its expenditures matched  its tax revenues (a truly radical idea) the country’s financial mess  would be laid bare. The government would have to weigh the relative  costs and benefits of making interest payments on Treasury debt  (primarily to foreign creditors) or to trim entitlements promised to  U.S. citizens. But those are choices we will have to make sooner or  later anyway. In fact we should have dealt with these issues years ago.  But generations of mechanistic debt ceiling increases have allowed us to  perpetually kick the can down the road. What could possibly be gained  by doing it again, particularly if it is done with no commitment to  change course? </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The Democrats’ argument that America needs to pay its bills is just  hollow rhetoric. Paying off one’s Visa bill with a new and bigger  MasterCard bill can’t be considered a legitimate payment of debt. At  best it is a transfer. But in the government’s case, it doesn’t even  qualify as that. Treasury debt is primarily bought by the Fed, foreign  central banks, and major financial institutions. None of that will  change with a debt ceiling increase. We will just go to the same people  for greater quantities. So it’s like paying off your Visa card with a  bigger Visa card.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are living on borrowed time that has been purchased by stealing money from future generations.<br />
We are literally destroying the future in order to make the present more palatable.</p>
<p>But whether it is this year, or next year or the year after that, at  some point we are going to experience the pain that results from decades  of incredibly foolish decisions.</p>
<p>I hope that you are getting ready.</p>

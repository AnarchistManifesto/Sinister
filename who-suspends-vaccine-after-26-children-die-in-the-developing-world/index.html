<p>According to reports, at least 26 children have died and many more have been seriously injured after they were given the 5 in 1 vaccine, Quinvaxem. [1] Newspapers have reported that all of the victims suffered adverse reactions including fevers, vomiting and the appearance of bruises all over their bodies. [2]</p>
<p>Quinvaxem, being offered at no cost to recipients by UNICEF, is a pre-qualified vaccine on trial in developing countries. Currently being given to babies as young as eight weeks of age, this pentavalent vaccine is said to protect infants and young children against diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, hepatitis B, and Hib (haemophilus influenzae type b).</p>
<p>According to reports, local authorities have suspended all the controversial batches for testing. However, the Health Ministry said there are no problems with the vaccine’s quality, distribution, preservation or administration. [3]</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>Although deaths have been reported from Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Bhutan and India, the World Health Organization (WHO) has stood by the safety of Quinvaxem, stating that all their studies of the vaccine, made in South Korea, affirm its safety!</p>

<b>Children Being Used as Guinea Pigs</b>Once again, here is another example of children dying and many others suffering horrific side effects from a vaccine being tested on vulnerable children in developing countries. Isn’t it about time the WHO stopped pretending that they are in the business of protecting children and admitted to the fact they are instead part of a world depopulation program?</p>
<p>I urge readers to read a paper written by Dr. Rebecca Carley titled “Inoculations: The True Weapons of Mass Destructions Causing VIDS” (Vaccine-Induced Diseases) (An Epidemic of Genocide) in which she states:</p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>In fact, the ‘prevention’ of a disease via vaccination is, in reality, an inability to expel organisms due to the suppression of the cell-mediated response. Thus, rather than preventing disease, the disease is actually prevented from ever being resolved. [4]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She saw all these atrocities coming before many others and has been desperately trying to warn the public, ever since.</p>
<p><a style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em" href="http://activistpost.net/vaccinetruth.html" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-38G3VOJQToQ/TfAZ2bc-qRI/AAAAAAAAJQ8/LA-TGAvVeWk/250x250-b.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="175"></a><b>Possible Kawasaki Disease</b></p>
<p>It is quite possible that many of these children have suffered an autoimmune response after being vaccinated with this vaccine. I back up this opinion with a variety of articles and papers on Kawasaki disease.</p>
<p>Kawasaki disease is an autoimmune disorder that can occur after a vaccination. In fact, scientists who have studied the illness in depth say that evidence strongly suggests that an infectious agent, such as a virus or a vaccine, causes the illness. [5]</p>
<p>Children suffering from Kawasaki disease suffer symptoms very similar to those suffered by the children vaccinated with Quinvaxem. I have linked this disorder to the children vaccinated with Quinvaxem because the disease can cause children to suffer from the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>red, bloodshot eyes caused by conjunctivitis, but with no pus</li>
<li>a blotchy, red rash mainly on the trunk of your child’s body or on the genitals</li>
<li>reddened, dry or cracked lips</li>
<li>a red, inflamed tongue with circular white patches that look like a strawberry, often with a red sore throat</li>
<li>large swollen lumps (lymph glands) on either side of your child’s neck</li>
<li>swollen hands and feet which become red and hard, often resulting in peeling skin on the fingertips and toes two to three weeks after the disease has started</li>
<li>sore throat</li>
<li>cough</li>
<li>sore abdomen (tummy)</li>
<li>vomiting</li>
<li>diarrhea</li>
<li>painful or swollen joints</li>
</ul>
<p>Many children can go on to die of heart failure or heart attack. Kawasaki disease is said to be the most common cause of acquired heart disease in children in the UK and the USA. [6]</p>
<p>In a paper written by P.A. Brogan et al. titled “Kawasaki disease: an evidence based approach to diagnosis, treatment, and proposals for future research,” the authors state:</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>In 1967 Tomisaku Kawasaki described 50 Japanese children with an illness characterized by fever, rash, conjunctival injection, erythema and swelling of hands and feet, and cervical lymphadenopathy … KD is commonest in Japan where more than 125 000 cases have been reported. The disease is also commoner in Japanese and other Oriental children living abroad. Children aged 6 months to 5 years are most susceptible, with peak incidence in children aged 9–11 months. Seasonal variation in the disease incidence has been reported, with peak occurrence in the winter and spring months. Direct person to person spread is not observed, although in Japan the disease occurs more commonly in siblings of index cases with an estimated peak incidence of 8–9% in siblings under the age of 2 years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, the authors do mention vaccination as a possible trigger:</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p> … Irritability is an important sign, which is virtually universally present, although not included as one of the diagnostic criteria. The exact mechanism of the irritability is unclear, but it may be related to the presence of aseptic meningitis. Another clinical sign not incorporated into the diagnostic criteria, but which is relatively specific to KD, is the development of erythema and induration <b>at sites of BCG immunisations</b>. The mechanism of this clinical sign is cross reactivity of T cells in KD patients between specific epitopes of mycobacterial and human heat shock proteins. <b>With an increasing number of infants receiving the BCG in the UK, it is likely that this sign will become more common</b>, and awareness of it could result in earlier diagnosis and treatment. (emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you read the above statements carefully, you may recognize that the ages of children at highest risk of contracting the disease are the precise age at which they receive the highest number of vaccines.</p>
<p>Dr. Michael Innis often refers to the disease in suspected child abuse cases, saying that the marks and bruising seen in cases of Kawasaki disease are often mistaken for child abuse. [7]</p>
<p>Three researchers who wrote a paper titled “Kawasaki disease in an infant following immunization,” published by the National Institutes of Health, stated in their abstract:</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>We here describe a 35 day-old infant who developed Kawasaki disease 1 day after receiving his second dose of hepatitis B vaccine. Although extremely rare, this possible side effect should be noted and further investigated. [8]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This paper was written in 2003, so, why isn’t the link between vaccination and KD being thoroughly investigated?</p>
<p><a style="clear: right;float: right;margin-left: 1em;margin-top: -1em" href="http://activistpost.net/vaccineexempt.html" rel="nofollow"><img class="noshadow" style="border: none" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-ndvYUapEn5A/TpHdZPRyqyI/AAAAAAAALS0/rUkfbJmy3o0/s240/vaccinexempt2.jpg" alt=""></a>Another paper titled “Kawasaki disease after vaccination: reports to the vaccine adverse event reporting system 1990-2007,” stated:</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>Through October 14, 2007, 107 KD reports were received by VAERS: 26 were categorized as classic cases, 19 atypical, 52 possible, and 10 were noncases. Of the 97 cases, 91% were children. [9]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although the authors concluded that their review did not suggest an elevated KD risk for RotaTeq or other vaccines, they suggested the continued post-marketing monitoring for KD was ongoing.</p>
<p>All of these papers suggest that continuous multiple vaccinations may possibly heighten the risk of young children developing this disease. I have only offered a selection of many papers for readers to study.</p>
<p>One of the most memorable reminders that KD can and does occur after vaccinations was written by Lisa Blakemore-Brown in a response to the Finnish study about the safety of MMR vaccine on the British Medical Journal in 2001. She wrote:</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>If a group of people collapse after eating, say, lemon sole,in a particular restaurant, it would be ludicrous for those responsible to wave a hand over the problem saying that millions of people eat Lemon Sole every day and there are no problems. Health and safety officials will get straight to the point of the issue and look at the fish in the restaurant, look at the individuals, test findings in the lab.</p>

<p>As hundreds of parents have found their children to react to vaccine, in some cases leading to the ‘new variant autism’ of loss of communication skills, motor impairments and bowel problems, is it not these cases the government should be looking at for answers?</p>

<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>The incidence of this particular tapestry of autism is indisputable. This is not related to increased recognition of autism, The TYPE is unusual and baffling to education and health professionals. In one of my cases of very obvious and indisputable reaction to pertussis vaccine the child in question has been found to have Kawasaki disease, her own immune system attacking itself. She presents as Asperger. There is no autism in the family, but the baby had allergies prior to the vaccine. It is scientific examination of cases like this which will enable us to ultimately put measures in place to reassure the public.</p>

<p>I have chosen to include her excellent contribution because it really does have some very strong and firm advice for organizations such as UNICEF who offer vaccinations to vulnerable children like sweets.</p>
<p>Like Dr. Carley, Ms. Blakemore-Brown’s work has also been discredited. You have to wonder why, don’t you? Both of them are talented, gifted professionals, sharing similar concerns across opposite sides of the world, along with hundreds of others professionals saying exactly the same statements, many of whom in recent years have become targets of vicious hate campaigns, before having their careers sabotaged.</p>
<div>
<b>Conclusion</b>It has become second nature for the likes of WHO and UNICEF to offer free trial and banned vaccinations to the poor and vulnerable populations in the developing world. These are God’s children, too, and they are very precious. They are not lab rats or guinea pigs to be tested at leisure. They are like any other children; they have brothers, sisters, mothers, fathers, aunts, uncles and grandparents who love them dearly.</p>
<p>Their innocent parents believe the propaganda being fed to them by the likes of UNICEF. They believe that these vaccines are safe and will protect their precious babies. Instead, their children are dying the most horrific deaths after being given pre-qualified vaccines.</p>
<p>Lisa Blakemore-Brown was right when she said, “Blanket refusal to look at the real issues and prevention of individuals exercising choice seems a dangerous policy.” Isn’t it about time to look at the real issues surrounding vaccination and stop testing innocent and vulnerable communities with pre-qualified vaccines which are unfit for any purpose?</p>

<p><i>Christina was born and educated in London, U.K. She left school to work in a children’s library, specializing in story telling and book buying. In 1978 Christina changed her career path to dedicate her time to caring for the elderly and was awarded the title of Care Giver of the Year for her work with the elderly in 1980. In1990 she adopted the first of two disabled boys, both with challenging behavior, complex disabilities and medical needs. In 1999 she was accused of Munchausen by Proxy after many failed attempts to get the boys’ complex needs met. Finally, she was cleared of all accusations after the independent psychologist Lisa Blakemore-Brown gave both boys the diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder and ADHD as part of what she described to be a complex tapestry of disorders. During the assessments Ms Blakemore-Brown discovered through the foster care diaries that the eldest boy had reacted adversely to the MMR vaccine. After taking an A Level in Psychology and a BTEC in Learning Disabilities Ms. England spent many years researching vaccines and adverse reactions. She went on to gain a Higher National Diploma in journalism and media and currently writes for the American Chronicle, the Weekly Blitz, VacTruth and Namaste Publishing UK on immunization safety and efficacy whilst continuing to study for a BA Honors degree in English Literature and Humanities. England’s main areas of expertise are researching false allegations of child abuse and adverse reactions to vaccines. Her work is read internationally and has been translated into many languages. Ms England has been a guest on many radio shows and has spoken at seminars worldwide. She is the co author to the book </i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Syndrome-Vaccine-Induced-Encephalitis-ebook/dp/B004OEKDMS/ref=sr_1_fkmr1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1355752412&amp;sr=8-2-fkmr1&amp;keywords=%C2%91Shaken+Baby+Syndrome+or+Vaccine+Induced+Encephalitis+%C2%96+Are+Parents+Being+Falsely+Accused%3F%C2%92"><i>‘</i><b>Shaken Baby Syndrome or Vaccine Induced Encephalitis – Are Parents Being Falsely Accused?’</b></a><i> with Dr Harold Buttram.</i></p>

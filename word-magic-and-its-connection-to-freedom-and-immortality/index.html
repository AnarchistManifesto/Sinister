<p><span style="font-size: x-large">Word magic is the art of using word play, definition and magic (magick) to transfer or hide information. All words have magic power because they were created based on sacred sound and sacred geometry, allowing them to direct and control energy to produce certain desired effects. </span></p>
<p>Is this hard for you to believe?</p>

<a name="more"></a>Remember when your mother and father used to tell you to &#8220;stop cursing&#8221; when you screamed swear words at people?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, your parents most likely did not know the occult meaning behind the term &#8220;stop cursing&#8221;. To &#8220;curse&#8221; at people is to cast &#8220;spells&#8221; on them. Why do you think the act of writing words is called SPELLing?</p>
<p>One of the most powerful word magic spells ever created by mankind is the Name Spell. The Name Spell is one of the most powerful spells for deceiving and controlling you, which is why it is so effective for tricking you to believe that you and your name are one and the same. Your name is made up of letters which are symbols that represent ideas or objects. </p>
<p>Because of this, your name is not living and breathing. On the other hand, you (the living man or woman) are breathing and made of flesh and blood. As a result of that, you and your name are NOT one and the same.</p>
<p>The simple explanation above shows you how the power of word magic can easily trick you to live in an artificial reality. Once you innerstand that you and your name are different, you should feel the Name Spell slowly losing its effect on you, causing you to wake up and remember who you truly are. Keep in mind that word magic can be used for &#8220;good&#8221; or &#8220;evil&#8221; purposes.</p>
<p>Before we explore how word magic is used to trick the mind, let us turn our attention to the concept of freedom. In the late 1700s, freedom was a very important and popular topic on people&#8217;s minds, especially on the minds of the people residing in the 13 colonies. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, that passion of freedom did not last long, allowing certain greedy men and women to diminish freedom throughout the world. Today, the passion of freedom is burning strong again, causing many people to be interested in freedom.</p>
<p>This is a wonderful thing, however, when people do not innerstand what freedom is, it can lead them down a dangerous path. To innerstand what freedom is on a deeper level, you have to investigate the word freedom meticulously by studying its origins and different definitions. </p>
<p>Furthermore, you need to investigate certain words that have a strong connection to freedom, such as liberty. You also need to study how word magic is used to hide the deeper meaning of words, allowing you to see their hidden meaning.</p>
<p>When reading this article, please keep in mind that it is essential that you study the important words herein thoroughly and read and study their definitions meticulously. Doing these things will make it easier for you to innerstand the information in this article. </p>
<p>I know that reading and studying the definitions of words can be very dull, boring and confusing, but be aware that these reactions are exactly what the <a href="http://humansarefree.com/2015/08/illuminati-satanists-rule-world-not.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Elite or Dark Magicians</a> want.</p>
<p>Making something dull, boring and confusing is their way of preventing people from investigating it, making it easier for them to hide the truth in plain sight. That being said, let us investigate the word freedom.</p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="color: blue"><span style="font-size: x-large">The Origin and Definition of Freedom</span></span></p>
<p>One of the origins of the word <a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/freedom" target="_blank">freedom</a> is the Old English word freodom, meaning &#8220;power of self-determination, state of free will; emancipation from slavery, deliverance&#8221;. Dictionary.com defines the word <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/browse/freedom" target="_blank">freedom</a> using these exact words:</p>
<p>the state of being free or at liberty rather than in confinement or under physical restraint: He won his freedom after a retrial.<br />exemption from external control, interference, regulation, etc.<br />the power to determine action without restraint.<br />political or national independence.</p>
<p>Black&#8217;s Law Dictionary (5th edition) defines the word freedom using these exact words:</p>
<p>The state of being free; liberty; self-determination; absence of restraint; the opposite of slavery.</p>
<p>The power of acting, in the character of a moral personality, according to the dictates of the will, without other check, hindrance, or prohibition than such as may be imposed by just and necessary laws and the duties of social life.</p>
<p>According to Webster&#8217;s Complete Dictionary of the English Language (1886), the word freedom means &#8220;the state of being free; exemption from the power and control of another; liberty; independence; frankness; openness; liberality; separation; unrestrictedness.&#8221; </p>
<p>Based on the definition in this paragraph and all the previous definitions, the word freedom strongly expresses &#8220;the state of being free from the power and control of another.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here is an excerpt from <a href="https://naturallawmatters.com/2017/11/liberty-or-freedom/" target="_blank">NaturalLawMatters.com</a> that explains what freedom is in more detail:</p>
<p>In vibrant contrast to &#8216;liberty,&#8217; &#8216;freedom&#8217; does not connote a social position or status. Freedom is not a legal concept. Its origins belong to the field of natural law studies, specifically those concerning order and disorder in person-to-person or convivial relations. </p>
<p>The aforementioned differs widely from order and disorder in social structures or organisations where individuals are occupants of socially defined positions.</p>
<p>Freedom derives from its etymological roots in the word &#8216;free&#8217;, an old Indian word &#8216;priya,&#8217; meaning friend. Its Latin forms included &#8216;privus&#8217; meaning exceptional or standing apart. </p>
<p>Altogether these meanings in proper context refer to someone or something having no burdens of any type; no external imposed obligations or interferences. Freedom defines a state in which one is capable of doing according to his or her wishes without any external obligations.</p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><span style="font-size: x-large">What is Liberty?</span></span></p>
<p>A word that has a strong connection to freedom is liberty. The word <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/browse/liberty" target="_blank">liberty</a> is defined by Dictionary.com using these exact words:</p>
<ul>
<li>freedom from arbitrary or despotic government or control.
</li>
<li>freedom from external or foreign rule; independence.
</li>
<li>freedom from control, interference, obligation, restriction, hampering conditions, etc.; power or right of doing, thinking, speaking, etc., according to choice.
</li>
<li>permission granted to a sailor, especially in the navy, to go ashore.</li>
</ul>
<p>Black&#8217;s Law Dictionary (5th edition) defines the word liberty using these exact words:</p>
<p>Freedom; exemption from extraneous control. Freedom from all restraints except such as are justly imposed by law. </p>
<p>Freedom from restraint, under conditions essential to the equal enjoyment of the same right by others; freedom regulated by law. The absence of arbitrary restraint, not immunity from reasonable regulations and prohibitions imposed in the interests of the community.</p>
<p>It is interesting to know that in Black&#8217;s Law Dictionary (5th edition), three short paragraphs are used to define the word Freedom, taking up less than 20 percent of the page. As for the word liberty, over 10 paragraphs are used to define it, taking up more than one page. </p>
<p>When you study the definitions of freedom and liberty in Black&#8217;s Law Dictionary (5th edition) deeply enough, you may notice that the word liberty has many definitions and a strong connection to artificial laws. </p>
<p>When a word has many definitions, it can easily be used to trick you to agree to give up your natural rights to the State. This art of using words and definitions to trick you to do something is known as word magic.</p>
<p>In one of the Dictionary.com definitions of liberty, it says &#8220;permission granted to a sailor, especially in the navy, to go ashore.&#8221; A sailor is defined by Black&#8217;s Law Dictionary (5th edition) as &#8220;seamen; mariners.&#8221; The word seamen is defined by the same law dictionary using these exact words:</p>
<p>Sailors; mariners; persons whose business is navigating ships, or who are connected with the ship as such and in some capacity assist in its conduct, maintenance or service. [&#8230;] One whose occupation is to navigate vessels upon the sea including all those on board whose labor contributes to the accomplishment of the main object in which the vessel is engaged.</p>
<p>The word liberty has a strong connection to the <a href="http://humansarefree.com/2014/04/the-secret-worship-of-illuminati-statue.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ancient Roman goddess Libertas</a>. In fact, the word for liberty in Latin is Libertas. Dictionary.com <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/browse/libertas" target="_blank">defines Libertas</a> as, &#8220;the ancient Roman personification of liberty&#8221;. </p>
<p>In Roman mythology, the name Libertas was used to identify the goddess of freedom. This goddess was the female personification of liberty and personal freedom. Libertas was the Roman version of the ancient Egyptian goddess Isis. This Egyptian goddess was sometimes called the goddess of marriage and protector of sailors at sea.  In other words, she was the protector of sailors/seamen.</p>
<p>Below is an excerpt from <a href="https://naturallawmatters.com/2017/11/liberty-or-freedom/" target="_blank">NaturalLawMatters.com</a> that describes liberty in more details:</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large"><i>From the etymological source, &#8216;liberty&#8217; denotes the legal status of a full member in a tribe or society. Membership may be an inherited status, alternatively one that is acquired through adoption or as an official favour. </p>
<p>The word liberty is from the Latin word &#8216;libertas,&#8217; which means a &#8216;descendent,&#8217; being one who enjoys the same social position enjoyed by their predecessors. In todays political society, it typically is an attribute of citizenship, which is a construction of government. Liberty refers to permissions shared by people of a community or a state as they apply to its government.</p>
<p>In general, liberty is a fundamental attribute that provides one the ability to do what he or she wants. The real issue is, who exactly is to provide this attribute. It surely is not a natural gift, a natural right to do as one wants. </p>
<p>For any given government controlled society it is necessary to examine its legal codes to ascertain the extent of one’s liberty. Liberty in one society may be very different from that in another.</i></span></p>

<p>Below are some examples of how word magic is used to hide certain important information in plain sight. These examples will show you the connection between word magic, freedom, immortality and Christmas. </p>
<p>It will also reveal the true meaning of Christmas and why most people have been tricked by &#8220;Santa&#8221; to think that Christmas is something outside of them. We will start exploring the Christmas story by separating the word freedom and investigating it.</p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>When we separate the word freedom into two words, it transforms into the words <b>free</b> and <b>dom</b>.</p>
<p>One of the origins of the word <a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/free" target="_blank">free</a> is the Old English word freo, meaning &#8220;exempt from; not in bondage, acting of one&#8217;s own will&#8221;. Another one of its origins is the Old English word <a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/free" target="_blank">freogan</a>, which means &#8220;to free, liberate, manumit&#8221;. </p>
<p>As for the word dom, it comes from the Old English word <a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/-dom" target="_blank">dom</a>, which means &#8220;statute, judgment&#8221;.</p>
<p>Based on the definitions in this paragraph, the word freedom means &#8220;<b>to be free or exempt from statute and judgment</b>&#8220;. </p>
<p>Today, there is no country in the world that has true freedom because the laws in every country are based on statue and/or judgment made by man (male and female) who are ignorant of Natural Law (God&#8217;s Law).</p>
<p>Because you now know one of the hidden meanings of freedom, let us investigate the holiday Christmas by studying certain words related to it.</p>
<p>The word Christmas is made up of two words which are Christ and Mass. The word <a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/Christ" target="_blank">Christ</a> comes from the Greek word khristos, meaning &#8220;the anointed&#8221;. The word <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/browse/anoint" target="_blank">anoint</a> means &#8220;to rub or sprinkle on; apply an unguent, ointment, or oily liquid to.&#8221; </p>
<p>As for the word <a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/mass" target="_blank">Mass</a>, it is defined as &#8220;public celebration of the Eucharist in the <a href="http://humansarefree.com/2014/06/roman-catholicism-is-witchcraft.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Roman Catholic Church</a> and some Protestant churches.&#8221;</p>
<p>Based on these definitions, the word <b>Christmas</b> means &#8220;<b>a religious celebration for the anointed</b>.&#8221; Be aware that <a href="http://humansarefree.com/2014/10/the-catholic-liturgy-is-satanic-ritual.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">the word mass has a strong connection to magic rituals that acknowledge and worship the dead</a>.</p>
<p><b><span style="font-size: large">Must-read on the subject:</span></b></p>

</ul>
<p>The external or exoteric version of Christmas is the modern day version of the <a href="http://humansarefree.com/2014/12/the-occult-origin-of-christmas.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ancient Roman holiday called Saturnalia</a>, a religious festival celebrated to honor the <a href="http://humansarefree.com/2015/04/saturn-worshiping-cult-of-el.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">god Saturn</a>. One of <a href="http://humansarefree.com/2017/01/saturn-occult-symbolism-and-cube.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">the symbols of the god Saturn is the cube</a>. </p>
<p>When you unfold a 3D cube in a specific way and put it on a flat surface, it transforms into a cross. This is the cross that is used to symbolize Christianity. It is also the cross that the biblical character Jesus Christ died on. Hence, the word Christ-Mass/ Christmas.</p>
<p><b><span style="font-size: large">In its original sense, the external/ exoteric version of Christmas is a pagan holiday for worshiping the god Saturn.</span></b></p>
<p>The true Jesus Christ exists in the body of each man, woman or child. Esoterically, Jesus represents the &#8220;Sun/Son&#8221; or &#8220;bread/manna&#8221; and the Christ represents the &#8220;holy oil&#8221;. </p>
<p>This is why the Bible verse <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+6%3A51&amp;version=KJV" target="_blank">John 6:51</a> (KJV) says, &#8220;51 I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.&#8221; (Bold emphasis added)</p>
<p>From the perspective of the body, the head is the &#8220;heaven&#8221; and is the place where God dwells. In other words, God dwells within the temples of your head, which is your &#8220;kingdom of heaven&#8221;. They did not call that area of your head the temples for no reason. Hence, the Bible verses <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+3%3A16-17&amp;version=KJV" target="_blank">1 Corinthians 3:16-17</a> (KJV):</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large"><i>16 Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?<br />17 If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.</i></span></p>
<p>Besides Jesus Christ, Santa Claus is an important character of Christmas. Santa Claus represents the claustrum located in the cerebrum of the brain. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claustrum" target="_blank">claustrum</a> is &#8220;a thin, irregular sheet of neurons that is attached to the underside of the neocortex in the center of the brain.&#8221; </p>
<p>The claustrum secretes a yellow and oily substance; when this substance is processed by the body properly, it transforms into the holy oil, known by the ancient Greeks as the &#8220;Christ&#8221;. This oil is sacred and contains the secret of immortality.</p>
<p>When the Jesus/ bread is anointed with the holy oil and used by the body as nourishment, <b>it regenerates and heals the body, allowing the body to live for hundreds, if not, thousands, of years. It may even allow the body to live forever. </b></p>
<p>Hence, the Bible verse <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+6%3A51&amp;version=KJV" target="_blank">John 6:51</a> (KJV), &#8220;51 I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.&#8221; (Bold emphasis added)</p>
<p>When a man (male or female) lives a healthy lifestyle, meditates regularly and does not have excessive sex, he increases his chance of raising the Jesus (Son/Sun) born again every month in his solar plexus. </p>
<p>The word <a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/solar" target="_blank">solar</a> is derived from the Latin word sol, meaning &#8220;sun&#8221;. The solar (sun) plexus is the area of the body where the Sun/ Son of Man is born again every month. </p>
<p>When a man&#8217;s Jesus/ Son/ Sun is able to travel upward from his solar plexus to the temples of his head (Jesus goes to the &#8220;temple&#8221;), it is &#8220;anointed&#8221; with the holy oil and &#8220;sacrificed&#8221; in his brain, supplying his brain with the necessary nourishment to heal his body. </p>
<p>This holy oil is the precious and priceless gift of which the Bible speaks and is the true origin of Christmas/ Christ-Mass (the Mass/Sacrifice of the Jesus/ Son/ Sun and the Christ/holy oil).</p>
<p>To connect the dots, Jesus is the &#8220;manna/ bread of life&#8221; or &#8220;Sun/ Son&#8221;. When he is anointed with the holy oil, he becomes Jesus &#8220;christed&#8221; and then is &#8220;crucified/ sacrificed&#8221; in the Father&#8217;s Kingdom, which is a metaphor for the brain. </p>
<p>Esoterically, the Christmas story is a religious story about the journey of the Jesus (Son/ Sun) returning to the temple of God, which is located between the temples of the head, and being &#8220;anointed&#8221; or &#8220;christed&#8221; with the Christ (holy oil), so it can be &#8220;eaten in the Father&#8217;s Kingdom&#8221;.</p>
<p>Today, most people celebrate Christmas like it is something outside of them. This is the false version of Christmas. People who believe that the external/ exoteric version of Christmas is the true Christmas have been tricked by the false god Santa/ Satan through the art of word magic. </p>
<p>This version of Christmas will not help people achieve spiritual freedom and enlightenment. Furthermore, it will not free them from sin, but will supply them with more sin, causing their physical body to die.</p>
<p>Esoterically, to be &#8220;free from sin&#8221; means that you are &#8220;free from death&#8221;; thereby, those who die are &#8220;sinners&#8221;. The sacred and priceless gift from God that allows your body to overcome death is the Christ/ holy oil. </p>
<p>This is why Jesus Christ (Sun/ Son/ manna/ bread and holy oil) is the savior of mankind. The holy oil or &#8220;savior&#8221; does not exist outside of you; it exists inside your body. To be more specific, it is produced in your brain.</p>
<p>The examples above are only a few examples of how word magic is used to hide important information in plain sight and trick people to believe in something that is not really true. </p>

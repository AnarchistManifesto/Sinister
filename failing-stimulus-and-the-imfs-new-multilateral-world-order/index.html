<a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2015/01/failing-stimulus-and-imfs-new.html"><b>Activist Post</b></a></p>
<p>My theme for 2015 has been the assertion  that this will be a year of shattered illusions; social, political, as  well as economic.  As I have noted in recent articles, 2014 set the  stage for multiple engineered conflicts, including the false conflict  between Eastern and Western financial and political powers, as well as  the growing conflict between OPEC nations, shale producers, as well as  conflicting notions on the security of the dollar’s petro-status and the  security and stability of the European Union.</p>
<p>Since the derivatives and credit crisis of 2008, central banks have  claimed their efforts revolve around intervention against the snowball  effect of classical deflationary market trends.  The REAL purpose of  central bank stimulus actions, however, has been to create an illusory  global financial environment in which traditional economic fundamentals  are either ignored, or no longer reflect the concrete truths they are  meant to convey.  That is to say, the international banking cult has NO  INTEREST whatsoever in saving the current system, despite the  assumptions of many market analysts.  They know full well that fiat  printing, bond buying, and even manipulation of stocks will not change  the nature of the underlying crisis.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>Their only goal has been to stave off the visible effects of the  crisis until a new system is ready (psychologically justified in the  public consciousness) to be put into place.  I wrote extensively about  the admitted plan for a disastrous “economic reset” benefiting only the  global elites in my article <a href="http://www.alt-market.com/articles/2403-the-economic-end-game-explained">“The Economic End Game Explained.”</a></p>
<p>We are beginning to see the holes in the veil placed over the eyes of  the general populace, most notably in the EU, where the elites are now  implementing what I believe to be the final stages of the disruption of  European markets.</p>

<p>The prevailing illusion concerning the EU is that it is a “model” for  the future the globalists wish to create and, therefore, the assumption  is that they would never deliberately allow the transnational union to  fail.  Unfortunately, people who make this argument do not seem to  realize that the EU is NOT a model for the New World Order, it is in  fact a mere stepping stone.</p>
<p>The rising propaganda argument voiced by elites in the International  Monetary Fund and the Bank For International Settlements, not to mention  the ECB, is not that Europe’s troubles stem from its ludicrous  surrender to a faceless bureaucratic machine.  Rather, the argument from  the globalists is that Europe is failing because it is not “centralized  enough”.  Mario Draghi, head of the ECB and member of the board of  directors of the BIS, tried to sell the idea that centralization solves  everything <a href="http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/ecb-eurozone-economic-union-by-mario-draghi-2015-1-2015-01">in an editorial</a> written at the beginning of this year.</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p> Ultimately, economic convergence among countries cannot  be only an entry criterion for monetary union, or a condition that is  met some of the time. It has to be a condition that is fulfilled all of  the time. And for this reason, to  complete monetary union we will ultimately have to deepen our political  union further: to lay down its rights and obligations in a renewed  institutional order.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Make no mistake, the rhetoric that will be used by Fabian-influenced  media pundits and mainstream economic snake-oil salesmen in the coming  months will say that the solution to EU instability as well as global  instability is a single global governing body over the fiscal life of  all nations and peoples. The argument will be that the economic crisis  persists because we continue to cling to the “barbaric relic” of  national sovereignty.</p>
<p>In the meantime, internationalists are protecting the legitimacy of  stimulus actions and banker-led policy by diverting attention away from  the failure of the central planning methodology.</p>
<p>Mario Draghi has recently announced the institution of Europe’s own  QE bond buying program, only months after Japan initiated yet another  stimulus measure of its own, and only months after the Federal Reserve  ended QE with the finale of the taper.</p>
<p>I would point out that essentially the moment the Fed finalized the  taper of QE in the U.S., we immediately began to see a return of stock  volatility, as well as the current plunge in oil prices.  I think it  should now be crystal clear to everyone where stimulus money was really  going, as well as what assumptions oblivious daytraders were operating  on.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/backyardliberty.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-k0NQ-rOJPq0/UPDSF5crnFI/AAAAAAAATcw/i7Q6pBk-hoQ/s200/BL_013-200.gif" alt=""></a>The common claim today is that the QE of Japan and now the ECB are  meant to take up the slack left behind in the manipulation of markets by  the Fed.  I disagree.  As I have been saying since the announcement of  the taper, stimulus measures have a shelf life, and central banks are  not capable of propping up markets for much longer, even if that is  their intention (which it is not).  Why?  Because even though market  fundamentals have been obscured by a fog of manipulation, they  unquestionably still apply.  Real supply and demand will ALWAYS matter –  they are like gravity, and we are forced to deal with them eventually.</p>
<p>Beyond available supply, all trade ultimately depend on two things –  savings and demand.  Without these two things, the economy will  inevitably collapse.  Central bank stimulus does not generated jobs, it  does not generated available credit, it does not generated higher wages,  nor does it generated ample savings.  Thus, the economic crisis  continues unabated and even stock markets are beginning to waver.</p>
<p>As demand collapses due to a lack of strong jobs and savings, it  pulls down on the central bank fiat fueled rocket ship like an increase  in gravity.  The rocket (in this case equities markets and government  debt) hits a point of terminal altitude.  The banks are forced to pour  in even more fiat fuel just to keep the vessel from crashing back to  Earth.  No matter how much fuel they create, the gravity of crashing  demand increases equally in the opposite direction.  In the end, the  rocket will tumble and disintegrate in a spectacular explosion, filled  to capacity with fuel but unable to go anywhere.</p>
<p>Oil markets have expressed this reality in relentless fashion the  past few months.  Real demand growth in oil has been stagnant for years,  yet, because of stimulus, because of the real devaluation of the  dollar, and because of market exuberance, prices were unrealistically  high in comparison.  The crash of oil is a startling sign that the  exuberance is over, and something else is taking shape…</p>
<p>The disconnect within banker propaganda could be best summarized by  Mario Draghi’s recent statements on the ECB’s new stimulus measures.   When asked if he was concerned about the possibility of European QE  triggering currency devaluation and hyperinflation, Draghi had this to  say:</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>I think the best way to answer to this is have we seen lots of inflation since the QE program started? Have  we seen that? And now it’s quite a few years that we started. You know,  our experience since we have these press conferences goes back to a  little more than three years. In these  3 years we’ve lowered interest rates, I don’t know how many times, 4 or  5 times, 6 times maybe. And each times someone was saying, this is  going to be terrible expansionary, there will be inflation. Some  people voted against lowering interest rates way back at the end of  November 2013. We did OMP. We did the LTROs. We did TLTROs. And somehow this runaway inflation hasn’t come yet. </p>
<p>So the jury is still out, but there must be a statute of  limitations. Also for the people who say that there would be inflation,  yes When please. Tell me, within what?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Firstly,  if you are using “official” CPI numbers in the U.S. to gauge whether or  not there has been inflation, then yes, Draghi’s claim appears sound.   However, if you use the traditional method (pre-1990s) <a href="http://www.shadowstats.com/alternate_data/inflation-charts">to calculate CPI</a>  rather than the new and incomplete method, inflation over the past few  years has stood at around 8%-10%, and most essential goods including  most food items have risen in price by 30% or more, far above the  official 0%-1% numbers presented by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>
<p>But  beyond real inflation numbers I find a very humorous truth within  Draghi’s rather disingenuous statement; yes, QE has not yet produced  hyperinflation in the U.S. (primarily because the untold trillions in  fiat created still sit idle in the coffers of international banks rather  than circulating freely); however, what HAS stimulus actually  accomplished if not inflation?  Certainly not any semblance of economic  recovery.</p>
<p>Look  at it this way; I could also claim that if international bankers lined  up on a stage at Davos and danced the funky-chicken, hyperinflation  would probably not result.  But what is the point of dancing the funky  chicken and, really, what is the point of QE?  Stimulus clearly has  about as much positive effect on the economy as jerking around  rhythmically in tight polypropylene disco pants.</p>

And what is the real cost/benefit ratio of that purchase of  half a decade of fiscal purgatory?  When the breakdown of debt and forex  markets does occur, it will be a hundred times worse than if the Fed  had done nothing at all.  Which brings me to our current state of  affairs in 2015, and the IMF plan to take advantage…</p>
<p>IMF head Christine Lagarde put out <a href="http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/multilateralism-and-the-global-economy-by-christine-lagarde-2015-01">a press release</a>  this past week, one which was probably drafted for her by a team of  ghouls at the BIS, mentioning the formation of what she called the “New  Multilateralism”.</p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>Lagarde begins with the same old song about accommodative monetary policy:</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>Besides structural reforms, building new  momentum will require pulling all possible levers that can support  global demand. Accommodative monetary policy will remain essential for  as long as growth remains anemic – though we must pay careful attention  to potential spillovers. Fiscal policy should be focused on promoting  growth and creating jobs, while maintaining medium-term credibility</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of  course, as we have already established, monetary policy does nothing to  inspire demand.  So, what is a global syndicate of bankers to do?   Promote maximum interdependency!  Lagarde laments the impediments of the  sovereign attitude:</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>No economy is an island; indeed, the global  economy is more integrated than ever before. Consider this: Fifty years  ago, emerging markets and developing economies accounted for about a  quarter of world GDP. Today, they generate half of global income, a  share that will continue to rise. </p>
<p>But  sovereign states are no longer the only actors on the scene. A global  network of new stakeholders has emerged, including NGOs and citizen  activists – often empowered by social media. This new reality demands a  new response. We will need to update, adapt, and deepen our methods of  working together.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And  here we have a more subtle insinuation of the planning and programming I  have been warning about for years.  Because national sovereignty is no  longer “practical” in an economically interdependent world (a world  forced into economic interdependency by the globalists themselves), we  must now change our way of thinking to support a more globalist  framework.</p>
<div class="code-block code-block-1" style="margin: 0px">
<div align="center" class="mrf-external">
<a href="https://amorain.com/?E=ikLQsSIi%2fgaXBh0SRK5s8g%3d%3d&amp;s1="><img src="https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/500.jpg"></a></p>

</div>
<p>The  first big lie is that interdependency is a natural economic state.   Historically, economies are more likely to survive and thrive the LESS  dependent they are on outside factors.  Independent, self contained,  self sustaining, decentralized economies are the natural and preferable  cultural path.</p>
<p>Multilateralism (centralization) is completely contrary  and destructive to this natural state, as we have already witnessed in  the kind of panic which ensues across the globe when even one small  nation, like Switzerland, <a href="http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-01-15/switzerland-ambushes-the-global-economy">decides to break from the accepted pattern</a> of interdependency.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/familysurvivalsystem.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-FNX5buD7gFA/U2KovfyZRBI/AAAAAAAAAlk/oDTnmRV75Ng/s220/fsc-2.jpg" alt=""></a>Also,  take note of Lagarde’s reference to the growing role that developing  nations (BRICS) are playing in this interdependent globalized mish-mash.   As I have been warning, the IMF and the international banks fully  intend to bring the BRICS further into the fold of the “new  multilateralism”, and the supposed conflict between the East and the  West is a ridiculous farce designed only as theater for the masses.</p>
<p>Lagarde  reiterates the IMF push for inclusion of the BRICS (new networks of  influence) into the new system, as well as the IMF’s role as the arbiter  of global governance:</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>This can be  done by building on effective institutions of cooperation that already  exist. Institutions like the IMF should be made even more representative  in light of the dynamic shifts taking place in the global economy. The  new networks of influence should be embraced and given space in the  twenty-first century architecture of global governance. This is what I  have called the “new multilateralism.” I believe it is the only way to  address the challenges that the global community faces.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The  IMF head finishes with my favorite line, one which should tell you all  you need to know about what is about to happen in 2015.  I have for some  time been following the progress (or lack of progress) in the IMF  reforms presented in 2010; reforms which the U.S. Congress has refused  to pass.  Why?  I believe the reforms remain dormant because the U.S. is  MEANT to lose its veto powers within the IMF, and the <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303887804579501252344303012">IMF has already made clear</a> that lack of passage will result in just that.</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>Against  this backdrop, the adoption of the IMF reforms by the United States  Congress would send a long-overdue signal to rapidly growing emerging  economies that the world counts on their voices, and their resources, to  find global solutions to global problems.</p>
<p>Growth, trade, development, and climate change: 2015 will be a rendezvous of important multilateral initiatives. We cannot afford to see them fail. Let us make the right choices.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why  remove U.S. veto power?  Because BRICS nations like China are about to  be given far more inclusion in the IMF’s multilateralist order.  In  fact, 2015 is the year in which the IMF’s Special Drawing Rights  conference is set to commence, with initial discussions in May, and  international meetings in October.  I believe U.S. veto power will  probably be removed by May, making the way clear (creating the  rationale) for the marginalization of the U.S. dollar in favor of the  SDR basket currency system, soon to be boosted by China’s induction.</p>
<p>In  2015 what we really have is a sprint towards currency and market  devaluation across the spectrum.  India, Japan, Russia, Europe, parts of  South America, have all been debased monetarily.  The U.S. has as well,  most Americans just don’t know it yet.  The value of this for  globalists is far reaching.  They have at a basic level created an  atmosphere of lowered economic expectations – a global reduction in  living standards which will at bottom lead to third-world status for  everyone.  The elites hope that this will be enough to condition the  public to support centralized financial control as the only option for  survival.</p>
<p>It  is hard to say what kind of Black Swans and false flags will be  conjured in the meantime, but I highly doubt the shift towards the SDR  will take place without considerable geopolitical turmoil.  The public  will require some sizable scapegoats for the kind of pain they will feel  as the banks attempt to place the global economy in a totalitarian  choke hold.  While certain institutions may be held up as sacrificial  lambs (including possibly the Federal Reserve itself), the concept of  banker governance will be promoted as the best and only solution,  despite the undeniable reality that the world would be a far better  place if such men and their structures of influence were to be wiped off  the face of the planet entirely.</p>

<p>How would America ever survive without the central planners in the  Obama administration and at the Federal Reserve?  What in the world  would we do if there was no income tax and no IRS?  Could the U.S.  economy possibly keep from collapsing under such circumstances?</p>
<p>The  mainstream media would have us believe that unless we have someone “<a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-07-23/santelli-vs-liesman-who-pulls-levers" target="_blank" title="to pull the levers">to pull the levers</a>”  our economy would descend into utter chaos, but the truth is that the  best period of economic growth in U.S. history occurred during a time  when there was no income tax and no Federal Reserve.</p>
<p>Between the Civil  War and 1913, the U.S. economy experienced absolutely explosive growth.   The free market system thrived and the rest of the world looked at us  with envy.  The federal government was very limited in size, there was  no income tax for most of that time and there was no central bank.  To  many Americans, it would be absolutely unthinkable to have such a  society today, but it actually worked very, very well.  Without the  inventions and innovations that came out of that period, the world would  be a far different place today.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>It is amazing what can happen when the government just gets out of the way.  Check out all of the wonderful things that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_history_of_the_United_States#The_Gilded_Age:_1865.E2.80.931900" target="_blank" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> says happened for the U.S. economy during those years…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The rapid economic development following the Civil War  laid the groundwork for the modern U.S. industrial economy. By 1890, the  USA leaped ahead of Britain for first place in manufacturing output. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>An explosion of new discoveries and inventions took place, a process  called the “Second Industrial Revolution.” Railroads greatly expanded  the mileage and built stronger tracks and bridges that handled heavier  cars and locomotives, carrying far more goods and people at lower rates.  Refrigeration railroad cars came into use. The telephone, phonograph,  typewriter and electric light were invented. By the dawn of the 20th  century, cars had begun to replace horse-drawn carriages. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Parallel to these achievements was the development of the nation’s  industrial infrastructure. Coal was found in abundance in the  Appalachian Mountains from Pennsylvania south to Kentucky. Oil was  discovered in western Pennsylvania; it was mainly used for lubricants  and for kerosene for lamps. Large iron ore mines opened in the Lake  Superior region of the upper Midwest. Steel mills thrived in places  where these coal and iron ore could be brought together to produce  steel. Large copper and silver mines opened, followed by lead mines and  cement factories. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1913 Henry Ford introduced the assembly line, a step in the process that became known as mass-production.</p>

<p>
When hard working, industrious people are given freedom to pursue  their dreams, great things tend to happen.  The truth is that we were  all designed to create, to invent, to build, and to trade with one  another.  We all have something that we can contribute to society, and <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/27-facts-that-prove-that-the-family-in-america-is-in-the-worst-shape-ever" title="when families are strong">when families are strong</a> and the invisible hand of the free market is allowed to work, societies tend to prosper.</p>
<p>It is not a coincidence that the greatest period of economic growth  in U.S. history was between the Civil War and 1913.  The following  information comes from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_history_of_the_United_States#The_Gilded_Age:_1865.E2.80.931900" target="_blank" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Gilded Age saw the greatest period of economic growth  in American history. After the short-lived panic of 1873, the economy  recovered with the advent of hard money policies and industrialization.  From 1869 to 1879, the US economy grew at a rate of 6.8% for real GDP  and 4.5% for real GDP per capita, despite the panic of 1873.  The  economy repeated this period of growth in the 1880s, in which the wealth  of the nation grew at an annual rate of 3.8%, while the GDP was also  doubled.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wouldn’t you like U.S. GDP to double over the course of a decade now?</p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>So why don’t we go back to a system like that?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bloggersecret.com/" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-W_QDsMeuL2M/T8kFjUwCVXI/AAAAAAAAPEk/RT2DHTDyOsI/s300/300x250_v002.gif" width="200"></a>In 1913, the Federal Reserve and a permanent national income tax were  introduced.  Today, the unelected central planners at the Federal  Reserve totally run our financial system and the U.S. tax code is about <a href="http://www.cnsnews.com/blog/gregory-gwyn-williams-jr/obama-proposes-more-taxes-tax-code-already-13-miles-long" target="_blank" title="13 miles long">13 miles long</a>.   The value of our currency has declined by more than 96 percent since  1913, and the size of our national debt has gotten more than 5000 times  larger.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, control freak bureaucrats seemingly run everything.   Almost every business decision is heavily influenced either by taxes or  by the millions of laws, rules and regulations that are sucking the life  out of our economic system.</p>
<p>My favorite example of how suffocating red tape in America has become  is the magician out in Missouri that was forced by the Obama  administration to submit <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/obama-administration-requires-magician-to-submit-a-32-page-disaster-plan-for-his-rabbit" target="_blank" title='a 32 page "disaster plan"'>a 32-page “disaster plan”</a> for the rabbit that he uses during his magic shows for kids.</p>
<p>It is no wonder why we don’t have any economic growth.  The central planners in the federal government are killing our economy.</p>
<p>And the central planners over at the Federal Reserve are killing our  financial system.  In school we are taught that the Fed was created to  bring stability to our financial system, but the truth is that they have  been responsible for financial bubble after financial bubble, and now  Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has created <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/farewell-bernanke-thanks-for-inflating-the-biggest-bond-bubble-the-world-has-ever-seen" title="the largest bond bubble in the history of the world">the largest bond bubble in the history of the world</a>.  When that thing bursts, <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/the-most-important-number-in-the-entire-u-s-economy" title="and it will">and it will</a>, we are going to see financial carnage on an unprecedented scale.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the truth is that the Federal Reserve never has been  looking out for the interests of the American people.  It was created by  the big banks and it has always worked very hard to benefit the big  banks.  During the Fed era, the big banks have become <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/who-controls-the-global-economy-do-not-underestimate-the-power-of-the-big-banks" title="the most powerful economic entities on the entire planet">the most powerful economic entities on the entire planet</a>.   Our entire economy is now based on debt, and the big banks are at the  very center of this debt spiral.  The following is an excerpt from a  recent article <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/big-banks-conspiracy-is-destroying-america-2013-08-07?pagenumber=2" target="_blank" title="by Paul B. Farrell">by Paul B. Farrell</a>…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today’s world includes four Wall Street banks each with assets  over $1 trillion, each more than Goldman. Plus eight other big global  banks each have over $2 trillion total assets, including, among the 100  largest, Barclays, HSBC, Deutsche, ICB-China and Japan’s Mitsubishi. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div id="">Yes, this new world is changing fast. Back in 2008 the world’s  financial banks were in ruins. Wall Street sunk into virtually  bankruptcy. Goldman and its Wall Street too-big-to-fail co-conspirators  had trashed the global economy, triggered a virtual depression, and Wall  Street’s casinos lost over $10 trillion of Main Street retirement  funds.</div>
</blockquote>
<p>And as we saw back in 2008, the Federal Reserve is going to do  whatever is necessary to prop up Wall Street.  Most Americans never even  heard about this, but during the last financial crisis the Fed <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/the-looting-of-america-the-federal-reserve-made-16-trillion-in-secret-loans-to-their-bankster-friends-and-the-media-is-ignoring-the-eye-popping-corruption-that-has-been-uncovered" target="_blank" title="secretly loaned 16 trillion dollars">secretly loaned 16 trillion dollars</a>  to the big banks.  Those loans were nearly interest-free and those  banks knew that they could get basically as much nearly interest-free  money as they wanted from the Fed.</p>
<p>So how much nearly interest-free money did the Fed loan to normal Americans?</p>
<p>Not a single penny.</p>
<p>That would be bad enough, but it is also important to remember that since 2008 the Fed <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/the-federal-reserve-is-paying-banks-not-to-lend-1-8-trillion-dollars-to-the-american-people" title="has actually been paying banks">has actually been paying banks</a> <strong>NOT</strong> to lend money to the rest of us.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/backyardliberty.html" rel="nofollow" style="float: right;margin-left: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-k0NQ-rOJPq0/UPDSF5crnFI/AAAAAAAATcw/i7Q6pBk-hoQ/s200/BL_013-200.gif" alt=""></a>What is it going to take for the American people to start demanding  that the Fed be abolished?  They are absolutely destroying our financial  system.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the central planners in the Obama administration have been  doing their part as well.  During the second quarter of this year, the  number of Americans working between 30 and 34 hours per week fell by <a href="http://news.investors.com/080513-666340-obamacare-cuts-part-time-jobs-below-30-hours-data-show.htm?p=full" target="_blank" title="146,500">146,500</a>.  During that same time period, the number of Americans working between 25 and 29 hours rose by 119,000.</p>
<p>Why is this happening?</p>
<p>Well, the Obamacare employer mandate will apply to workers that work  at least 30 hours each week, so employers are starting to cut back on  the hours their employees are getting in order to comply with the law.</p>
<p>But this is just one example out of thousands, and most Americans already know that the U.S. economy <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/40-stats-that-prove-the-u-s-economy-has-already-been-collapsing-over-the-past-decade" title="has been crumbling for many years">has been crumbling for many years</a>.</p>
<p>In fact, things have gotten so bad that even <a href="http://washingtonexaminer.com/more-dems-than-republicans-53-27-say-american-dream-is-dead/article/2534019" target="_blank" title="53 percent">53 percent</a> of all Democrats believe that the American Dream is <strong>dead</strong> even though Barack Obama is residing in the White House.</p>
<p>But this is just the beginning.  Things are going to get much, much  worse.  We are going down the same path that Greece has gone, and the  unemployment rate in Greece has just hit a new all-time record high of <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/greeces-unemployment-rate-record-high-2013-8" target="_blank" title="27.6 percent">27.6 percent</a>.</p>
<p>That is where the U.S. is headed eventually.  Decades of very foolish decisions are catching up with us.</p>
<p>The primary reason why all of this is happening is debt.  As a society, we simply have <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/share-this-chart-with-anyone-that-believes-the-u-s-economy-is-not-going-to-crash" title="way, way, way too much debt">way, way, way too much debt</a>.</p>
<p>The biggest offender, of course, is the federal government.  Since 1970, federal spending has grown <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-08-08/40-years-unbearable-heaviness-being-american-taxpayer" target="_blank" title="nearly 12 times as rapidly">nearly 12 times as rapidly</a> as median household income has, and since the year 2000 the size of the U.S. national debt has grown <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/40-stats-that-prove-the-u-s-economy-has-already-been-collapsing-over-the-past-decade" title="by more than 11 trillion dollars">by more than 11 trillion dollars</a>.</p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>When government debt gets too large, it has a profoundly negative  effect on an economy.  The following is an excerpt from an outstanding  article <a href="http://www.caseyresearch.com/articles/the-federal-reserve-relies-on-a-flawed-economic-model" target="_blank" title="by Lacy H. Hunt, a Ph.D. economist">by Lacy H. Hunt, a Ph.D. economist</a>…</p>
<p>*****</p>
<p>Here are the studies, starting with the one with the broadest implications:</p>
<ol>
<li>“Government Size and Growth: A Survey and Interpretation of the Evidence,” from <em>Journal of Economic Surveys</em>.  Published in April 2011, Swedish economists Andreas Bergh and Magnus  Henrekson (both of the Research Institute of Industrial Economics at  Lund University) found a “significant negative correlation” between size  of government and economic growth. Specifically, “an increase in  government size by 10 percentage points is associated with a 0.5% to 1%  lower annual growth rate.”</li>
<li>“The Impact of High and Growing Government Debt on Economic Growth: An Empirical Investigation for the Euro Area,” in <em>European Central Bank working paper</em>, Number 1237, August 2010<em>. </em>Cristina  Checherita and Philipp Rother found that a government-debt-to-GDP ratio  above the threshold of 90-100% has a “deleterious” impact on long-term  growth. Additionally, the impact of debt on growth is nonlinear – as the  government debt rises to higher and higher levels, the adverse growth  consequences accelerate.</li>
<li>
<em>The Real Effects of Debt</em>, published by the Bank for  International Settlements (BIS) in Basel, Switzerland in August 2011.  Stephen G. Cecchetti, M. S.Mohanty, and Fabrizio Zampolli determined  that “beyond a certain level, debt is bad for growth. For government  debt, the number is about 85% of GDP.”</li>
<li>
<a href="http://activistpost.net/familysurvival.html" rel="nofollow" style="float: right;margin-left: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ASIFGy_z7zU/UCFiDQK8GBI/AAAAAAAAROU/7AHejVY_hUE/s202/3.gif"></a>“Public Debt Overhangs: Advanced-Economy Episodes Since 1800,”by Carmen M. Reinhart, Vincent R. Reinhart, Kenneth S. Rogoff, <em>Journal of Economic Perspectives</em>,  Volume 26, Number 3, Summer 2012, pages 69-86. The authors identified  26 cases of “debt overhangs,” which they define as public-debt-to-GDP  levels exceeding 90% for at least five years. In spite of the many  idiosyncratic differences in these situations, economic growth fell in  all but three of the 26 cases. All of the instances, which lasted an  average of 23 years, are included in the paper. They found that average  annual growth is 1.2% lower for countries with a debt overhang than for  countries without. The long duration of such episodes means that  cumulative shortfall from the debt excess—<em>i.e.</em>, several years in a row of subpar economic growth—is potentially massive.</li>
</ol>
<p>*****</p>
<p>But it isn’t just federal government debt that is the problem.  The rest of us have way too much debt as well.</p>
<p>If you can believe it, the ratio of private debt to GDP was <a href="http://www.caseyresearch.com/articles/the-federal-reserve-relies-on-a-flawed-economic-model" target="_blank" title="273.3%">273.3%</a> for the twelve months ending in the first quarter of 2013.</p>
<div class="code-block code-block-1" style="margin: 0px">
<div align="center" class="mrf-external">
<a href="https://amorain.com/?E=ikLQsSIi%2fgaXBh0SRK5s8g%3d%3d&amp;s1="><img src="https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/500.jpg"></a></p>

</div>
<p>That is an astounding figure.</p>
<p>And <a href="http://www.caseyresearch.com/articles/the-federal-reserve-relies-on-a-flawed-economic-model" target="_blank" title="as Hunt explained">as Hunt explained</a>, having too much private debt is also very bad for an economy…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In <em>Too Much Finance</em>, published by the United  Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) in March 2011, Jean  Louis Arcand, Enrico Berkes, and Ugo Panizza found a negative effect on  output growth when credit to the private sector reaches 104-110% of  GDP. The strongest adverse effects are for credit over 160% of GDP. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The second is the 2011 BIS study authored by Cecchetti, Mohanty, and  Zampolli. They found that private debt levels become “cancerous” (in BIS  economic advisor Cecchetti’s own words) at 175% (90% for corporations  and 85% for households)—just slightly more than the UNCTAD study.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you add our private debt-to-GDP ratio of 273 percent to our  federal debt-to-GDP ratio of 101 percent, you get a grand total of 384  percent.</p>
<p>This is how we have funded the false prosperity of the past couple of  decades.  Essentially, we have been putting our good times on a credit  card.</p>
<p>And as anyone that has ever tried to live on credit knows, the good times eventually run out.</p>
<p>But this is what the Federal Reserve was designed to do.  It was  designed to get the U.S. government trapped in a debt spiral from which  there would never be any escape.</p>
<p>It is not an accident that our national debt has gotten more than  5000 times larger than it was when the Fed was originally created.  This  is what the bankers wanted the system to do.</p>
<p>They wanted a system that would extract wealth from all of us through  taxes, transfer it to the government, and then transfer it to them  through interest payments.</p>
<p>We never needed a central bank, we never needed the IRS and we never  needed an income tax.</p>
<p>America would be doing just fine without any of  them.</p>
<p>But instead, America chose to go down the path of collectivization  and central planning, and now we are heading toward the biggest economic  disaster in the history of mankind.</p>

<p><em>By Jon Dougherty</em></p>
<p>While the Left-wing establishment media no doubt wants everyone to forget about the most controversial Democratic governor in the country, Ralph Northam of Virginia, the so-called “alternative media” continues to dig into his past and his present to reveal new and startling facts about who he really is.</p>
<p>You may recall that Northam was “<a href="https://bigleaguepolitics.com/yearbook-ralph-northam-in-blackface-photo/">outed</a>” last month by <em>Big League Politics</em> for a photograph that appeared in his 1984 medical school yearbook featuring one person in blackface and another wearing a KKK hood and robe.</p>
</p>
<p>Northam’s initial responses to the story were a mixed bag of denials, apologies, and mea culpas that eventually led him to launch a so-called “apology tour” in which he sought to appease his state’s black voters (and the Democratic Party nationally).</p>
<p>It didn’t start out well, however, as <em>Vice</em> <a href="https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/bjqy78/virginia-gov-ralph-northams-apology-tour-got-off-to-a-really-bad-start">reported</a>:</p>
<p><em>The historically black Virginia Union University was supposed to be the first place for Northam to atone for the photo in his 1984 yearbook of a person in Klan garb and another in blackface, which sparked a backlash and calls for his resignation when it surfaced online about 3 weeks ago. </em></p>
<p><em>While some attendees of the VUU event, whose main purpose was to honor the Richmond 34 civil rights activists, were happy to let their ceremony serve as a place for the governor to begin learning and apologizing for his racist act, the student body felt blindsided.</em></p>
<p><em>Student Government Association President Jamon Phenix penned a letter addressed to Gov. Northam demanding he back out of the event, explaining that the students “feel as though your presence takes away from the historical significance of our commemoration.” Northam agreed not to attend.</em></p>
<div id="ld-8620-9820"></div>
</p>
<p>Next up, Northam’s wife, first lady Pam Northam, is <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/virginia-first-lady-pam-northam-apologizes-after-handing-cotton-black-n977546">apologizing</a> this week to black children after a major moment of tone-deafness: Handing out raw cotton to black students touring the governor’s mansion earlier this month and asking them to ‘imagine’ being slaves and having to pick the crop.</p>
<h2>Ties to slavery</h2>
<p>As if these incidents weren’t telling in and of themselves and bad enough for the Northam’s, <em>Spectator USA </em><a href="https://spectator.us/ralph-northams-family-84-slaves/">reported</a> more revealing news on Thursday — Ralph Northam’s family owned at least 84 slaves, a fact he said he only <a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/ralph-northam-s-ancestors-owned-slaves-he-found-out-only/article_24ebbe1b-03ff-545b-bf60-abe4bcc4e790.html">learned</a> about in 2017.</p>

<p><em>Spectator USA </em>notes:</p>
<p><em>That story is harder to believe once you see that three out of the four grandparental lines of his family owned slaves. Two branches owned at least two dozen.</em></p>
<p><em>On his father’s side are the Northams, who have been in Accomack County on the Eastern Shore since at least the late 18th century. Northam’s paternal grandmother9 was a Brownlee, descended from both the convener of the Abbeville meeting and his son, the Red Shirt terrorist, as Spectator USA previously <a href="https://spectator.us/ralph-northam-great-grandfather/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://spectator.us/ralph-northam-great-grandfather/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1551453849038000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGDAxjgtuCAbkTHUR3ZFhG7T0d9Xg">reported</a>.</em></p>

<p><em>Northam’s maternal grandmother married a Yankee from Pennsylvania named Shearer, so his branch is out. But her own ancestors include the Franklins, who lived in Suffolk in Nansemond County, Virginia. Jethro Riddick Franklin, Northam’s great-great-grandfather on his mother’s side, was a private in the Confederate Army, 41st Virginia Infantry.</em></p>
<p><em>James Northam, Ralph’s paternal great-great-grandfather, owned the fewest slaves of the three individuals we’ll look at today. The 1850 census shows he owned nine in Accomack County at the time.</em></p>
<p><em>The elder John Brownlee, also on Northam’s father’s side, owned 46 slaves in Abbeville, according to the 1860 census. He thus had a significant property interest in secession.</em></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Jethro Riddick Franklin, on Northam’s mother’s side, is buried in Cedar Hill Cemetery at Suffolk, Va. Though he was discharged as a private in the Confederate Army, he wasn’t poor; he owned 29 slaves.</p>
<p>On Northam’s mother’s side, Jethro Riddick Franklin is buried in Cedar Hill Cemetery in Suffolk, Virginia. Despite being discharged as only a private in the Confederate Army, he was not a poor man and owned 29 slaves. According to historical records examined by <em>Spectator USA</em>, most of Franklin’s slaves at the time were children.</p>
<h2><strong>The ‘infanticide’ governor</strong></h2>
<p>As if Northam’s apparent racism and family ties to slavery weren’t enough, let’s also recall what got the Virginia Democrat in so much hot water with residents of his state and tens of millions of Americans around the country: His support for what can only be deemed “infanticide.”</p>
<p>In late January, Northam gave his tacit support for legislation that had been introduced in the State Assembly which would have repealed current restrictions on when abortions can legally be performed.</p>
<p>During an appearance on <em>WTOP’s</em> ‘Ask The Governor’ program, he was asked what he thought about the legislation, which was introduced by Del. Kathy Tran (D). According to her legislation, if approved and signed into law by Northam, women would be able to receive an abortion up to, but right before, natural full-term delivery.</p>
<p>He responded:</p>
<p><em>This is why decisions such as this should be made by providers, physicians, and the mothers and fathers that are involved. When we talk about third-trimester abortions, these are done with the consent of obviously the mother, with the consent of the physician — more than one physician, by the way — and it’s done in cases where there may be severe deformities. There may be a fetus that’s non-viable.</em></p>

<p><em>If a mother is in labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen. The infant would be delivered. The infant would be kept comfortable. The infant would be resuscitated if that’s what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother.</em></p>
<p>In other words, the medical facility would keep the baby “comfortable” until the mother and abortion doctor decided what to do next, which directly implies that the result might be ending the baby’s life.</p>

<h2>Supporter and benefactor of Planned Parenthood</h2>
<p>Northam was lambasted by conservatives around the country and Republicans in Congress, but a deeper dive into his past and present provides further insight into his beliefs.</p>
<p>As we <a href="https://thenationalsentinel.com/2019/01/31/in-his-own-words-no-denying-that-va-gov-northam-now-supporting-infanticide/">reported</a> in February, when Northam decided to run for the governor of Virginia in 2017, he wasn’t going to campaign penniless and alone: Planned Parenthood pledged to accompany him on his journey.</p>
<p>“It’s really clear that Virginians want and need a fierce champion like Dr. Northam to stand up for them and to stand up for women’s health,” Jennifer Allen, chief executive of Planned Parenthood Virginia PAC and Planned Parenthood Advocates of Virginia, noted as she announced that abortion supporters would spend up to $3 million to elect Northam, who also served in the U.S. Army Medical Corps, <em><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/va-arm-of-planned-parenthood-to-spend-3-million-backing-northam-for-governor/2017/08/02/ccea4b5c-7795-11e7-8839-ec48ec4cae25_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.561e725a421b" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Washington Post</a> </em>reported at the time.</p>
<p>True to her word, Planned Parenthood poured $1.99 million into Northam’s campaign, according to <a href="https://www.vpap.org/candidates/67038/top_donors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Virginia Public Access Project</a>, after praising the children’s doctor for taking “bold actions” to support abortion.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">So. Gov. Northam got $2 mil from Planned Parenthood.  That&#8217;s real money.

<h2>Channeling Margaret Sanger?</h2>
<p>Planned Parenthood, as a reminder, was the predecessor of the American Birth Control League, founded by “eugenics” extremist Margaret Sanger in 1921.</p>
<p>Left-wing history revisionists have attempted to downplay Sanger’s racism and role in ensuring that blacks, in particular, were excessively targeted for ‘elimination’ via ‘birth control’ — abortion, eventually.</p>
<p>For example, <em>NPR</em> <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/08/14/432080520/fact-check-was-planned-parenthood-started-to-control-the-black-population">reported</a> in August 2015 in a “fact check” piece that Sanger was indeed a believer in eugenics — ” a discipline, championed by prominent scientists but now widely debunked, that promoted ‘good’ breeding and aimed to prevent ‘poor’ breeding.”</p>
<p>Further:</p>
<p><em>The idea was that the human race could be bettered through encouraging people with traits like intelligence, hard work, cleanliness (thought to be genetic) to reproduce. Eugenics was taken to its horrifying extreme during the Holocaust, through forced sterilizations and breeding experiments.</em></p>
<p><em>In the United States, eugenics intersected with the birth control movement in the 1920s, and Sanger reportedly spoke at eugenics conferences. She also talked about birth control being used to facilitate “the process of weeding out the unfit [and] of preventing the birth of defectives.”</em></p>
<p>NPR claimed that historians “seem to disagree” on how deeply committed to the concept of eugenics that Sanger really was, but the public media organization was adamant that Sanger was no racist:</p>
<p><em>Her attitude toward African-Americans can certainly be viewed as paternalistic, but there is no evidence she subscribed to the more racist ideas of the time or that she coerced black women into using birth control. In fact, for her time, as the Washington Post noted, “she would likely be considered to have advanced views on race relations.”</em></p>
<p><ins class="Adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="In-Article" data-ad-format="Fluid" data-ad-client="Ca-Pub-8193958963374960" data-ad-slot="4302732352"></ins> </p>
<p>Such apologists paint over the true Sanger. As Rebecca Hagelin <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/23/margaret-sanger-founded-planned-parenthood-on-raci/">documented</a> in the <em>Washington Times</em> in April 2017, Sanger was as blatant a racist as there was and she certainly ascribed to the concept of eugenics and birth control as a means of keeping as much of the American black population from breeding as possible.</p>
<p>Hagelin quoted Sanger from one of her writings:</p>
<p><em>Minorities crammed into impoverished areas in inner cities should not be having so many babies. And, of course, these minorities (including most of America’s immigrants) are inferior in the human race, as are the physically and mentally handicapped. We should require mandatory sterilizations of those less desirable and promote easy access to abortion. And since sex should be a free-for-all, we must provide birth control and abortions to teenagers too. It’s all for the greater good and for a more intelligent, liberated, healthier population.</em></p>
<p>Those “are the foundational beliefs of this inherently racist organization and its celebrated founder, Margaret Sanger, who still is lauded on the Planned Parenthood website,” Hagelin noted.</p>
<p>Sanger once also advocated for “a stern and rigid policy of sterilization and segregation to that grade of population whose progeny is already tainted, or whose inheritance is such that objectionable traits may be transmitted to offspring,” according to her writings.</p>
<p>Adds Hagelin:</p>
<p><em>Also missing is Sanger’s fear of her racist views being exposed, as recorded in a 1939 letter to an ally: “We do not want word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population.” Which is exactly what she set out and succeeded in doing.</em></p>
<p>Planned Parenthood, she adds, is primarily responsible for the number of black babies being aborted in the U.S. at three times more often than white babies and one-and-a-half-times more than Hispanic babies.</p>
<p>According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention research compiled by TooManyAborted.com, “Abortion is the number one killer of black lives in the United States. More than HIV. More than heart disease. More than cancer. Abortion snuffs out more black lives than all other causes of death combined.”</p>
<h2>Northam: Racist Planned Parenthood benefactor</h2>
<p>All of this may be considered circumstantial evidence in a court of law — the slave-owning family history, the med school yearbook photo, the financial ties to Planned Parenthood and the organization’s ties to an overt racist eugenics follower.</p>
<p>But in the court of public opinion, however, the evidence is strong: Ralph Northam’s attitudes towards black people and abortion have depth, history, and reek of conviction.</p>

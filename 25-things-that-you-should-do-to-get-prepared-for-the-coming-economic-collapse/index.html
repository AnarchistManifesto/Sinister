<b><a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2013/04/25-things-that-you-should-do-to-get.html">Activist Post</a></b></p>
<p>Do you think that you know how to prepare for the collapse of the  economy?  If so, are you putting that knowledge into action?  In America  today, people are more concerned about the possibility of an economic  collapse than ever before.  It has been estimated that there are now <a href="http://www.shtfplan.com/emergency-preparedness/doomsday-report-three-million-preppers-in-america-are-getting-for-the-end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it_02112012" target="_blank" title="three million preppers">three million preppers</a>  in the United States.  But the truth that nobody really knows the  actual number, because a lot of preppers keep their “prepping” to  themselves.  So what are all of those people preparing for exactly?</p>
<p>Well, <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/the-number-one-catastrophic-event-that-americans-worry-about-economic-collapse" title="survey after survey">survey after survey</a>  has shown that “economic collapse” is the number one potential disaster  that preppers are most concerned about.  Of course that shouldn’t be  surprising because we truly are facing economic problems that are  absolutely unprecedented.  We are living in <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/why-is-the-world-economy-doomed-the-global-financial-pyramid-scheme-by-the-numbers" title="the greatest debt bubble">the greatest debt bubble</a>  in the history of the world, the global banking system has been  transformed into a high-risk pyramid scheme of debt, risk and leverage  that could collapse at any time, and wealthy countries such as the  United States have been living way above their means for decades.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the United States is being <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/55-reasons-why-you-should-buy-products-that-are-made-in-america-this-holiday-season" title="deindustrialized">deindustrialized</a> at a blinding pace and poverty in this country is <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/21-statistics-about-the-explosive-growth-of-poverty-in-america-that-everyone-should-know" title="absolutely exploding">absolutely exploding</a>.   Anyone that is not concerned about the economy should have their head  examined.  Fortunately, I have found that an increasing number of  Americans are becoming convinced that we are heading for a horrific  economic crisis.  Once they come to that realization, they want to know  what they should do.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>And the reality is that “getting prepared” is going to look different  for each family based on their own unique circumstances.  Some people  have a lot of resources, while others have very little.  Some people are  very independent of the system and can move wherever they want, while  others are totally dependent on their jobs and must stay near the cities  at least for now.</p>
<div align="center">
<p>    <ins class="adsbygoogle" style="height: 90px;width: 728px"></ins></p>
<p>    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || ).push({});</p>
</div>
<p>
In addition, it is important to distinguish between the “short-term”  and the “long-term” when talking about economic collapse.  As I have  written about <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/the-economic-collapse-is-not-a-single-event" title="previously">previously</a>,  our economic collapse is not going to happen all at once.  It is going  to unfold over time.  In the “short-term”, many are moving money around  and are building up “emergency funds” to prepare for the next  recession.  For the “long-term”, many are storing up food and huge  stockpiles of survival supplies in order to be prepared for the total  collapse of society.  Both approaches are wise, but it is important to  keep in mind that different approaches will be needed at different  times.</p>
<p>The strategies posted below are a mix of both short-term and  long-term strategies.  Some will be important for our immediate future,  while others may not be needed for a number of years.  But in the end,  you will be very thankful for the time and the effort that you spent  getting prepared while you still could.</p>
<p>The following are 25 things that you should do to get prepared for the coming economic collapse…</p>
<p><strong>#1 An Emergency Fund</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/backyardliberty.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-k0NQ-rOJPq0/UPDSF5crnFI/AAAAAAAATcw/i7Q6pBk-hoQ/s200/BL_013-200.gif"></a>Do you remember what happened when the financial system almost  collapsed back in 2008?  Millions of Americans suddenly lost their jobs,  and because many of them were living paycheck to paycheck, many of them  also got behind on their mortgages and lost their homes.  You don’t  want to lose everything that you have worked for during this next major  economic downturn.  It is imperative that you have an emergency fund.   It should be enough to cover all of your expenses for at least six  months, but I would encourage you to have an emergency fund that is even  larger than that.</p>
<p><strong>#2 Don’t Put All Of Your Eggs Into One Basket</strong></p>
<p>If the wealth confiscation <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/tag/cyprus" title="in Cyprus">in Cyprus</a>  has taught us anything, it is that we should not put all of our eggs in  one basket.  If all of your money is in one single bank account, it  would be easy to wipe out.  But if you have your money scattered around a  number of different places it will give you a little bit more security.</p>
<p><strong>#3 Keep Some Cash At Home</strong><br />
This goes along with the previous point.  While it is not wise to  keep all of your money at home, you do want to keep some cash on hand.   If there is an extended bank holiday or if a <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/a-massive-electromagnetic-pulse-could-collapse-the-economy-in-a-single-moment" title="giant burst from the sun">giant burst from the sun</a>  causes the ATM machines to go down, you want to be able to have enough  cash to buy the things that your family needs.  Just ask the people of  Cyprus how crippling a bank holiday can be.  One way to keep your cash  secure at home is by storing it in a concealed safe.</p>
<p><strong>#4 Get Out Of Debt</strong></p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>A lot of people seem to assume that an economic collapse would wipe  out all debts, but that will probably not be the case.  In fact, if you  are in a tremendous amount of debt you will be very vulnerable if the  economy collapses and you are not able to find a job.  Just ask the  people who were overextended and lost their jobs during the last  recession.  So please get out of debt.  Many debt collectors are  becoming increasingly ruthless.  In many areas of the country they are  now routinely putting debtors <a href="http://jonathanturley.org/2013/04/07/the-rise-of-debtors-prisons-in-the-us/#more-62701" target="_blank" title="into prison">into prison</a>.  You do not want to be a <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/money-is-a-form-of-social-control-and-most-americans-are-debt-slaves" title="slave to debt">slave to debt</a> when the next wave of the economic collapse strikes.</p>
<p><strong>#5 Gold And Silver</strong></p>
<p>In the long-term, the U.S. dollar is going to lose a tremendous  amount of value and inflation is going to absolutely skyrocket.  That is  one reason why so many people are investing very heavily in gold,  silver and other precious metals.  All over the globe, the central banks  of the world are recklessly printing money.  Everyone knows that this  is going to end very badly.  In fact, there is already a push <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-08/trust-in-gold-not-bernanke-as-u-s-states-promote-bullion.html" target="_blank" title="in more than a dozen U.S. states">in more than a dozen U.S. states</a>  to allow gold and silver coins to be used as legal tender.  Someday you  will be glad that you invested in gold and silver now while their  prices were still low.</p>
<p><strong>#6 Reduce Your Expenses</strong></p>
<p>A lot of people claim that they can’t put any money toward prepping,  but the truth is that we all have room to reduce our expenses.  We all  spend money on things that we do not really need.  Those that are “lean  and mean” will tend to do much better during the times that are coming.</p>
<p><strong>#7 Start A Side Business</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.bloggersecret.com/" style="clear: left;float: left;margin-bottom: 0em;margin-right: 1em"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-W_QDsMeuL2M/T8kFjUwCVXI/AAAAAAAAPEk/RT2DHTDyOsI/s300/300x250_v002.gif" width="200"></a>If you do not have much money, a great way to increase your income is  by starting a side business.  And it does not take a lot of money –  there are many side businesses that you can start for next to nothing.   </p>
<p>And starting a side business will allow you to become less dependent on  your job.</p>
<p>In this economic environment, a job could disappear at  literally any time.</p>
<p><strong>#8 Move Away From The Big Cities If Possible</strong></p>
<p>For many people, this is simply not possible.  Many Americans are  still completely and totally dependent on their jobs.  But if you are  able, now is a good time to move away from the big cities.  When the  next major economic downturn strikes, there will be rioting and a  dramatic rise in crime in the major cities.  If you are able to move to a  more rural area you will probably be in much better shape.</p>
<p><strong>#9 Store Food</strong></p>
<p>Global food reserves have reached their lowest level <a href="http://thetruthwins.com/archives/global-food-reserves-have-reached-their-lowest-level-in-almost-40-years" target="_blank" title="in nearly 40 years">in nearly 40 years</a>.   As the economy gets even worse and global weather patterns become even  more unstable, the price of food will go much higher and global food  supplies will become much tighter.  In the long run, you will be glad  for the money that you put into long-term food storage now.</p>
<p><strong>#10 Learn To Grow Your Own Food</strong></p>
<p>This is a skill that most Americans possessed in the past, but that  most Americans today have forgotten.  Growing your own food is a way to  become more independent of the system, and it is a way to get prepared  for what is ahead.</p>
<p><strong>#11 Nobody Can Survive Without Water</strong></p>
<p>Without water, you would not even make it a few days in an emergency  situation.  It is imperative that you have a plan to provide clean  drinking water for your family when disaster strikes.</p>
<p><strong>#12 Have A Plan For When The Grid Goes Down</strong></p>
<p>What would you do if the grid went down and you suddenly did not have  power for an extended period of time?  Anyone that has spent more than a  few hours without power knows how frustrating this can be.  You need to  have a plan for how you are going to provide power to your home that is  independent of the power company.</p>
<p><strong>#13 Have Blankets And Warm Clothing On Hand</strong></p>
<p>This is more for emergency situations or for a complete meltdown of  society.  During any major crisis, blankets and warm clothing are in  great demand.  They also could potentially make great barter items.</p>
<p><strong>#14 Store Personal Hygiene Supplies</strong></p>
<p>A lot of preppers store up huge amounts of food, but they forget all  about personal hygiene supplies.  During a long crisis, these are items  that you would greatly miss if you do not have them stored up.  These  types of supplies would also be great for barter.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/backyardliberty.html" rel="nofollow" style="float: right;margin-bottom: 0em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-S6RfjP7Lvo8/USlEmRqWjJI/AAAAAAAAUgk/Zio_5z2T_gE/s200/prep.gif"></a><strong>#15 Store Medicine And Medical Supplies</strong></p>
<p>You will also want to store up medical supplies and any medicine that  you may need.  In an emergency situation, you definitely would not want  to be without bandages and a first-aid kit.  Over the course of a long  crisis, you do not want to run out of any medicines that are critical  for your health.</p>
<p><strong>#16 Stock Up On Vitamins</strong></p>
<p>A lot of preppers do not think about this either, but it is very  important.  These days, it is becoming increasingly difficult to get  adequate nutrition from the foods that we eat.  That is why it is very  important to have an adequate store of vitamins and other supplements.</p>
<p><strong>#17 Make A List Of Other Supplies That You Will Need</strong></p>
<p>During any crisis, there will be a lot of other things that you will  need in addition to food and water.  The following are just a few basic  things that it would be wise to have on hand…</p>
<p>– an axe<br />
– a can opener<br />
– flashlights<br />
– battery-powered radio<br />
– extra batteries<br />
– lighters or matches<br />
– fire extinguisher<br />
– sewing kit<br />
– tools</p>
<p>This list could be much, much longer, but hopefully this will get you started.</p>
<p><strong>#18 Don’t Forget The Special Needs Of Your Babies And Your Pets</strong></p>
<p>Young children and pets have special needs.  As you store supplies, don’t forget about the things that they will need as well.</p>
<p><strong>#19 Entertainment</strong></p>
<p>This may sound trivial, but the truth is that our  entertainment-addicted society would become very bored and very  frustrated if the grid suddenly went down for an extended period of  time.  Card games and other basic forms of entertainment can make  enduring a crisis much easier.</p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p><strong>#20 Self-Defense</strong></p>
<p>In the years ahead, being able to defend your home and your family is  going to become increasingly important.  When the economy crashes,  people are going to start to become very desperate.  And desperate  people do desperate things.</p>
<p><strong>#21 Get Your Ammunition While You Still Can</strong></p>
<p>Your firearms will not do you much good if you do not have ammunition  for them.  Already there are widespread reports of huge ammunition  shortages.  The following is from a recent <a href="http://www.cnsnews.com/blog/gregory-gwyn-williams-jr/ammo-manufacturers-scramble-keep-demand-reassure-eager-customers" target="_blank" title="CNS News article">CNS News article</a>…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“The run on ammunition has manufacturers scrambling to  accommodate demand and reassure customers, as many new and seasoned gun  owners stock up over fears of new firearms regulations at both the state  and federal levels.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Don’t just assume that you will always be able to purchase large  amounts of ammunition whenever you want.  Get it now while you still  can.</p>
<p><strong>#22 If You Have To Go…</strong></p>
<p>Have a plan for what you and your family will do if you are forced to  leave your home.  If you do have to go, the following are some items  that you will want to have on hand…</p>
<p>– a map of the area<br />
– a compass<br />
– backpacks for every member of the family<br />
– sleeping bags<br />
– warm clothing<br />
– comfortable shoes or hiking boots</p>
<p><strong>#23 Community</strong></p>
<p>One of the most important assets in any crisis situation is  community.  If you have friends or neighbors that you can depend upon,  that is invaluable.  The time spent building those bonds now will pay  off greatly during a major crisis.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/crisis/" rel="nofollow" style="clear: left;float: left;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-right: 1em"><img alt="" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-OZxCqDIzHoc/UG41ytTUvHI/AAAAAAAAR9w/JBjP0gAZV14/s225/225.jpg"></a><strong>#24 Have A Back-Up Plan And Be Flexible</strong></p>
<p>Mike Tyson once said the following…</p>
<p>“Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.”</p>
<div class="code-block code-block-1" style="margin: 0px">
<div align="center" class="mrf-external">
<a href="https://amorain.com/?E=ikLQsSIi%2fgaXBh0SRK5s8g%3d%3d&amp;s1="><img src="https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/500.jpg"></a></p>

</div>
<p>No plan ever unfolds perfectly.  When your plan is disrupted, what will you do?</p>
<p>It will be imperative for all of us to have a back-up plan and to be flexible during the years ahead.</p>
<p><strong>#25 Keep Your Prepping To Yourself</strong></p>
<p>Do not go around and tell everyone in the area where you live about  your prepping.  If you do, then you may find yourself overwhelmed with  “visitors” when everything falls apart.</p>
<p>And please do not go on television and brag about your prepping to a national audience.</p>
<p>Prepping is something that you want to keep to yourself, unless you  want hordes of desperate people banging on your door in the future.</p>
<p>For much more on prepping, please check out some of my previous articles…</p>

<p>Sadly, most Americans still have blind faith that our “leaders”  actually know what they are doing and will be able to fix things.</p>
<p>Most Americans still are convinced that everything is going to be just fine.</p>
<p>And of course the mainstream media does all they can to reinforce  faith in the system.  Day after day, we see mindless news headlines such  as this: “<a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/100624456" target="_blank" title="Californians Champing at the Bit Over Powerball Debut">Californians Champing at the Bit Over Powerball Debut</a>“.</p>
<p>But if you are reading this article that means that you are probably much more awake than the average American is.</p>
<p>Please get prepared while you still can.</p>
<p>A great storm is coming, and time is quickly running out.</p>

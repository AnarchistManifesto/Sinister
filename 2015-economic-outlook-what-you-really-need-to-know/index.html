<a href="http://www.caseyresearch.com/go/ukehn-2/ATP"><b>Casey Research</b></a></p>
<p>In the January issue of <i><a href="http://www.caseyresearch.com/go/uk5cx-2/ATP">BIG GOLD</a></i>, I interviewed 17 analysts,  economists, and authors on what they expect for gold in 2015. Some of  those included what we affectionately call our Casey Brain Trust—Doug  Casey, Olivier Garret, Bud Conrad, David Galland, Marin Katusa, Louis  James, and Terry Coxon. The issue was so popular that we decided to  reprint this portion.</p>
<p>I think you’ll find some very insightful and useful reading here (click on a link to read his bio)…</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><b><a href="http://www.caseyresearch.com/go/uke7q-2/ATP">Doug Casey, Chairman</a></b><b> </b></p>
<p><b>Jeff: </b>The Fed and other central banks have kept the  economy and markets propped up longer than you thought they could. Has  the Fed succeeded in staving off crisis?</p>
<p><b>Doug:</b> I’m genuinely surprised things have held  together over the last year. The trillions of currency units created  since 2007 have mostly inflated financial assets, creating bubbles  everywhere. There’s an excellent chance that the bubble will burst this  year. I don’t know whether it will result in a catastrophic deflation,  extreme inflation, or both in sequence. I’m only sure it will result in  chaos and extreme unpleasantness.</p>
<p><b>Jeff:</b> Are we still going to get rich from gold stocks? Or should we face reality and start exiting?</p>
<p><b>Doug:</b> The fact so many people are discouraged with  gold and mining stocks is just another indicator that we’re at the  bottom. Gold and silver are now, once more, superb speculations. And I  think we’ll see some 10-to-1 shots in gold stocks—if not this year, then  2016. I can afford to wait with those kinds of returns in prospect.</p>

<p><b><a href="http://www.caseyresearch.com/go/ukesr-2/ATP">Olivier Garret, CEO</a></b><b> </b></p>
<p><b>Jeff:</b> The crash in the general markets we warned about  didn’t materialize. Have those risks dissipated, or should we still  expect to see a major correction?</p>
<p><b>Olivier:</b> Last October the risk of a very severe market  correction was indeed very serious; hence our call to subscribers to  batten down the hatches, tighten their portfolios, and have cash and  gold on hand. We warned of further downturn across all commodities,  including oil. We also highlighted the dollar would be strong and that  an excellent short-term speculation was to be long 10- to 30-year  Treasuries, as they would be considered a safe haven.</p>
<p>Let’s look at where we are today. Clearly, the S&amp;P did not extend  its correction after its initial dip in mid-October. In light of the  possibility of a perfect storm coming, the Fed announced that it may not  end QE in early 2015 as anticipated if the economy failed to continue  to pick up. Then the Bank of Japan announced its version of QE infinity,  followed by the largest Japanese pension fund’s decision to invest in  equities worldwide.</p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>The bulls were reassured and came back with a vengeance; the crash was  averted. That said, fundamentals are still very weak, and market growth  is concentrated within the largest-cap stocks. Mid- and small-caps are  hurting, and many economic indicators are still concerning.</p>
<p><b>Jeff:</b> What about lower energy prices—aren’t these good for the economy?</p>
<p><b>Olivier:</b> In theory, yes. In practice, there is another  crisis brewing. Most of the development of new shale resources in the  US has been financed by debt based on oil prices of $80 and above. This  easy debt was immediately securitized, just like home mortgages were in  2003-2006, and we have a monstrous bubble about to pop with oil around  $55. The potential risk of another derivative crisis is as high or  higher than in 2007.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/backyardliberty.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 0em;margin-left: 1em"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-k0NQ-rOJPq0/UPDSF5crnFI/AAAAAAAATcw/i7Q6pBk-hoQ/s200/BL_013-200.gif" alt=""></a><b>Jeff:</b> Does that mean the inevitable is imminent?</p>
<p><b>Olivier:</b> Maybe, maybe not. We know central bankers  will do whatever it takes to provide liquidity to the markets. That  said, I do not believe central bankers are wizards endowed with  supernatural powers that enable them to stem all crises. Bernanke told  us in 2007 and 2008 that there was no real estate crisis and that he had  everything under control—will Janet Yellen be better?</p>
<p>My view is that our subscribers should be prepared for the worst and  hope for the best. Sacrifice a bit of performance for safety, and use  money you can afford to lose to speculate on opportunities that could  bring outsized upside. I believe subscribers should continue to hold  cash (in dollars), gold (the ultimate hedge against crisis), and stocks  in best-of-breed companies that are unlikely to collapse during a  financial meltdown.</p>
<p>For speculations, I still believe that we should be invested in the  best gold producers, in well-managed explorers with good management and  first-class resources, in long-term Treasuries, and top-quality tech  companies.</p>
<p><b>Jeff:</b> As a former turnaround professional, what would signal to you that the gold market is about to turn around?</p>
<p><b>Olivier:</b> Two things: market capitulation, and  valuations for the best companies not seen in decades. The cure for low  prices is low prices.</p>
<p>Cyclical markets <i>do</i> turn around, and I would rather buy low  and hold on until the market turns around than buy in the later stage of  a bull market. At this point, the gold market presents amazing value  for the patient investor. In my opinion, that is all that matters. The  gold market may take longer than I want to turn around, but I know I am  near an all-time low.</p>
<p><b><a href="http://www.caseyresearch.com/go/ukevs-2/ATP">Bud Conrad, Chief Economist</a></b><b> </b></p>
<p><b>Jeff:</b> What role do big banks and government currently play in gold’s behavior? Is this role here to stay?</p>
<p><b>Bud:</b> I’ve looked at the huge demand for gold from  China, Russia, India, and private investors and been surprised the price  has eroded over the last three years. My explanation is that the “paper  gold futures market” sets the price of gold, with very little physical  gold being traded. There are two parts of futures market trading: one is  the minute-by-minute trading of only paper contracts that dominate 99%  of the trading, in which every long position is matched by a short  position. That is why the futures market is called “paper gold.” Almost  all trades are unwound and rolled over to another contract. Only a few  thousand contracts are held into the second process, called the  “delivery process.” Just a handful of big banks dominate that delivery  process, so they are in a position to affect the market. There is  surprisingly little physical gold used in the delivery process compared  to the 200,000 ongoing paper trading of the contracts not yet in  delivery every day, where no physical gold is used.</p>
<p>Big players can place huge orders to move the “paper price” for a short  term, but eventually 99% of these paper positions are unwound before  delivery, so their effect in the longer term is canceled. The delivery  process is the only time where physical gold is actually sold  (delivered) or purchased (stopped). The gold price can be influenced in  one direction in this process by bringing gold to the market from their  own account (or the reverse).</p>
<p>Big banks gain a big benefit from the Fed driving their borrowing rate  to zero with the QE policy. Banks lend that money at higher rates and  have become very profitable. If gold were soaring, then the Fed would be  less inclined to keep rates low, as it would be concerned that the  dollar is purchasing less and inflation is returning. So banks are happy  to have the gold price contained so the Fed is more likely to keep  rates low.</p>
<div align="center"><img alt="" src="https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/ThreeBanksHandled90PercentofDecemberGoldDelivery1.png" style="height: auto;max-width: 540px;width: 100%" width="540"></div>
<p>
The above chart shows that in the delivery process for the December  2014 contract, only three banks—JP Morgan, Bank of Nova Scotia, and  HSBC—handled most of the transactions. Big banks can act as either  traders for other customers or as trading for the banks themselves in  their in-house account. In the December contract, 90% of the gold was  purchased by HSBC and JP Morgan for themselves, and Bank of Nova Scotia  provided over half of the gold from its in-house account. With so few  players, the delivery market is prone to being dominated and price being  set.</p>
<p><b>Jeff:</b> So if the big players influence the market, why should we own gold?</p>
<p><b>Bud:</b> I see the regulators issuing big fines to banks  who have been caught manipulating foreign exchange, LIBOR, and even the  London Gold Fix (which is being changed) as evidence that the methods  used to influence the futures market will be curtailed by the  regulators. So gold will become the recognized alternative to paper  money issued in excessive amounts to fix whatever problems the  governments want.</p>
<p>I also see the collapse of the petrodollar as leaving all currencies in  limbo, which will lead to big swings in the currency wars, where  ultimately gold will be the winner. Governments themselves are  recognizing the value of gold, as I’m sure Russia does after the ruble  collapsed in half since last summer.</p>
<p><b><a href="http://www.caseyresearch.com/go/ukeyt-2/ATP">David Galland, Partner</a></b><b> </b></p>
<p><b>Jeff:</b> What personal benefits have you achieved from living in Argentina?</p>
<p><b>David:</b> Most important, my stress levels have fallen  significantly. Even though I wouldn’t consider myself a high-stress  type, I used to be on meds for moderately high blood pressure and for  acid reflux… both of which I take as signs of stress. After a few months  back in Cafayate, I am med-free.</p>
<p>Second, living in the Argentine outback provides perspective on what  actually matters in life. Life in Cafayate is very laid back, with time  for siestas, leisurely meals, and any number of enjoyable activities  with agreeable company. There is none of the ceaseless dosing of bad  news that permeates Western cultures. After a week of unplugging, you  realize that most of what passes as important or urgent back in the US  is really just a charade.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/familysurvival.html" rel="nofollow" style="float: right;margin-left: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ASIFGy_z7zU/UCFiDQK8GBI/AAAAAAAAROU/7AHejVY_hUE/s202/3.gif"></a>Finally, my personal sense of freedom soars, as life in rural Argentina is very much live and let live.<br />
In sharp contrast, returning to the USA for even a short visit reveals  the national moniker “land of the free” as blatant hypocrisy. There are  laws against pretty much everything, and worse, a no-strikes willingness  to enforce them. That a person can get mugged by a group of police over  selling loose cigarettes tells you pretty much everything you need to  know.</p>
<p><b>Jeff:</b> Gold and gold stocks have been hammered. What would you say to those precious metals investors sitting on losses?</p>
<p><b>David:</b> I doubt anything anyone can say will prove a  panacea for the pain some have suffered, but I do have some thoughts.  Like many of our readers, I have taken big losses as well, but because I  have long believed in moderation in most things, especially the  juniors, I have taken those losses only on smallish positions.</p>
<p>Specifically, about 20% of our family portfolio is in resource  investments, with about half in the stocks and the rest held as an  insurance position in the physical metals, diversified internationally.  So a 70% loss on 10% of our portfolio, while painful, is not the end of  the world.</p>
<p>I guess my primary message would be to continue to view the sector for  what it is: physical metals for insurance, and moderate positions in the  stocks—big and small—as speculative investments.</p>
<p>I remain convinced the massive government manipulations that extend  into all the major markets must eventually begin to fail, at which time  investors will come back into the resource sector in droves. When the  worm begins to turn, I anticipate the physical metals will recover  first—and $1,200 gold is starting to look like a fairly solid  foundation. The <i><a href="http://www.caseyresearch.com/go/uk5cx-2/ATP">BIG GOLD</a></i> companies, which I’m starting to personally get interested in, will rally soon thereafter.</p>
<p>When the producers decisively break through resistance levels on the upside, it will be time to refocus on the best juniors.</p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>But regardless, per my first comment, while these stocks can offer  life-changing returns, being highly selective and moderate in the size  of your positions is the right approach. Then you can sit tight and wait  for the market to prove you right.</p>
<p><b><a href="http://www.caseyresearch.com/go/uk5ju-2/ATP">Marin Katusa, Chief Energy Investment Strategist</a></b><b> </b></p>
<p><b>Jeff: </b>I loved your book <a href="http://www.caseyresearch.com/go/uk5nv-2/ATP" target="_blank"><i>The Colder War</i></a>.  And I liked your concluding recommendation to buy gold. Are events  playing out as you expected? And does the fall in the oil price change  the game at all?</p>
<p><b>Marin:</b> First off, thank you. A lot of personal time  was spent completing the book. And yes, most of the events are playing  out as expected in the book. I expect this trend to continue over the  next decade, as the Colder War will take many years to play out.</p>
<p>As I stated to all our energy subscribers and to attendees at the last  Casey Conference in San Antonio, we expected a significant drop in oil  prices, but it has happened a lot faster than I expected. I think we  will continue to see volatility in oil; we’ll probably get a rally to  the mid-$60s for WTI, but I think it will hit $45 before January 1,  2016.</p>
<p>This definitely makes Putin’s strategy harder to implement—but we are  in the Colder War, not the Colder Battle, and wars are made of many  battles. Putin’s strategy is still being implemented, and it will play  out over many years.</p>
<p><b>Jeff:</b> You’re calling for the end of the petrodollar  system. This is very bullish for gold, but won’t that process take many  years? Or should investors buy gold now?</p>

<p><b>Marin:</b> The process is well underway, and yes, as I  point out in the book, the demise of the petrodollar will take many  years—but it will happen.</p>
<p>Each investor must evaluate his position and situation, but I don’t  believe anyone knows when the bottom in gold will happen, and I see gold  as insurance. You never know exactly when you need health insurance,  but speaking from personal experience, it’s good to have, and good to  have as much as you can afford, because when you need it, trust me, you  won’t regret it.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/alive.html" rel="nofollow" style="float: right;margin-left: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-UnTVTgexxnw/U5S_OusDWEI/AAAAAAAAArc/BVJwH5q6qsU/s220/300x250d9004b49-3493-48a8-bff1-0f843d224352.jpg" alt=""></a>Resources are in the “valley of darkness” right now—but this is part of  the cycle. The key is portfolio survival. If you can get to the other  side, the riches will be much greater than you can fathom. I’m speaking  from personal experience. I’ve been through this before, and while it  was stressful, what happened on the other side blew away my own  expectations. We are in a cyclical business, and this bottom trend has  been nasty—longer and lower than most have expected—but I am excited,  because this is what I have been waiting for and what will take my net  worth to a new level.</p>
<p>I see no difference in the outcome for yourself, Louis James, and all  of those who follow you and survive to the other side. I believe there  will be significant upside in gold stocks, especially certain junior  gold explorers and developers. Subscribers are in good hands with you  and Louis in that regard, and I always read my <i><a href="http://www.caseyresearch.com/go/uk5cx-2/ATP">BIG GOLD</a></i> and <i><a href="http://www.caseyresearch.com/go/uk5fy-2/ATP">International Speculator</a></i>  when I get the email, regardless of where I am—the most recent being in  an airport in Mexico. Keep up the great work, Jeff; even though it’s a  difficult market, you’re doing the right things. It will pay off—maybe  not on our desired schedules, but it will pay off.</p>
<p><b><a href="http://www.caseyresearch.com/go/uk5rw-2/ATP">Louis James, Chief Metals &amp; Mining Investment Strategist</a></b><b> </b></p>
<p><b>Jeff</b><b>:</b> The junior resource sector  tends to progress in cycles. Is the current down cycle about over, or  should investors expect the recovery to drag out for several more years?</p>
<p><b>L:</b> That’s essentially a market-timing  question—literally the million-dollar question we all wish we could  answer definitively. That’s not an option, and I’m sure your readers  know better than to listen to anyone who claims to be able to time the  market with any precision or reliability.</p>
<p>That said, I don’t want to dodge the question; for what it’s worth,  Doug Casey and I both feel that gold has likely bottomed. Yes, it’s true  that I felt that December 2013 was the bottom—but it’s also true that  most of our stocks are up since then. So, gold may have put in a double  bottom, but our stocks outperformed the metal and the market.</p>
<p>Either way, if we’re right, the next big move should be upward, and that’s as good for <i>BIG GOLD</i> readers as it is for <i><a href="http://www.caseyresearch.com/go/uk5fy-2/ATP">International Speculator</a></i> readers.</p>
<p>I should also add that precious metals are not just “resources”—gold is  money, not a regular commodity like pork bellies or corn. It’s the  world’s most tested and trusted means of preserving wealth. So even  though resource commodities tend to move as a group in cycles, gold and  silver can be expected to act differently during times of crisis.</p>
<p>And 2015 looks fraught with crises to me… I am cautiously quite bullish for this year.</p>
<p><b>Jeff:</b> Where will gold speculators get the biggest bang for their buck in 2015?</p>
<p><b>L:</b> If you mean when, statistically the first and  fourth quarters of the year tend to be the strongest for gold, making  now a good time to buy.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/expatguide.html" rel="nofollow" style="float: left;margin-right: 1em;margin-bottom: 0em"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/_qLAIskTQXUc/TZ9QqThBpRI/AAAAAAAAIG0/1ea27Wk9TKA/USam200.jpg" alt=""></a>As to what to buy, it depends on whether you want to maximize potential  gains or minimize risk. The most conservative move is to stick with  bullion, which is not a speculation at all, but a sort of forex deal in  search of safety. For more leverage with the least amount of added risk,  there’s the best of the larger, more stable producers that you  recommend in <i><a href="http://www.caseyresearch.com/go/uk5cx-2/ATP" target="_blank">BIG GOLD</a></i>. For greater wealth-creation potential, as opposed to wealth preservation, there are the junior stocks I follow in the <i><a href="http://www.caseyresearch.com/go/uk5fy-2/ATP" target="_blank">International Speculator</a></i>.</p>
<p>As to where in the world to invest, I’d say it’s easier to get in on  the ground floor investing in an exploration or development company  working in less well-known countries—you always pay more of a premium  for North American projects where the rule of law is well established.  That’s obviously riskier too, but that doesn’t mean you have to go to a  kleptocratic regime with a history of nationalization. There are stable  places off most investors’ radars, like Ireland and Scandinavia. Africa  plays may be oversold in the wake of the Ebola outbreak, but that story  isn’t done yet, so even I am waiting before going long there again.<br />
<b><br />
<a href="http://www.caseyresearch.com/go/uk52z-2/ATP">Terry Coxon, Senior Economist</a></b><b> </b></p>
<p><b>Jeff: </b>In<b> </b>spite of profligate money printing over the  past six years, there’s been minimal inflation. Should we give up on  this notion that money printing causes inflation?</p>
<p><b>Terry:</b> No, you shouldn’t. As Milton Friedman put it,  the lags between changes in the money supply and changes in prices are  “long and variable.” I’m surprised we haven’t yet seen the inflationary  effects of a better than 60% increase in the M1 money supply. But the  Federal Reserve has essentially guaranteed that those effects are  coming, since they are committed to keep printing until price inflation  shows up. And when it does appear, the delayed effects of all the money  creation that has occurred to date will start to take hold. There won’t  be “just a little” inflation.</p>
<p><b>Jeff:</b> What do you watch to tell you the next gold bull market is about to get underway?</p>
<p><b>Terry:</b> Beats me. I won’t know it is happening until  it’s already started. But because high inflation rates are already baked  in the cake, so is another strong period for gold. That’s a reason to  own gold now, and the reason is compelling if you believe, as I do, that  there’s little downside. At this point, given the metal’s weak  performance since 2011, virtually everyone who lacks a clear  understanding of the reason for owning it has already sold. So it’s safe  to buy.</p>

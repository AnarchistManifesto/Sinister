<p>The terms insurgency and counterinsurgency can quickly become  confusing in a politically motivated context. However, generally  speaking, an insurgency seeks to overthrow an established institution or  political order, while a counterinsurgency seeks to maintain that order.</p>
<p>In the United States, and around much of  the world where the nation-state still prevails, the established order  is one of national sovereignty based on constitutions and charters  produced by each respective nation, with an infrastructure built and  improved upon over generations by each nation’s respective cultures,  economic activities, and innovations. There is an insurgency to subvert  all of this. A global <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/?p=20431">corporate-financier</a> insurgency, or simply a  “corporate-insurgency.”</p>
<p>The corporate-insurgency seeks  to subvert our institutions, starting with the family, extending to our  schools, universities, churches, temples and mosques, our local sheriff, and even reaching  into our national governments, rewriting or eradicating altogether our  national constitutions and charters.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>It has, to a great extent, already  subverted our independent local infrastructure, while implementing laws  and regulations to prevent us from restoring it.</p>
<p>We have the very  tactics described in a vast library of government and military counterinsurgency  documents being deployed against us, whereever we are and to a profound  effect.</p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>Insurgency is the  organized use of subversion and violence to seize, nullify or challenge  political control of a region. As such, it is primarily a political  struggle, in which both sides use armed force to create space for their  political, economic and influence activities to be effective. Insurgency  is not always conducted by a single group  with  a  centralized,   military-style command  structure,  but  may  involve  a complex matrix  of different actors with various aims, loosely connected in dynamic and  non-hierarchical networks. To be successful, insurgencies require  charismatic leadership, supporters, recruits, supplies, safe havens and  funding (often from illicit activities). They only need the active  support of a few enabling individuals, but the passive acquiescence of a  large proportion of the contested population will give a higher  probability of success. This is best achieved when the political cause  of the insurgency has  strong  appeal,  manipulating religious, tribal  or  local identity to exploit common societal grievances or needs.  Insurgents seek to gain control of populations through a combination of  persuasion, subversion and coercion while using guerrilla tactics to  offset the strengths of government security forces. Their intent is  usually to protract the struggle, exhaust the government and win  sufficient popular support to force  capitulation or political  accommodation. Consequently, insurgencies evolve through a series of  stages, though the progression and outcome will be different in almost  every case.<i> –<a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/111163743/US-Government-Guide-to-Counterinsurgency"> page 7 U.S. Government Counterinsurgency Guide, 2009</a></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>While this above quote is a most accurate description of an insurgency, as one reads<a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/111163743/US-Government-Guide-to-Counterinsurgency"> the US Government Counterinsurgency Guide (2009)</a>,  they will realize that the opposing methods of counterinsurgency itself  involve all of these same factors, simply mirrored and reflecting the  interests of the US versus the interests of targeted “insurgencies.”</p>

<i><b>Image</b>:  The cover of the <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/111163743/US-Government-Guide-to-Counterinsurgency">US Government Counterinsurgency Guide (2009)</a> features  the signatures representing the trifecta of  modern day empire, covert  operations (USAID), military force (Department of Defense), and system  administration (<a href="https://www.activistpost.com/?p=20758">the State Department</a>). COIN describes the methods by  which empire is implemented at a grassroots level. </i></p>
<p>As  a matter of fact, what is described by the 2009 counterinsurgency  (COIN) guide, is an accurate description of how political control has  been achieved and maintained by all governments throughout the entirety  of human history – it also forms the foundation <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/?p=14092">of modern empire</a>.  Understanding this is key to finding solutions when one finds  themselves under the subjugation of an unfavorable political ideology or  system. The tactics the guide describes can, and often are, used by  either side in any political struggle, not necessarily only in an armed  “insurgency.” </p>
<p>COIN is a socioeconomic-tactical  synthesis, an interdisciplinary strategy based on an understanding of  how a society functions, how to organize human resources to multiple  force, and what needs and desires motivate individuals, as well as how  these can be manipulated  and controlled to collectively motivate a  society. These more technical concepts are generally absent from  everyday political discourse, and equally absent or incomplete in  regards to finding solutions for a failing or unfavorable system.</p>
<div style="font-family: inherit"><b>Insurgency and Counterinsurgency: How to Fight Back  </b></div>
<p>
While  the US Government COIN guide gives us a clear picture over the  governmental-military interdisciplinary aspects of COIN, the Marine  Corps Field Manual 3-24 (FM 3-24) provides us with a complete picture of  the actual components of an insurgency and all the relating factors  that affect it. This includes an enumerated list of services,  institutions, organizations, and processes that must be controlled in  order to establish political, tactical, and economic primacy. Without  these, counterinsurgency fails. Without these, any political movement  seeking to assert itself over a flawed or failing system, fails.  </p>

<div style="text-align: left">While  FM 3-24 deals with an armed insurgency, presumably in a foreign  country, the basic concepts can and are applied to the execution of real  political power throughout the world. The reason why so many well-intentioned political solutions  fall short, is because they are tailored without understanding these  basic concepts. </div>
<div style="text-align: left">
<b>1. Establishing Essential Services</b>
</div>
<div style="text-align: left">When  attempting to establish political primacy – essential services, basic  infrastructure, economic development and administration must all be  controlled by the counterinsurgency. It is upon these basic aspects of  modern society that people depend, and from which popular support is  sustainably derived. Strength in arms alone will fail utterly unless  these aspects are secured, controlled, and developed properly.

<div style="text-align: left">Upon page 117, the manual discusses the establishment or restoration of essential services. It states specifically:  </div>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<div style="text-align: left">Essential  services address the life support needs of the HN [host-nation] population. The U.S.  military’s primary task is normally to provide a safe and secure  environment. HN or interagency organizations can then develop the  services or infrastructure needed. In an unstable environment, the  military may initially have the leading role. Other agencies may not be  present or might not have enough capability or capacity to meet HN  needs. Therefore, COIN military planning includes preparing to perform  these tasks for an extended period.  </div>
</blockquote>
<div style="text-align: left">Any  goal, no matter how well-planned, noble, or progressive, cannot be  achieved before these basic services are established and capable of  being sustainably maintained. The military is a highly trained,  disciplined, well organized institution capable of developing,  maintaining, as well as protecting these services. In our local  communities around the world, we have to ask ourselves how we can  similarly develop and maintain these services sustainably.</p>
<p>The  task is not entirely as daunting as it may seem. Local communities  around the world accomplish this through a combination <a href="http://landdestroyer.blogspot.com/2012/09/tipping-balance-of-power.html">of traditional and newly created local institutions</a>.  Most local communities around the world operate with the added  advantage that the corporate-insurgency they face is low-intensity and  generally not armed. For prospective activists, auditing what their  communities already possess, and how to develop it to be more organized  and effective would be a good first step.</p>
<p>Some other initial priorities identified by the manual include the following taken from page 122: </p>
</div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both;text-align: center"><a href="https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/COIN_USMC_FM3_24_Page123diagram.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em;margin-right: 1em"><img border="0" height="173" src="https://lh3.ggpht.com/-BIOjg_SPrSU/UInO09yCZPI/AAAAAAAAE00/xaZc-xmBPFc/s640/COIN_USMC_FM3_24_Page123diagram.jpg" width="400"></a></div>
<p>Many communities already possess the ability to do these activities on  their own. Points such as “building an indigenous local security force”  might translate into efforts to empower local sheriff offices to negate  intrusive, unconstitutional federal government control. It might also  include the establishment of professional neighborhood watches and  shooting clubs where responsible gun ownership is taught. Building and  improving schools might translate into expanding and improving local  home schooling networks, leveraging freely available <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCourseWare">open-courseware online</a>,  and opening after-school tutoring centers giving remedial classes or  teaching trades and skills not taught at existing educational  institutions.<br />
<a href="http://activistpost.net/homeschoolguide.html" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" class="noshadow" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/_qLAIskTQXUc/TW61gkmHYeI/AAAAAAAAHPQ/fMnfpZ7Y9So/book1.png" style="border: none;background:none"></a><br />
Ultimately, most communities are not faced with absolute destitution.  For the most part, basic services exist. The problem really is that  these services are carried out in some cases by corporate-insurgents and  play an essential role in building legitimacy and a support base  dependent on the corporate-insurgency for these services. Therefore, the  goal should be to take ownership over the execution of these basic  services which can be done as a community effort or as a local, small  business. The precept of “boycott and replace” is the equivalent of the  “take, hold, and rebuild” doctrine in military “nation-building” and  counterinsurgency. </p>
<p><b>2. Economic Development </b></p>
<p>On page 119 of the report, it states the importance of expanding on  basic services and supporting economic development. It states  specifically: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The short-term aspect concerns immediate problems, such as large-scale  unemployment and reestablishing an economy at all levels. The long-term  aspect involves stimulating indigenous, robust, and broad economic  activity. The stability a nation enjoys is often related to its people’s  economic situation and its adherence to the rule of law. However, a  nation’s economic health also depends on its government’s ability to  continuously secure its population.  </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Planning economic development requires understanding the society,  culture, and operational environment. For example, in a rural society,  land ownership and the availability of agricultural equipment, feed, and  fertilizer may be the chief parts of any economic development plan. In  an urban, diversified society, the availability of jobs and the  infrastructure to support commercial activities may be more important.  Except for completely socialist economies, governments do not create  jobs other than in the public bureaucracy. However, the micro economy  can be positively stimulated by encouraging small businesses  development. Jump-starting small businesses requires micro finance in  the form of some sort of banking activities. So then, supporting  economic development requires attention to both the macro economy and  the <br />
micro economy.  </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Without a viable economy and employment opportunities, the public is  likely to pursue false promises offered by insurgents. Sometimes  insurgents foster the conditions keeping the economy stagnant.  Insurgencies attempt to exploit a lack of employment or job  opportunities to gain active and passive support for their cause and  ultimately undermine the government’s legitimacy. Unemployed males of  military age may join the insurgency to provide for their families.  Hiring these people for public works projects or a local civil defense  corps can remove the economic incentive to join the insurgency. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The report then goes on to list the major categories of economic  activity that it implies are essential for the counterinsurgency to  control: </p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both;text-align: center"><a href="https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/COIN_USMC_FM3_24_Page119diagram.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em;margin-right: 1em"><img border="0" height="182" src="https://lh3.ggpht.com/-G8_cApoVE-Y/UInOy40NF3I/AAAAAAAAE0s/_vd4ge3-lpo/s640/COIN_USMC_FM3_24_Page119diagram.jpg" width="400"></a></div>
<div style="text-align: left"></div>
<div style="text-align: left"></div>
<div style="text-align: left">Clearly all of these industries are dominated by the corporate-financier  oligarchs and their corporate-insurgency. One need not stretch their  imagination here to see how the economic crisis created by  corporate-financier interests across the West and spreading around the  world is comparable to the sort of economic challenges facing a post-war  nation fighting an armed insurgency.</p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

And, again, where the military possesses the ability and the resources to  do this on their own, or with other government institutions assisting –  local communities must develop their own institutions to accomplish  these same goals themselves. Hackerspaces and farmers’ markets represent  two organized efforts to develop economic opportunities locally, and  present viable models that can be expanded into other industries.</p>
<p><b>3. Logistics</b></p>
<p>An entire section of the counterinsurgency field manual is dedicated to  logistics. The importance of managing logistical lines not only enable  an army to conduct counterinsurgency operations efficiently, but deny  the insurgency supplies to conduct their operations. As it is pointed  out, throughout history, insurgencies many times supply themselves off  of carelessly protected counterinsurgency supply lines.</p>
<p>The report states on page 169: </p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>Insurgents have a long history of exploiting their enemies’ lines of  communications as  sources  of  supply.  During  the  Revolutionary   War,  American  forces  significantly provisioned  themselves  from   the  British  Army’s  overindulgent  and  carelessly  defended logistic  tail. In the 1930s, Mao Zedong codified a doctrine for insurgency  logistics during the fight against the Japanese occupation of China.  Without exaggerating,  Mao  stated,  ‘We  have  a  claim  on  the   output  of  the  arsenals  of  [our enemies],…and, what is more, it is  delivered to us by the enemy’s transport corps. This is the sober truth,  it is not a jest.’ For Mao’s forces, his enemy’s supply trains provided  a valuable source of supply. Mao believed the enemy’s rear was the  guerrillas’ front; the guerrillas’ advantage was that they had no  discernible logistic rear.  </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>This relative lack of logistic capacity was not an insurmountable  problem for Mao or one of his logistic theorists, Ming Fan. According to  Ming, “Weapons are not difficult to obtain. They can be purchased from  the people’s ‘self-preservation corps.’ Almost every home has some sort  of weapon that can be put to use.… Ammunition can be obtained in the  following ways: (1) From supplies given by friendly troops and  headquarters  on  higher  echelons.  (2)  Purchased  or  appropriated   from  the  people.  (3) Captured by ambushing enemy supply columns. (4)  Purchased undercover from the enemy army. (5) From salvage in combat  areas. (6) From the field of battle. (7) Self-made. (8) Manufactured by  guerrilla organizations. (Such items as hand grenades, ammunition,  etc.)” Beyond these specifics, this doctrine prescribes a mindset of  actively  seeking  parasitic  logistic  relationships  with  not  only   the  conventional  enemy forces that the insurgents seek to co-opt and  defeat but also active linkages to local black market activities and the  cultivation of host-nation sympathizers. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>For these reasons, forces conducting counterinsurgency operations must  protect all potential supplies. Forces must also vigorously protect  their lines of communications, scrupulously  collect  and  positively   control  dud  munitions  and  access  to  other  convertible materiel,  and actively seek ways  to separate insurgents from black market  activities.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The corporate-insurgency’s logistical lines are particularly easily to  compromise – that is because we the people are their logistical lines.  The corporate-financier oligarchy sustains itself from the collective  patronage of communities around the world failing to develop local  institutions, services, and economies, and instead pay into centralized,  monopolizing multinational corporations. By boycotting and replacing  these multinational corporations, <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/?p=16370">we cut the corporate-insurgency off entirely from its logistical lines</a>, starving it into submission. </p>
<p>But just as the USMC COIN manual implores counterinsurgency planners to  secure their logistical lines from pilfering insurgents, the  corporate-insurgency uses laws and regulations to protect their lines.</p>
<p>Laws and regulations are designed to prevent independent local  institutions, services, and economies from springing up and competing  directly with the corporate-insurgency.<a href="https://www.activistpost.com/?p=19499"> Farmers in America have been fighting</a>  laws seeking to disrupt and regulate out of business, local farmer’s  markets. Similar laws in regards to “intellectual property rights” seek  to stifle the emergence <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/?p=11154">of independent technological innovation and personal manufacturing</a>.  Understanding the greater implications of these laws should provide us a greater impetus to organize and find the means of  circumventing them.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/crisis/" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-mCnVdR3KeEE/UG5LXNMVjpI/AAAAAAAAR-Q/xgsm5bnQcsE/s200/01-200.gif"></a>For local communities organizing against the corporate-insurgency, our  “supplies” consist of our food and water, our electricity, our means of  communication, and many others.</p>
<p>To secure these, we must assume  ownership over them, maintaining them as a collective common or a small,  local business. To organize against the corporate-insurgency when we  are still dependent on them for even simple things like food and water,  is a recipe for instant and repeated failure.  </p>
<p><b>4. Communications</b></p>
<p>In a very literal sense, a local community’s communications include  telephone networks, the Internet, and radio. Like many other aspects of  fighting the corporate-insurgency, the low-intensity nature of it  affords us the ability to piecemeal boycott and replace various aspects  of its power structure without disrupting the lives of people in our  local community. In terms of communication infrastructure, ad hoc  wireless networks could be constructed to connect a local Internet. This  is already being done by the US State Department to infiltrate and  overthrow sovereign nation-states – they already recognize it as an  essential strategy of the corporate-insurgency.</p>
<p>In New York Times’ article, “<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/12/world/12internet.html?pagewanted=all">U.S. Underwrites Internet Detour Around Censors</a>,” it states: </p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>The Obama administration is leading a global effort to deploy ‘shadow’  Internet and mobile phone systems that dissidents can use to undermine  repressive governments that seek to silence them by censoring or  shutting down telecommunications networks.</p>
<p>The effort includes secretive projects to create independent cellphone  networks inside foreign countries, as well as one operation out of a spy  novel in a fifth-floor shop on L Street in Washington, where a group of  young entrepreneurs who look as if they could be in a garage band are  fitting deceptively innocent-looking hardware into a prototype ‘Internet  in a suitcase.’         </p>
</blockquote>
<p>With a well developed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace">community Hackerspace</a>,  a similar network can be created for a local community to simply  circumvent and replace corporate-financier monopolies, providing custom  tailored services for a community its creators already know, and  spreading the profits of communication monopolies across local  communities worldwide – a redistribution of wealth done not through  socialist handouts, but through innovative local entrepreneurship. A  larger international Internet could be made by simply providing links  between communities. </p>
<p>Community broadband initiatives are already popping up around the world  built around a similar premise. In Syracuse, New York, just such <a href="http://syracusebroadband.org/blog/106">an initiative headed by Seth Rutledge</a>, is working on this very project. In <a href="http://blog.syracuse.com/opinion/2012/06/broadband_initiative_broadens.html">this letter to his local paper</a>, Rutledge explains the benefits and necessity of taking ownership over the means of communication: </p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/ultimatesurvivalplan.html" style="float: right;margin-left: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em" target="_blank"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-CTsdDqKcvhI/T7GjToaksaI/AAAAAAAAO2s/8vEb9HmqOhk/s316/160x316.gif" alt=""></a>The Syracuse Community Broadband Initiative (SCBI) has received a  $15,000 grant to explore the economic viability of building a  state-of-the-art, fiber-optic broadband network for Syracuse. </p>
<p>The SCBI seeks to provide cable, Internet and phone service to residents  and businesses. The network would operate like a public utility  committed to the best service at the least cost, and would operate from  subscriber revenue independent of taxpayer subsidies. </p>
<p>The network could provide a much higher connection speed than is  currently available. It would have the capability to deliver an  unlimited number of on-demand channels, including high-definition  broadcasting and video conferencing for every subscriber via Internet  Protocol television (IPTV) technology. It could deliver a vastly  superior product at a much lower price. </p>

<p>Our local communications infrastructure is crucial to the social,  economic and democratic health of our community. It is equal in  importance to our public roads, schools and utility services. We are  foolish if we, as a community, do not take the lead in securing public  control of, and access to, our communications network. </p>
<p>It is not only possible and beneficial to develop local communication  alternatives, but an absolute necessity in order for people to reassert  themselves in a failing and unfavorable political system.</p>
<p>Communication also includes the media. In this regard, the  corporate-insurgency is already suffering serious defeat. It is finding  it increasingly difficult to maintain primacy over the political  narrative, or maintain popular support.</p>
<p>When countering the corporate-insurgency, every bit makes a difference, and starting a blog, Twitter, or  Facebook account with the expressed purpose of informing others of what  is going on locally, nationally, and internationally is both free and  easy to do. Even if the goal is to simply repost articles others write – these  efforts combined with others already active will make a significant  difference. </p>
<p>How far a media project goes depends solely on the amount of time and  effort one spends investing in it and the standards of objectivity and  intellectual honesty one holds themselves to. The alternative media is a  perfect example of a new “institution” and form of activism that has  already successfully begun to counter the corporate-insurgency, and it does so by  leveraging technology that allows us to do as individuals what was once  only possible with large, capital intensive organizations.</p>
<p>The alternative media also reflects some of the tactical considerations  expressed by the USMC COIN field manual in regards to logistics. By  using large corporate-owned, free services like Blogger, Facebook,  Twitter, YouTube, and others to spread a constructive message aimed at  developing our local communities, and against the corporate-insurgency,  we are essentially exploiting their own logistical trails for our cause.    </p>
<p><b>Conclusion </b></p>
<p>It must be understood that while, without taking these basic aspects  into consideration a political movement is sure to fail, this does not  by any means negate the work of activists focused in other areas. A  synergy must be created between all efforts aimed at unwarranted  corporate-financier influence – but these fundamentals must be  understood by all involved.</p>
<p>It must also be understood that not everyone employed or involved in a  large corporate-financier, multinational corporation is a bad person. In  fact, many people who work for corporations like Lockheed Martin,  Boeing, Halliburton, Exxon, and even Monsanto or Cargill are hardworking  and incredibly talented. Like many military who leave the service and  join the cause of humanity, these people can become some of our most  valued allies if and when they realize the greater implications of what  they are involved in and what, for their own best interests and those of  humanity, they must next do.</p>
<p>For our part, we must work hard to develop our local communities, to  create tangible solutions to the problems we face, superior local  alternatives to replace the dependency that empowers our opposition, and  produce a viable model that is self-evidently a system people will want  to join and help build.</p>
<p>Of all the aspects discussed in the voluminous collection of  counterinsurgency manuals the US government has produced, possessing a  morally superior cause and instilling a sense of legitimacy within a  population ranks toward the top in importance. Building a local  community with the people’s best interests addressed by the people’s own  two hands themselves, exhibits just such a cause, featuring just such  legitimacy. It would be a movement very difficult for the  corporate-insurgency to prevail against, and is the key reason why their  doctrine has failed them overseas in pursuit of their empire. </p>

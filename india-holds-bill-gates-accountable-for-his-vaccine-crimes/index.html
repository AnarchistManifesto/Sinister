<p>As Bill Gates faces a lawsuit for the illegal testing of tribal  children in India, it appears that his crimes against humanity have  finally caught up with him.</p>
<p>A recent report published by <i>Health Impact News</i> has reported  that the Gates Foundation has found itself facing a pending lawsuit,  due to an investigation that is being carried out by the Supreme Courts  of India.</p>
<p><i>Health Impact News</i> stated:</p>
<div style="padding-left: 30px">
<a name="more"></a>While fraud and corruption are  revealed on almost a daily basis now in the vaccine industry, the U.S.  mainstream media continues to largely ignore such stories. Outside the  U.S., however, the vaccine empires are beginning to crumble, and English  versions of the news in mainstream media outlets are available via the  Internet.</p>
<p>One such country is India, where the  Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and their vaccine empire are under  fire, including a pending lawsuit currently being investigated by the  India Supreme Court. [1]</p>
</div>
<p>
The <i>Health Impact News</i> article centered largely on a four-page report that was recently published by<i> Economic Times India</i>.</p>
<p>Eager to know more, I investigated their story and discovered that  the World Health Organization, the Gates Foundation and two  organizations funded by them, PATH (Program for Appropriate Technology  in Health) and GAVI (Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization),  have found themselves under fire, after a writ of petition originally  submitted to the Supreme Court of India, by Kalpana Mehta, Nalini Bhanot  and Dr. Rukmini Rao in 2012, was finally heard by the courts.</p>
<div align="left">
<ins class="adsbygoogle" style="height: 60px;margin-bottom: 1.5em;width: 468px"></ins></p>
<p>    <a href="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js">//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js</a><br />
    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || ).push({});
</div>
<p>The petitioners submitting the petition stated:</p>
<div style="padding-left: 30px">BMGF, PATH and WHO were criminally  negligent trialling the vaccines on a vulnerable, uneducated and  under-informed population school administrators, students and their  parents who were not provided informed consent or advised of potential  adverse effects or required to be monitored post-vaccination. [2]</div>
<p><b><br />
Young Tribal Girls Tested With HPV Vaccines</b></p>
<p>The <i>Economic Times India</i> published their report August 2014.  They stated that in 2009, tests had been carried out on 16,000 tribal  school children in Andhra Pradesh, India, using the human papiloma virus  (HPV) vaccine, Gardasil.</p>
<p>According to the report written by KP Narayana Kumar, within a month  of receiving the vaccine, many of the children fell ill and by 2010,  five of them had died. A further two children were reported to have died  in Vadodara, Gujarat, where an estimated 14,000 tribal children were  vaccinated with another brand of the HPV vaccine, Cervarix, manufactured  by GlaxoSmitheKline (GSK).</p>
<p>Shockingly, the report stated that many of the consent forms used to  vaccinate the girls were signed “illegally,” either by the wardens from  the hostels where many of the girls resided, or using thumbprints from  illiterate parents.</p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/vaccinetruth.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" height="175" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-38G3VOJQToQ/TfAZ2bc-qRI/AAAAAAAAJQ8/LA-TGAvVeWk/250x250-b.jpg" width="200"></a>This travesty was not discovered until a team of health activists  from the non-government organization SAMA, an organization specializing  in women’s health, decided to investigate what had been going on.</p>
<p>According to the report, they were shocked to discover that a total  of 120 girls had been taken ill, suffering from a variety of symptoms,  including “epileptic seizures, severe stomach aches, headaches and mood  swings.”</p>
<p>The <i>Economic Times</i> stated:</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>The Sama report also said there had  been cases of early onset of menstruation following the vaccination,  heavy bleeding and severe menstrual cramps among many students. The  standing committee pulled up the relevant state governments for the  shoddy investigation into these deaths. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>It said it was disturbed to find that  ‘all the seven deaths were summarily dismissed as unrelated to  vaccinations without in-depth investigations …’ the speculative causes  were suicides, accidental drowning in well (why not suicide?), malaria,  viral infections, subarachnoid hemorrhage (without autopsy) etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This information is even more shocking when you discover that the organization funding the study was none other than the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, who declared the project a total success.</p>
<p>Kumar wrote:</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>According to the BMGF, the WHO, the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics, and the Federation of Obstetric and Gynaecological Societies of India have all recommended vaccination ‘as a proven and highly effective preventive measure for cervical cancer.’ The project used vaccines that are licensed in India and that have been administered safely around the world tens of millions of times, preventing countless cases of cervical cancer illness and death, ‘maintains a BMGF spokesperson in an emailed response (see GAVI &amp; PHFI create incentives …’</p>
</blockquote>
<p> He continued:</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>BMGF’s role in funding the controversial studies, however, has led to many healthcare activists in India voicing their apprehensions. ‘BMGF has to take full responsibility because PATH is funded by them. It is also unethical when people championing the cause of vaccines are the same ones who are also investing in vaccine development,’ said V Rukmini Rao, one of the activists who filed a writ petition before the Supreme Court in connection with the HPV vaccine studies. [3]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Absolutely, and this is not the first time that these organizations have been caught illegally testing vaccines in developing countries.<b> </b></p>
<p><b>Gates Foundation, WHO, PATH, GAVI, UNICEF Behind Chad Vaccine Disaster</b></p>
<p>In December 2012, in the small village of Gouro, Chad, Africa,  situated on the edge of the Sahara Desert, five hundred children were  locked into their school, threatened that if they did not agree to being  force-vaccinated with a meningitis A vaccine, they would receive no  further education.<br />
These children were vaccinated without their parents’ knowledge. This  vaccine was an unlicensed product still going through the third and  fourth phases of testing.</p>
<p>Within hours, one hundred and six children began to suffer from  headaches, vomiting, severe uncontrollable convulsions and paralysis.  The children’s wait for a doctor began. They had to wait one full week  for a doctor to arrive while the team of vaccinators proceeded to  vaccinate others in the village.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/stepoutsidethebox.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: left;float: left;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-right: 1em"><img alt="" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-kADbI3spO2M/TwILKt_It9I/AAAAAAAANvU/F0N-dw_gGR4/s261/cancer.png"></a>When the doctor finally came, he could do nothing for the children.  The team of vaccinators, upon seeing what had happened, fled the village  in fear.</p>
<p>The original report written in a small, local newspaper called <i>La Voix</i>,  the only newspaper to have published the original story, stated that  forty children were finally transferred to a hospital in Faya and later  taken by plane to two hospitals in N’Djamena, the capital city of Chad.</p>
<div style="text-align: center">
</div>
<p>After being shuttled around like cattle, many of these sick, weak  children were finally dumped back in their village without a diagnosis  and each family was given an unconfirmed sum of £1000 by the government.  No forms were signed and no documentation was seen. They were informed  that their children had not suffered a vaccine injury.</p>
<p>However, if this were true, why would their government award each family £1000 in what has been described as hush money?</p>
<p>The only mainstream news channel to have highlighted the plight of  these poor children was a local channel called Tchad, which filmed  footage of the then-Prime Minister of Chad visiting the children in  hospital.</p>
<p>VacTruth has copies of both reports, along with medical and government documents.</p>
<p>Despite this evidence and VacTruth’s detailed and extensive coverage,  including highlighting television footage, once again, the vaccine  program was hailed a success. To watch videos reporting the story, see  the references at the end of this article. [4] [5]</p>
<p>The groups involved with this project were PATH, WHO, UNICEF, and the  Gates Foundation. During investigations, it was discovered that the  whole project was being run by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.</p>
<p>In a press release, the Gates Foundation stated:</p>
<div style="padding-left: 30px">MenAfriVac is a tremendous success  story for the global health community. It is the first vaccine developed  specifically for Africa, and it proves that global partnerships can  develop and deliver high-quality, low-cost vaccines.</p>
<p>Ten years ago, we invested in the  Meningitis Vaccine Project,  an innovative model that brought together  PATH, the World Health Organization, African health ministers and the  Serum Institute of India today, we celebrate the result: a modern  vaccine selling for less than US 50 cents per dose with the potential to  end Africa’s deadly meningitis epidemics.</p>
<p>We believe that vaccines are one of  the best buys in global health. In January, Bill and Melinda Gates  called on the global community to make this the Decade of Vaccines.  There is no better way to launch this decade than with a new vaccine  that will improve and save lives. [6]</p>

<p>
VacTruth can prove otherwise.<br />

Government Inquiry Holds GAVI Accountable for Multiple Deaths</b></p>
<p>Despite the fact the Gates Foundation call vaccines “one of the best  buys in global health,” a government inquiry in Pakistan has found the  complete opposite.</p>
<p>In 2011, the <i>Express Tribune</i> published a story stating that:</p>
<div style="padding-left: 30px">ISLAMABAD: A government inquiry has  found that polio vaccines for infants funded by the Global Alliance for  Vaccination and Immunisation are causing deaths and disabilities in  regional countries including Pakistan.</p>
<p>The startling revelation is part of  an inquiry report prepared by the Prime Minister’s Inspection Commission  (PMIC) on the working of the Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI).  The PMIC, headed by Malik Amjad Noon, has recommended that Prime  Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani immediately suspend the administration of  all types of vaccines funded by the GAVI.<br />

<p>According to the <i>Express Tribune</i>, the main vaccinations in  question were the polio vaccine and the 5-in-1 pentavelent vaccine,  which were said to be responsible for the deaths and disability of a  number of children in Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka, Bhutan and Japan.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/vaccineexempt.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 0em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-WfI77BHRfFg/TpHdZMZJHeI/AAAAAAAALS4/KDabWFqA1jM/s200/AVGLE2.0-CD.jpg"></a>The vaccines were funded by the Global Alliance for Vaccination and  Immunization (GAVI) an organization financed by the Bill and Melinda  Gates Children’s Vaccine Program, the International Federation of  Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, the Rockefeller Foundation,  the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the World Health  Organization (WHO) and the World Bank.<br />
Writing on the official report, made exclusive to the newspaper, the <i>Express Tribune</i> stated:</p>
<div style="padding-left: 30px">The report states, ‘<b>The procured vaccines are not tested in laboratories to confirm their efficacy and genuineness</b>. This leaves room for use of spurious and counterfeit vaccines.’ [7] (emphasis added)<br />
  </div>
<p>If this is true, then once again the Gates Foundation has been linked  to mass vaccination initiatives using untested, unsafe vaccinations.<br />
<b><br />
The Gates Foundation and WHO Labeled Unethical by Medical Experts</b></p>
<p>In 2012, Ramesh Shankar Mumbai, an author writing for the Pharmabiz  website, reported that two medical experts from India had accused the  Gates Foundation and WHO of being unethical.</p>
<p>In his report, Mumbai stated that Dr. Neetu Vashisht and Dr. Jacob  Puliyel of the Department of Pediatrics at St. Stephens Hospital in  Delhi, wrote the following information in their report in the April  issue of<i> Indian Journal of Medical Ethics</i>.</p>
<div style="padding-left: 30px">It was unethical for WHO and Bill  Gates to flog this program when they knew 10 years back that it was  never to succeed. Getting poor countries to expend their scarce  resources on an impossible dream over the last 10 years was unethical.<br />
  </div>
<p>Pharmabiz.com reported that Dr. Vashisht and Dr. Puliyel had continued their report by stating:</p>
<div style="padding-left: 30px">Another major ethical issue raised  by the campaign is the failure to thoroughly investigate the increase in  the incidence of non-polio acute flaccid paralysis (NPAFP) in areas  where many doses of vaccine were used. NPAFP is clinically  indistinguishable from polio paralysis but twice as deadly.<br />
  </div>
<div class="code-block code-block-1" style="margin: 0px">
<div align="center" class="mrf-external">
<a href="https://amorain.com/?E=ikLQsSIi%2fgaXBh0SRK5s8g%3d%3d&amp;s1="><img src="https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/500.jpg"></a></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center"><a href="https://amorain.com/?E=ikLQsSIi%2fgaXBh0SRK5s8g%3d%3d&amp;s1=" target="_blank">Secret $1.8 Million Cryptocurrency Script</a></h4>
</div>
<p>Pharmabiz.com continued:</p>
<div style="padding-left: 30px">The authors noted that while India  was polio-free in 2011, in the same year, there were 47500 cases of  NPAFP. While data from India’s National Polio Surveillance Project  showed NPAFP rate increased in proportion to the number of polio vaccine  doses received, independent studies showed that children identified  with NPAFP ‘were at more than twice the risk of dying than those with  wild polio infection.’ [8]<br />
  </div>
<p>The corruption and deceit by these organizations does not stop there.</p>
<p><b>The Gates Foundation Blamed for 10,000 Vaccine-Related Deaths</b></p>
<p>In 2013, yet another report named the Gates Foundation and GAVI as  being responsible for multiple deaths using untested vaccinations on  children from the developing world.</p>
<p>The report, published on the website Occupy Corporatism and written by Susanne Posel stated:</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>It was found out through an investigation, that GAVI was using an untested vaccine; giving this dangerous vaccine to Pakistani children shows the lack of empathy associated with these organizations. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>GAVI was blamed for the deaths of 10,000 children in Pakistan when they came in and administered polio vaccines that resulted in casualties. [9]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As we know, GAVI is heavily funded by the Gates Foundation. [10]</p>
<p>So, what was the name of the organization that investigated GAVI and found them using untested polio vaccinations in Pakistan?</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/vaccinetruth.html" rel="nofollow" style="float: right;margin-left: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-MkKSFqq5-DE/TfAbRwTtoXI/AAAAAAAAJRE/itK2KofpgVU/VACCINE-BANNER.gif" alt=""></a>According to the<i> Express Tribune</i> article, which I referred  to earlier in this article, it was none other than the Indian  government, who, upon discovering the shocking truth, recommended the  immediate suspension of the administration of all types of vaccines  funded by GAVI. [7]</p>
<p>In a recent radio show hosted by Sallie O. Elkordy, Susanne Posel  gave her frank and honest views on the whole sorry mess that we find  ourselves in today.</p>
<p>Warning: This report is not for the faint-hearted. [11]<br />
<b><br />
Conclusion</b></p>
<p>It is difficult to believe that, despite the mounting evidence  outlining the many crimes against humanity that have been committed by  the Gates Foundation, GAVI, UNICEF and PATH, Bill Gates is portrayed as a  hero among many.</p>
<p>However, according to the definition of hero in the Oxford Dictionary, the word hero means:</p>
<div style="padding-left: 30px">A person, typically a man, who is admired or idealized for courage, outstanding achievements, or noble qualities. [12]<br />
  </div>
<p>The dictionary I used said nothing about vaccinating innocent,  vulnerable children with untested and unsafe vaccinations, causing them  to suffer agonizing, untimely deaths.</p>

<p><i>Christina was born and educated in London, U.K. She left school to work in a children’s library, specializing in story telling and book buying. In 1978 Christina changed her career path to dedicate her time to caring for the elderly and was awarded the title of Care Giver of the Year for her work with the elderly in 1980. In1990 she adopted the first of two disabled boys, both with challenging behavior, complex disabilities and medical needs. In 1999 she was accused of Munchausen by Proxy after many failed attempts to get the boys’ complex needs met. Finally, she was cleared of all accusations after the independent psychologist Lisa Blakemore-Brown gave both boys the diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder and ADHD as part of what she described to be a complex tapestry of disorders. During the assessments Ms Blakemore-Brown discovered through the foster care diaries that the eldest boy had reacted adversely to the MMR vaccine. After taking an A Level in Psychology and a BTEC in Learning Disabilities Ms. England spent many years researching vaccines and adverse reactions. She went on to gain a Higher National Diploma in journalism and media and currently writes for the American Chronicle, the Weekly Blitz, VacTruth, where <a href="http://vactruth.com/2014/10/05/bill-gates-vaccine-crimes/">this article first appeared</a>, and Namaste Publishing UK on immunization safety and efficacy whilst continuing to study for a BA Honors degree in English Literature and Humanities. England’s main areas of expertise are researching false allegations of child abuse and adverse reactions to vaccines. Her work is read internationally and has been translated into many languages. Ms England has been a guest on many radio shows and has spoken at seminars worldwide. She is the co author to the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Syndrome-Vaccine-Induced-Encephalitis-ebook/dp/B004OEKDMS/ref=sr_1_fkmr1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1355752412&amp;sr=8-2-fkmr1&amp;keywords=%C2%91Shaken+Baby+Syndrome+or+Vaccine+Induced+Encephalitis+%C2%96+Are+Parents+Being+Falsely+Accused%3F%C2%92">‘<b>Shaken Baby Syndrome or Vaccine Induced Encephalitis – Are Parents Being Falsely Accused?’</b></a> with Dr Harold Buttram.</i></p>

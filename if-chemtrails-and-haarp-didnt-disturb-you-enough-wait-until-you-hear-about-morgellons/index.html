<p>Amir Alwani, <i>Contributing Writer</i><br /><a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2011/11/if-chemtrails-and-haarp-didnt-disturb.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>Activist Post</b></a></p>
<p>For those unaware what chemtrails are, I will do my best to give you  an accurate breakdown of how I found out about them and what I’ve  learned since.  I will also include some health remedies that I’ve come  across which may be of some use.</p>
<p>Around October of 2009 I heard that our government was <a href="http://www.infowars.com/g-edward-griffin-talks-about-new-chemtrail-film/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spraying us</a> with chemicals from airplanes.  I should have <i>immediately</i> investigated further, but I didn’t until many months later.</p>
<p>Why?  Many reasons, not least because I was consuming high levels of <a href="https://youtu.be/C7r-6_5ePRQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fluoride</a>  and my diet was basically, “eat what comes my way”.  As this began to  change I gained enough sanity to start to notice the chemtrails more and  investigate further.  I experienced so many synchronicities around this  time, typically indicative of change in one’s life.</p>
<p>Eventually, what I uncovered baffled and disgusted me.  I would like  to stress that I do not seek to alarm anyone with the information  presented here.  Morgellons is downright creepy and exhausting to even  think about.  I’m really not surprised why I just found out about  Morgellons now, despite having researched and filmed chemtrails for over  a year.  I only seek to encourage much needed-debate and research.  Many  of you will already be familiar with a lot of this, but if you bear with  me it eventually gets more interesting.  For the newbies, proceed with  caution.  This is just a brief overview but there are graphic videos  linked in this article. Some of you might not want to be eating when  you watch some of these.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><b>A Brief Note To The Skeptics</b></p>
<p>If you exhale in the winter you can see your breath because the  surrounding air is cold.  Planes are closer to space and it’s cold up  there, so you get these trails coming out of the engines of the planes.   However, in the past when the planes would leave contrails  (condensation trails), those trails would disappear quickly, within  minutes.  Now, as a result of government projects around the world many  planes are <a href="https://youtu.be/DTxvWLrUeE8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">leaving trails which linger, persist, expand</a> and turn into what people then tragically refer to as “clouds.”</p>
<div style="float: left;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-right: 1em">
</div>
<p>
Tests show gargantuan levels of aluminum, barium, strontium, among  other strange ingredients like red blood cells and fungus.  This is  altering our atmosphere day by day, taking away the sky’s deep blue  colour, replacing it with an ominous and poisonous, sometimes blindingly  fluorescent white haze.</p>
<p><a href="http://beforeitsnews.com/story/1364/801/Who_Is_Waging_The_War_On_Terra.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">You are being attacked</a>  in this “modern” age and that much is certain.  Whether you agree that  the chemtrails exist or represent this, it is obvious that you are being  attacked via your <a href="https://youtu.be/nZBRBPgTOt0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">water</a> and <a href="https://potentnews.wordpress.com/food/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">food</a>.   Personally, I don’t think adding air to the list seems far fetched at  this point. And that’s just for “physical” stuff.  I haven’t yet  reminded you about the bombardment on our minds and souls via school and  the soul-sucking mainstream media.</p>
<p>Skeptics would be wise to note that one of the reasons that it’s not <i>always</i> just condensation trailing behind the planes is that the <a href="https://youtu.be/q28dQaaLQGQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spraying often <i>turns off and on</i></a>.  It is very revealing that one can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hh5z4a_eGs0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">see the planes spray and then stop spraying and then spray again</a> (especially while the plane does not change speed or anything like that).  To me that’s about as obvious as the <a href="https://potentnews.wordpress.com/nine-eleven/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">demolition of the twin towers</a> and <a href="http://rememberbuilding7.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">building 7</a>, but I digress.</p>
<p>There are seemingly thousands of other valid points confirming the  fact that we’re being sprayed.  If I wrote this a year ago, I might have  included many more of those but the data is out there.  The internet  abounds with <a href="http://www.infowars.com/geoengineering-our-environment-under-attack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">analysis</a> on this subject.</p>

<p>There are many weather-modification programs ravaging this earth.  The spraying is <a href="http://aircrap.org/another-chemtrails-illusion-connecting-more-dots/33368/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">happening in at least all of the NATO countries</a>. Even the <a href="http://wearechange.in/joomla/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=97:un-admits-that-geo-engineering-and-chemtrails-are-actually-going-on&amp;catid=1:latest-news&amp;Itemid=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UN admits that geo-engineering projects are occurring</a>.  It’s getting coverage in mainstream media now.  An <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?&amp;v=kTI2Ynr9rxM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NBC-affiliated station called KMIR reported on it</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://beforeitsnews.com/story/1312/870/HAARP_Involved_In_Freak_Snow_On_Occupiers.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zen Gardner</a> succinctly writes, “If this is news to you, see the US Military paper <a href="http://www.bariumblues.com/weather_modification.htm">Owning the Weather by 2025</a>. Says it all. Like chemtrails, just the <a href="http://www.sovereignindependent.com/?p=9344">patents for all this technology</a> is a total giveaway.”</p>
<p>The denial is very close to being over.  This expensive project, in its <a href="https://youtu.be/0h3I_JCPCnk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">many various forms</a>, is happening.  The ominous programs are<i> supposedly to fight global warming</i> but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/PotentNewsUpdates#g/c/67F9C0B0A0F61A4C" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>global warming is a hoax</b></a> and the chemtrails are <i>making us sicker</i>.   Mystery shrouds this branch of knowledge and even for those who’ve  gotten their feet wet the invitation to investigate further is often  lost in a gigantic sea of information, wars, protests, chaos,  distractions, routine, and an endless bombardment of crisis after  crisis.</p>
<p><b>Propaganda</b></p>
<p>In a sad and <a href="https://thechive.com/2010/07/08/these-clouds-just-win-at-life-20-photos/" target="_blank" title="Look at the comments below all the pictures here." rel="noopener noreferrer">hauntingly effective</a> effort to curtail the truth, we are told that there are simply <i>new</i> types of clouds these days.  These new types of clouds just popped up <i>now?  </i>Just like <a href="https://youtu.be/ssn2kmNf0ME" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this fire tornado</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/YSubC55KI2c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this death ray</a>?  Give me a break.  This would be laughable if it wasn’t disturbing.</p>
<p>As for the meteorologists, they seem to either not care or are  ignorant.  Them not reporting on this is like a nutritionist or a  personal trainer recommending you eat at <a href="https://youtu.be/mYyDXH1amic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">McDonald’s</a>.  Meanwhile, television and cute little <a href="http://www.rense.com/general76/cars.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">computer-generated Disney films</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/cGEmeqM7sRM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">other</a> Disney propaganda <a href="https://youtu.be/E_y5DLvdvnw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gets children used to seeing the weather behave in strange ways</a>.  Images of chemtrails are being found in many <a href="https://youtu.be/HlA-Rnd2g3E" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">commercials, advertisements, and products</a>  just to pacify us.  Introduce it to us slowly enough and nobody will  notice.  Sure, some of it must not be intentional, as there’s so many  chemtrails it’s hard to take a sky shot without them sometimes, but many  of them <i>are</i> intentional.</p>

<b>Look Up</b></p>
<p>Many can’t even imagine an aerosol project so evil, so they try their  best to avoid thinking about it or discussing it with anybody.  For many  others who are a little less cowardly, all <i>they</i> need to wake up is to <i>look</i> up.  I don’t know if that’s something to be proud of, or if it’s a shame that people even have to be <i>told</i>  to look up — it’s probably both.  If you’re reading this, go look  outside right now.  There’s a good chance you’ll see a plane spraying  your sky.  I’m not even exaggerating.  I used to keep a tally of the  days they were spraying until I noticed it was almost every day (even at  night).  And if you don’t see something being sprayed, there’s a good  chance you’ll see lots of bizarre straight lines that we did not used to  see in the past.</p>
<p>I eventually took many <a href="https://potentnews.wordpress.com/photo-gallery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">photos</a>  and shot time-lapse videos of the flagrant bio-chemical attack and the  associated scalar electromagnetic waves (discussed in more detail  later):</p>
</p>
<p><b>Less Sunlight</b></p>
<p>Discovering the chemtrails proved to reveal a lot more than I  originally thought it would.  For one thing, it became clear that many  people did not care about sunlight.  For most people busy resisting the  idea that chemtrails even exist, they completely miss out on noticing the fact that our skies have less sunlight.  <a href="https://youtu.be/U1m_aK8KEvo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">You don’t need a study to tell you this</a>.</p>
<p>Whether or not you think the chemicals they’re spraying are bad for us,  it would really be something else to say that you have <i>no problem</i>  with losing your sunlight.  Sunlight allows our bodies to produce  Vitamin D, after all.  Vitamin D deficiency causes a lot of problems.  <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/003069.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Natural News</a>  reports that, “Your risk of developing serious diseases like diabetes  and cancer is reduced 50% – 80% through simple, sensible exposure to  natural sunlight 2-3 times each week.”</p>
<p>If you’re going to be talking about throwing microscopic bits of  aluminum into our sky to deflect sun rays you better make sure you know  the full health implications.<b> </b></p>

<p>When people finally admit to themselves that this <a href="https://youtu.be/A3bwd6nEkCQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spraying </a>is  actually happening there are those that then gravitate towards the  assertion that this is an effort to deal with “global warming” / “climate change,” and that may indeed be the case with respect to many  of these programs.</p>
<p>However, I repeat – <a href="http://www.globalwarminghoax.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">human-made global warming is a giant hoax</a>.  Look at the <a href="https://potentnews.wordpress.com/chemtrails-haarp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">geo-engineering section</a> of my website and you’ll see lots of data backing up my assertion.  <a href="http://climatedepot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Climate Depot</a> is also a good source of info on this.</p>
<p>I don’t buy the lies about CO2 being the devil.  Studies show <a href="http://www.minnesotansforglobalwarming.com/m4gw/2009/02/breaking-news-plants-love-greenhouse-gas.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">plants would love more CO2</a>.    I don’t want to be a guinea pig.  If people are already throwing  metals into the air to deal with this, then I’m already a guinea pig.   It’s quite simple.</p>
<p>This subject deserves as much investigation as possible, and even more  courage if one wants to stomach what is uncovered.  It’s useful to keep  in mind that just because <i>you</i> wouldn’t harm large masses of populations that doesn’t automatically mean <i>that somebody else</i>  wouldn’t harm large masses of populations.  I will expand on the health  impacts of these chemtrails later, but for now remember that you’re  better off knowing about these things.  Stick your head in the sand at  your own peril.</p>
<p>Here are just four videos that should get a lot of people thinking, with respect to the hoax (especially the first video):</p>
<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/9362000">Randall Carlson interview on Reality Sandwich: Climate Change, Part 1 of 4</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/sacredgeometryint">Sacred Geometry International</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com/">Vimeo</a>.</p>

</p>
<p>Why would governments want to <a href="https://youtu.be/b-uzNBtdYOo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lie</a>  to us?  There are many reasons, some of the most plausible of which  mostly revolve around a de-population agenda and satisfying a cult’s  thirst for ultimate control of the entire planet, its people, their  thoughts, the people’s genes, the planet’s weather, etc., by means of a  newly created world government employed by dark forces and obviously not  accountable to the people, the 99%.</p>
<p>Speculating on the reasons behind this assault, <a href="http://beforeitsnews.com/story/1364/801/Who_Is_Waging_The_War_On_Terra.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zen Gardner</a> writes:<i></i></p>

<p><i>To reduce the population? Alter our genetic make up? Produce a morphed human race only capable of </i><i></i><i></i><i>subservient tasks to please a master race immune or protected from these mutative influences on a deliberately morphed planet?</i> </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><i>I know, pretty freaky. But all actually plausible.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Definitely plausible.  I’ll come back to this explanation, but first  let’s take a look at some basics that illustrate the true colours of  these eco-fascists.</p>

<p>As the months went by I started to notice <a href="https://youtu.be/7d2bp7BNt0s" target="_blank" title="video" rel="noopener noreferrer">bubbles in the rain</a>.   There were bubbles in puddles that would form in the streets, in my  backyard, on the fence, etc. Where the rain would accumulate at the  bottom of the drainage pipe at my home, the bubbles would seem to get  10cm high sometimes.</p>

<div style="text-align: left">Admittedly, I don’t know if this is related  to the spraying but I wouldn’t be surprised.  If I had more money I  would have had this stuff tested.  In Ottawa, I had called a local  testing laboratory and they were very surprised to hear about this.  I  was more surprised that I was the first, it seemed, that brought this to  their attention.  I moved from Ottawa to Halifax and I witnessed the  same thing here.</div>

<p>Gwen Scott, who I refer to later on as well, mentions (<a href="https://youtu.be/ZoKkebpzu7Q" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in a 2005 documentary</a>)  that mortality from respiratory diseases went from being the 8th most  leading cause of death in the USA to being the 3rd in a span of 5 years.</p>
<p>What else do we know?  Aluminum is in the mix and has bad effects on your health.  It is <a href="http://www.rense.com/general37/alum.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">associated with Alzheimer’s disease</a>.  Is this why now some <a href="http://www.healthboards.com/boards/archive/index.php/t-202172.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">people as young as 26 years old</a> are getting Alzheimer’s disease?</p>

<p><a href="http://bariumblues.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Barium</a> is also a hallmark of this spraying, and tests mentioned in the documentary, <a href="http://naturalnews.tv/v.asp?v=E7F48BB67C52273656BBDAD68BA7E9DA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>“</i>What In The World Are They Spraying?”</a>, reveal very high levels of barium, strontium, and aluminum.</p>
<p>Fungus that is sprayed on us also eats the nutrients our body needs to regenerate our immune system.</p>
<p>Often when I would run out to take pictures I would get instant  diarrhea.  Sometimes, it would hit me like a wave as soon as I opened  the door to my backyard.  Nowadays I seem to have developed somewhat of  an immunity to it, but when I was first documenting this the diarrhea  would be so bad I would sometimes go to the washroom 6 times a day.</p>

<p>Another noteworthy symptom is that I find it harder to breathe these  days.  Others I know are having more difficulty breathing these days as  well.  I don’t think this is imagined for me and it’s probably  less likely to be an imagined effect for those who weren’t even aware the  spraying was going on.</p>
<p>Barium’s devastating <a href="http://bariumblues.com/barium_.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">effects</a>  happen to include breathing difficulties, increased blood pressure,  heart rhythm changes, stomach irritation, muscle weakness, alterations  in nerve reflexes, damage to your brain, liver, kidney and heart.</p>
<p>Around this time I would notice that I would often get too hot, take  my shirt off, and then I would be almost instantly too cold and would  put it back on again.  This happened repeatedly and it seemed as though  my body was often confused about whether or not it was too hot or cold.   As the winter set in this annoying symptom went away.  I had heard that  the chemtrails are sprayed less in the winter.  I don’t know if that’s  true, but as the winter ended, those strange hot/cold symptoms  re-appeared.</p>
<p>Many farmers are also noting the decline in their yields.  A farmer I  know said that last month was the first time she had ever had  greenbeans growing in her own garden in October in her entire life.  A  woman in landscaping even told me she was seeing certain plants  flowering in times of the year that they normally wouldn’t.  Something  is definitely throwing the balance of nature off.  The video below  features many farmers talking about their experiences with this.</p>
</p>
<p>I’ve taken some photos of trees in Halifax which I thought looked  weird.  I suspect they’re somehow affected by the aerosol operations  too.</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both;text-align: center"><a href="https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/img_6304.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em;margin-right: 1em"><img border="0" height="400" src="https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/img_6304.jpg" width="300"></a></div>
<p>
A few months after beginning to research this spraying, I experienced a <a href="http://ottawa.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20100623/OTT_earthquake2_100623/20100623/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5.0 magnitude earthquake</a>  in Ottawa which was <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/06/23/canada-earthquake-map-whe_n_622935.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">felt as far away as Boston</a>.  I suspected it had been man-made because only a few hours later there was a <a href="https://ca.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idCATRE65N4DW20100624" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tornado in southern Ontario</a>.  When this technology is used, a common side effect is that it causes  other weather anomalies in the area.  Strange coloured lights are also a  telltale sign of the earthquake-weapon, and there were, in fact,  strange lights like this seen in <a href="https://youtu.be/7QkWEZVZYBI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Toronto</a> three days before the quake.  The quake itself was also 3 days before the G20 meeting.  There was also a <a href="https://youtu.be/mzNoNw-n94U" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">loud high-pitched sound and strange lights</a>  in the sky in Victoria, B.C., Canada one day before the quake (and B.C.  is right next to Alaska which hosts a couple H.A.A.R.P. facilities  which can inflict earthquakes…more on that High Frequency Active  Auroral Research Program later).</p>
<div style="float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><a href="http://activistpost.net/survivalseedbank.html"><img alt="" class="noshadow" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_qLAIskTQXUc/TVxr_EnYeqI/AAAAAAAAGzo/SeV_Frv5FHg/seedbankonly.jpg" style="background: none"></a></div>
<p>I took this earthquake as my cue to talk to my neighbours more and subsequently found out that <i>they</i> were having digestive problems, the source of which had remained a mystery for them.  They had even been going to the doctor to get blood tests to try to figure it out.  They had no idea that the <a href="https://youtu.be/WabzHXBJTHg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chemtrails</a>  existed or might have contributed to their suffering.  They were very  intrigued at the notion that the chemtrails might have been responsible.</p>
<p>It’s not a coincidence that <a href="http://beforeitsnews.com/story/1256/807/Pilot_Speaks_Out_About_Chemtrails_And_HAARP.html?currentSplittedPage=4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">genetically modified seeds are made to resist the aluminum</a>  they’re spraying our skies with.  The social engineers seek to cut off  all alternatives.  They want us to buy all our food from them.  They  want to manage every aspect of our lives.</p>
<p>Accurately studying the harmful effects of these metals on us is made  more troublesome by the fact that they can have synergistic effects.   There are many things being sprayed and it’s hard to know how they all  mix.  Sometimes I see a plane spraying a trail immediately behind  another plane’s trail, almost like they’re <i>trying</i> to cook something up.<b> </b></p>
<p><b>Healing Tips</b></p>
<p>Now that’s a lot of doom and gloom, and there’s more to come, but  let’s pause for a moment to examine ways to heal yourself from the <a href="http://purplehaze.4mg.com/symptoms.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">toxic effects</a> of this <a href="http://purplehaze.4mg.com/health.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cocktail</a>.  Of course, do not take this advice if you are already on a pharmaceutical.  Consult your doctor first if you are.</p>
<p>Anyway, Gwen Scott, N.D., seems to have a lot of knowledge on this subject and is featured in a fantastic documentary, <i>Aerosol Crimes</i>, which I highly recommend.  If you want, fast forward to 0:56:24 and you will see her say what I’m paraphrasing afterwords:</p>
</p>
<p>Some of what she says:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Essential fatty acids</b> help to push aluminum out through your hair, believe it or not.  <b>Omega 3-6-9 oils</b>  are essential for brain function.  Fatty acids also lower blood  pressure.  Apparently, good sources of essential fatty acids are <b>flax seed oil</b>, <b>evening primrose oil</b>, and <b>krill oil</b>.</li>
<li>Fluoride <a href="http://www.actionpa.org/fluoride/aluminum.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">causes you to absorb more aluminum</a>  that you come into contact with and that aluminum can cross the  blood-brain barrier, causing Alzheimer’s and short-term memory loss as  mentioned earlier.  Studies show a <a href="http://www.cfsw.us/2011/11/08/cfsw-presidents-letter-to-dunedin-fl-commissioners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5-15 point reduction in IQ</a> associated with fluoridation.  That might be one of the <a href="https://youtu.be/zo6SnvmMP9k" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">many reasons to <b>stop drinking fluoride</b></a><b>.</b></li>
<li>When aluminum ions and magnesium ions combine they clot the blood.  A good blood thinner is <b>ginger root</b> (capsules) and <b>ginko biloba</b>, although do not take this if you are already taking a blood thinning medication/pharmaceutical.  </li>
<li>For heavy metal removal you can use <b>diatomaceous clay</b> (make sure it is <i>food grade</i>).  This all natural and binds itself to heavy metals to allow release through bowels.</li>
<li>Things that kill the fungus that is being sprayed on us: garlic, <b>chinese mushrooms</b> (particularly in extract form) <b>like reishi, shiitake, and maitake</b>.  <b>Caprylic acid</b> and <b>colloidal silver</b> are also effective.  Scott recommends colloidal silver nasal spray for sinus infections.</li>
<li>Barium is carcinogenic and knocks out all the potassium from your body, causing muscle weakness and heart palpitations (<b>potassium supplements</b> could be considered).</li>
<li>Gwen Scott wears <b>a mask</b> when she goes outside to block out the toxic soup we’re all walking in.  She finds it dramatically reduces her symptoms.</li>
</ul>
<p>I tried to confirm if barium was actually “carcinogenic”, as many  trolls at online message boards were quick to refute that, and I came  across <a href="http://www.chemtrails911.com/docs/bariumhealth.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>The Department of Health and Human Services, the  International Agency for Research on Cancer, and the Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA) have not classified barium as to its human  carcinogenicity.</i> </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Barium has not been classified because there are no studies in  people and the two available animal studies were inadequate to determine  whether or not barium causes cancer.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What I outlined here only scratches the surface.  Here is a <a href="http://www.bariumblues.com/chemtrail_illness_protocol.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">very informative article</a> that Gwen Scott wrote which expands on ways you can defend yourself from this crap.</p>

<p>Possibly related — recently, on October 9th I witnessed something  which I had been meaning to do more research on, but that I had not had a  chance to look into yet.  I had heard that they were related to the  chemtrails.  That was these “chemtrail web things”.  I didn’t have my  camera with me at the time, but what I saw was like a web, but much  thicker than a spider’s web.  It looked like glossy or shiny silly  string with some parts that were slightly blueish.  It looked almost  melted like in this screenshot on the right, which I took from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL008F307D74CB5D9F" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this person’s YouTube video</a>.</p>
<p>As in that video, what I witnessed was also on the tip of the tree  branch and also looked as though it could have been thrown on there.   The person also said that this stuff would kill the trees it came into  contact with and that insects would avoid it.</p>
<p>As I dug deeper I found something that shocked me.  Many people were suffering from something called <a href="http://morgellonsresearchgroup.com/2011/11/14/the-mrg-bug-gallery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Morgellons</a>.   Unfortunately, doctors would turn these people away, telling them they  weren’t suffering anything and that they were delusional, more or less,  and that this disease did not exist.</p>
<p>Really?  Tell that to <i>these</i> people:</p>

<p>Two years ago <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/027419_Morgellons_fiber_research.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Natural News</a> reported,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>The third theory is that Morgellons is an infection  of nanotechnology. Several independent studies on Morgellons fibers  taken from patients have shown that the fibers consist of both inorganic  and unidentifiable materials. One group of fibers was sent to a  forensic scientist at the Tulsa Police Crime Lab in Oklahoma for  analysis. After analyzing and cross-referencing the morgellons fiber  with the FBI`s national database, it was found that it did not match any  known fiber within the database. Other studies claim that fibers can  withstand temperatures of up to 1400 degrees Fahrenheit.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This “disease” is strange, to say the least.  This is where the <a href="http://beforeitsnews.com/story/516/032/Transhumanism:_The_New_Face_of_Eugenics.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">transhumanism</a> comes in.  The President of the Morgellons Research Group, Kandy Griffin <a href="http://morgellonsresearchgroup.com/2011/08/07/morgellons-is-not-a-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">writes</a>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Morgellons is not a disease. It is a process. It is a  form of forced/directed evolution of the human genome. It is the fetal  stage of transhumanism, and it is upon us.</i> </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><i>This stealth project is being carried out with the use of the  daily chemtrail operations, which are happening globally. There is no  escape. The chemtrail operations are terraforming the earth and  everything on it, including you.</i> </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Many have died. While the CDC and Kaiser Permanente drag their  heels with its so-called study, humans are perishing, suffering  “unbelievable” symptoms and are left alone with nowhere to turn.</i> </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Countless patients have been improperly diagnosed with “Delusions of Parasitosis.”</i><br /><i>Just before the “explosion” of Morgellons here in the United  States, the CDC sent letters out to physicians across the country  stating that they were seeing an increase of patients with DOP.  Coincidence? I think not. They were covering their tracks, so to speak.</i> </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Last I knew, delusions do not cause oozing skin lesions, flying  insects, worms, fungus, molds, plants, colored fibers and fiber bundles,  polka-dotted, multi-colored plaques or </i><i>crystals of different  shapes/colors. These are just a few of the symptoms associated with this  mutation process, based on one’s genetic pre-disposition.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Depending on their size, these things can hurt when they come out and can feel like a small razor blade being pulled out of you.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://youtu.be/pzW5Kb8u0Og" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">description</a> for the next YouTube video mentions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Is aerosol spraying only about experimenting with  weather? What do the self-replicating fibres found in Morgellons  patients signify? Why are engineered materials being found in airborne  environmental samples?</i> </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><i>All this suggests a planetary engineering program that is  affecting and targeting all living things. Synthetic biology is  science’s most exciting new frontier, combining genetics, robotics and  nano-technology with artificial intelligence, hybridizing natural forms  and engineering tissues beyond our wildest dreams. The technology  explosion is skyrocketing, and artificial intelligence will soon surpass  our own capabilities.</i> </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><i>How will our world be organized then? Will we turn ourselves over  to machines? Or will we have become technological hybrids ourselves?</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I implore you to watch this in-depth presentation that goes into Morgellons in great detail.  <b>If  you watch nothing else here, watch the video below titled “From  Chemtrails to Pseudo-Life: The Dark Agenda of Synthetic Biology”</b>. The woman presenting it, Sofia Smallstorm, is an expert on chemtrails, weather control and synthetic biology.</p>
<p>The video even shows “crystals with embedded hexagons” and “strands  that glitter”.  She calls attention to how some people have hair that  glows and skin that strangely shimmers.  As mentioned, there are also  strange coloured plaques coming out of peoples’ bodies.  Some of them  have fibers coming out of them.  She mentions that one of the hexagons  found once grew a fiber in 20 seconds while someone was looking at it  under a microscope.</p>
<p>Particularly creepy, we apparently are all infected with this, but  only some people show outward symptoms and are not able to fight it,  typically due to genetic predisposition and a variety of other factors  including the strength of one’s immune system.</p>
<p>Watch it this fascinating presentation:</p>
</p>
<p>Near the end of the presentation (at 0:53:20), Smallstorm says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>You have seen, today, the deposition and active  presence of artificial materials in the sky, environment, and in living  things.  Nano-technology has arrived at our personal doorstep without  our permission.  It isn’t that this will happen in 2045 – it’s already  here.</i> </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Human enhancement is being sold to us as leaping tall buildings  in a single bound and having better thought, faster, higher  intelligence, perfect health, but all of that is the sales pitch.</i> </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Enhancement may in fact be degradation  – our being devolved to someone else’s specifications.  While  nano-biotechnology promises, in headlines, to make our world better, it  may in fact be busy taking us over so it can tailor us to the plan for  the hive.</i> </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Already transhumanists are looking forward to the creation of the  ‘post-human’, an ‘improved’ human that will have no gender, will not  reproduce, will be a better performer in the workplace, will not be  distracted by love or lust, will be free of disease thanks to these  nano-bots keeping it healthy, but all this is part of the fantasy.</i> </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><i>In reality, thanks to stressers on our physiology, infertility is  soaring, our sexuality is diversifying and the nuclear family is  falling apart.  Biotech is an exploding frontier.  It is clever enough  and small enough to enter and change our very cells.</i> </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><i>New forms of DNA have been invented.  There’s GNA, as I told you  about, and PNA – a hybrid of protein and DNA – that will add to our  double helix a third strand.  When nano-biotech has a firm footing in  us, it will be easy to upgrade and downgrade anyone and anything in any  way.  Oliver Curry an evolutionist at the London School of Economics  predicted in 2007, ‘The human race will one day split into two separate  species – an attractive intelligent ruling elite and an underclass of  dimwitted, ugly, goblin-like creatures’…</i> </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Transhumans will presumably be involved in this process, the  process of transformation, the process of renovation – remaking us into  what someone considers “improved”.  We are transhumans now.  “Improved”  is only what fits certain specifications.</i> </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><i>For instance, a specimen that can work 18 hours a day, a specimen  that is sterile, that will never have the responsibility of caring for  others, a specimen that is even tempered, with a narrow, predictable  range of expression – all this is ‘enhanced’, ‘improved’.</i> </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Better performance is just that, the ability to produce a better  result.  It does not mean a specimen with greater skills.  It may mean a  specimen with narrower skills and the ability to repeat a task.</i> </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><i>So while the current ethical debate is about whether or not we  should upload computers into our brains and how human we will be when  that happens there is something happening on the nano-scale right now.   What it is, exactly, is unknown to us as attempts by lay-people to  communicate with scientists about Morgellons-type materials are going  nowhere.  There is a blackout on this subject.  Its victims are  dismissed as having a psychological problem that is called ‘delusional  parasitosis’.</i> </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><i>The presence of patented creations in our bodies gives rise to  intellectual property issues. </i> </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><i> We know what has been done to small  farmers into whose fields the winds have brought genetically engineered  strains.  They are sued by the powerful agricultural companies who own  the patents.  Will the day come when we are subjected to the  jurisdiction of corporations whose patented materials we are carrying in  our bodies?  It doesn’t matter how it got there.  The fault is your if  it is simply in your possession.</i> </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><i>This is a forced partnership between us and them.  This is how we  will be eternally owned by them.  This is how they can push our biology  from homo sapiens to homo evolutis without our having a say in it.  For  now, engineered technology in all living things is a secret, but one  day we may be charged with unlawful possession of something that has  become a part of us that we cannot get rid of.</i> </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><i>The nature of biology is to adapt.  As more unnatural elements  enter our bodies, if we cannot reject them, we will find ways to  accommodate them…</i> </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><i>We are living, walking laboratories for powerful science in a  society of increasing control.  We are being altered.  The future being  spoken of is happening now.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The next video shows more close-ups that <i>seem to show numbers and letters actually written on these specimens and strange hexagons.  </i>At 10m:44s into the film the filmmaker asks<i>, “</i>Was  this hexagon (a large multiplex array sensor) used in a clandestine  experiment on people who were unaware they were part of a clinical  antibiotics trial?”:</p>
</p>
<p><b>Electromagnetic Waves and HAARP</b></p>
<p>There is a man discussed in a <a href="http://newworldorderreport.com/News/tabid/266/ID/3588/Mystery-Disease-Linked-to-Vanished-Israeli-Scientist.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Voltaire Net article</a>  who may have been involved in the creation of Morgellons “or a rare,  mutated form of Morgellons disease”.  The article states that it is alleged that this Israeli scientist named Moshe has connections to the Mossad.</p>
<div style="text-align: justify">
</div>
<p>Interestingly enough, the article mentions that at one point he was  being chased by the, ”LA police department and SWAT team, assisted by  the FBI, Secret Service, CIA, U.S. Army and several unidentified federal  officials.”</p>
<div style="text-align: left">Moshe’s car was, “reportedly knocked out by an electromagnetic pulse”.</div>
<div style="text-align: left">
</div>
<div class="code-block code-block-1" style="margin: 0px">
<div align="center" class="mrf-external"><a href="https://trk.mdrtrck.com/aff_c?offer_id=6116&amp;aff_id=1106&amp;source=APContent"><img src="https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Avoiding-The-Eye-Banner.jpg"></a></p>

</div>
<p>What? Knocked out his car with an electromagnetic pulse?  Hopefully that didn’t cause the same kinds of problems that it <a href="http://www.sovereignindependent.com/?p=29550" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently did in Spain</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>…the local police force used some high tech device  from the police station that caused most all electronic items within 500  meters of the police station to be knocked out for about one hour. The  Police told the locals it was a safety wave. This safety wave effect lasted for about one hour in the early morning times while  the Helicopter flew in and about one hour later flew out. The effects  were no mobile phones in that 500 meter radius of the police station  would work. No cars within that field effect could be made to start  their engines. All other cars outside the region were not allowed to  enter this safety wave region so it’s not known if they</i> <i>can knock out engines that were running at the time of the safety wave event.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><i>All satellite TV and cable TV devices in the safety wave region  were knocked out also. We are talking a region festooned with multi  story apartment blocks with hundreds if not thousands of normal Spanish  going about their normal lives unaware that there was some sort of test  of a safety wave device about to be given to them.</i> </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><i>There seems to have been other unconfirmed issues suggesting pace  makers and other medical devices were effected both within the safety  wave region and possibly further than the safety wave field. There  seemed to have been a local spike in death rates that day and for  several days it was rumoured that the local funeral homes had a spike in  burials.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This would be a great time to start talking about the earthquake  weapon.  You see, not only would there be planes leaving these heavy  metals, salts, and strange fibers, etc., but i noticed that the clouds  and/or “clouds” would exhibit a strange sand-like wavy effect like in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU4pVxvUQGw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this video</a>.</p>

<p> I’ve since tried to document as much of this  type of thing as possible on video.  This next video features a bunch  of this shot in time-lapse mode but also included is one of the most  intense electrical storms I’ve ever seen.  There was no rainfall and  almost no thunder during this storm.  Perhaps there are more electrical  storms due to aluminum being able to conduct electricity:</p>
<div style="text-align: left">

<p>
(<a href="https://vimeo.com/28900803" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mirror 1</a>)(<a href="http://www.naturalnews.tv/v.asp?v=80568E9915DD94D5D19D8596688D2927" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mirror 2</a>)</p>
</p>
<p>I saw this strange halo formation in 2010:</p>
</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/LSfq1N8vcuc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Looking into this</a> I found out the phenomenon is called <i>scalar electromagnetic waves</i>.  My research into chemtrails naturally led me to discover <a href="https://youtu.be/dBh7qEQa_tA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HAARP</a>, a “research project” that the US military conducts  involving concentrating energy into a beam used to heat the  ionosphere.  Chemtrails can be used in conjunction with this as a way to  bounce energy off of the ionosphere, using it as a mirror of sorts.</p>
<p>Prior to that, Dr. Brooks Agnew was using this technology on a smaller  scale to search for oil and gas, a process called earth tomography.   This technology would even be able to tell you the quality of the oil  found.</p>
<p>I’ve since discovered that at present, many countries around the world have <a href="https://youtu.be/lG2mFfgaHyo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this technology</a>. Its applications include weather-modification, <a href="https://youtu.be/j6-5F4G4l6g" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mind-control</a>, causing earthquakes, detecting  oil or underground bunkers, over-the-horizon radar, projecting  holograms, beaming sound into your head, giving you diarrhea, targeting  specific organs, affecting your mood or giving you insomnia, etc.  All  this was impressive and chilling, to say the least.</p>
<p>There is information out there which strongly suggests that HAARP or  technologies like it are directly responsible for the malicious  infliction of an earthquake on <a href="https://youtu.be/zqDgfjdZUtw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Haiti</a>, China (<a href="https://youtu.be/KKMTSDzU1Z4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lights 30 min prior</a> to earthquake, <a href="https://youtu.be/hzVamNQzfYA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 min prior</a>), <a href="https://youtu.be/AV-W3CJAkuo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New Zealand</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/8NEHLEOEwYo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chile</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/PotentNewsUpdates#grid/user/94B3A2A277A539A8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Japan’s recent mega-disaster</a> as strange rainbow-ish tinges, almost like northern lights, are seen preceding those earthquakes and are generally <a href="https://youtu.be/BUla025DMY8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">associated with this negligent tampering</a>.  <a href="http://www.world-mysteries.com/doug_katrina.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hurricane Katrina</a> is also a good candidate.</p>
<p>Here’s a documentary on the subject, titled <i>Holes In Heaven</i>:</p>
</p>
<p><b>The Dark Side</b></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the <a href="https://youtu.be/aHfZBQyr2Fs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">military applications</a> of this technology seem wholeheartedly reckless or sinister or both.</p>
<p>The father of this technology, Nikola Tesla, warned that if you hit  the earth with enough energy at a certain point, it will split in two.   This shouldn’t be surprising, considering martial artists can kill by  applying pressure at specific points on the human body, and also  considering that the Earth is an organism.</p>
<p>We should be brave regarding the challenges that await us. Yes, a <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/033564_solar_flares_nuclear_power_plants.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">solar flare might cause 200 Fukushima-style meltdowns</a> if we are short-sighted and nothing is done to <a href="https://youtu.be/VJm6J635McM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">humor alternative and more sane ways</a> of harvesting nuclear energy – ways which might not kiss the weapon industry’s behind – and yes, Morgellons is frightening… <a href="https://soundcloud.com/naturalnews/stay-positive-hard-times" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">but at least we know</a> about this and other threats.  It’s better than <i>not</i> knowing and at least the <a href="https://youtu.be/LUrC81zmHMg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Internet is not dead <i>yet</i></a>.</p>
<p>Let’s get back to barium at this point.  This video below explains that barium also happens to be an ingredient used in <b>Project Bluebeam</b>,  which is a government program that intends to project holographic  images of deities descending down to major cities around the world, all  of this coinciding with audio being beamed into the heads of the  populations in a massive theatrical psy-op.  An alien invasion hoax  scenario has also been considered.  This sounds crazy but watch the  video below:</p>
</p>
<p>Recent sightings/footage of a <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2008161/Ghostly-mirage-appears-river-Huanshan-City-China.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“mirage”</a>  in China might indicate further experimentation in this field.  Yes,  you read that correctly – footage.  They actually took pictures and  video of this “mirage” and it looks like a picture-perfect city floating  on water, all highly detailed.</p>
<p><b>The Bright Side</b></p>
<p>Interestingly enough, I knew someone who monitored the weather and  solar flares intensely.  One time he told me and my girlfriend, “In  three days there’s going to be a massive solar flare so watch out for  your dreams to get vivid and crazy”, and sure enough, the dreams we both  had were intensely vivid.</p>
<p>If the arrangements of planets in our solar system affects our minds,  moods, and psychology, then why shouldn’t the arrangement of some other  “physical” stuff, like a star spitting at us, do the same? Some people  like <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2011/05/2012-and-electromagnetic-effects-on.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dieter Broers</a> even go so far as to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>I am convinced that we are currently in the midst of  a process involving the restructuring of our neuronal networks, and  that the catalyst of this process is the high solar-geomagnetic activity  whose consequences are feared by so many people today. However, all  facts and findings add up to the undeniable conclusion that this  evolution will for the first time in human history enable us human  beings to use the enormous potential of our brains.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He goes on to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>The events the cosmos has in store for us in 2012  can be compared to the effect of being handed a glass of juice into  which someone has slipped some LSD without our knowledge.</i> </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Such  unanticipated altered states of consciousness have certainly occurred at  other junctures in human history. For example, sudden outbreaks of  hysteria provoked by hallucinations occurred regularly during the Middle  Ages. Those affected were unaware that the bread they were eating  contained ergot, whose active ingredient Albert Hofmann used to make LSD  many years later. Inasmuch as the hallucinogenic effects of bread  containing ergot were unknown at the time, those affected could only  conclude that their altered mental state was a serious illness.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can only speculate as to whether or not the aerosol campaigns and  diminishing sunlight represent, at least in part, an effort to suppress  this incoming flood of consciousness expanding space-stuff.</p>
<p>Far from simply waiting for the sun to give us a nice trip and insights, Broers <a href="http://www.realitysandwich.com/node/97809" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">uses this understanding for good</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>…so-called hopeless patients have been successfully  treated using the effects of solar-geomagnetic fields on the mind,  perception and consciousness. This megawave therapy, as it is called,  consists in the administration of electromagnetic fields that are  identical to those found in nature. This therapy has achieved  exceptionally high cure rates by virtue of the fact that for the first  time the patients understand the cause of their disorder. Hence this  therapy is closely bound up with a catalyzed process of consciousness,  and does not at all involve a crude mechanistic procedure.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dieter Broers is definitely not oblivious to the harmful effects of  this technology when used in a bad way. Nor is Nick Begich – the expert  who has brought so many of the crucial points of caution to light –  going to resist mentioning that <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2011/11/angels-still-dont-play-this-haarp-full.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HAARP</a> could have the ability to cause chemical reactions in the atmosphere and thus <a href="http://www.theforbiddenknowledge.com/hardtruth/angels_dont_play_this_haarp.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">replenish ozone</a>, if indeed that is a problem up there:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>An application developed by Dr. Bernard Eastlund,  the inventor of the original HAARP technology, is the combination HAARP  technology with a fusion torch, which can be used for burning low-level  radioactive waste and neutralizing that waste while producing energy  from it. That’s an interesting environmental technology. He thought  about the HAARP technology being used for replenishing ozone in the  upper atmosphere and for decreasing pollutants by accessing the resident  frequencies that would generate and create chemical reactions in the  upper atmosphere. Getting rid of air pollution by using this kind of  system is an incredible application!</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, Daniel Pinchbeck’s book, <i>2012: The Return Of Quetzalcoatl</i>  (2006, p.103) touches upon an interesting perspective with respect to  all this.  Writing about Terrence McKenna, Pinchbeck notes,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>He  supported ‘the siren song of Pythagoras–that the  mind is more powerful than any imaginable particle accelerator, more  sensitive than any radio receiver or the largest optical telescope, more  complete in its grasp of information than any computer:  that the human  body–its organs, its voice, its power of locomotion, and its  imagination–is a more-than-sufficient means for the exploration of any  place, time, or energy level in the universe.’</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I must admit that I tend to agree with Terrence on this one.</p>

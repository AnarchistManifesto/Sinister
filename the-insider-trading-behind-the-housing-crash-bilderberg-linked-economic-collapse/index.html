<p>Congress investigated and found some… issues… but these (apparent)  criminals go free and remain in the shadows of public knowledge.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>With Johnson a Bilderberg steering committee member,  multiple-presidential campaign advisor and Goldman Sachs board member,  it is perhaps significant to note that at the 2006 Bilderberg Meeting in  Ottawa, Canada, <b>investigative journalist Daniel Estulin reported that sources were <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y99WD9ejfmk" target="_blank">telling  him that Bilderberg had essentially decided to pop the housing bubble  and that concerns over the housing crisis would be used to further bring  the economy down</a></b> This was two years before the housing  collapse would trigger the worst economic crisis in the United States  since the Great Depression – no one could have just made this stuff up.  There is the clear indication here of insider trading and racketeering –  a real investigation needs to take place to point fingers and arrest  the banksters committing racketeering.</p>

<p>Mozilo’s compensation during the United States housing  bubble of 2001–06 later came under scrutiny. During that period, his  total compensation (including salary, bonuses, options and restricted  stock) approached $470 million. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Mozilo testified before the United States House Committee on  Oversight and Government Reform on March 7, 2008, calling reports of  their pay “grossly exaggerated” in some instances and pointing out that  they lost millions as well. He defended the pay: The compensation was a  function of how the company did ahead of the mortgage crisis.</p>

<b><br />
IX. Countrywide and Fannie Mae Were Closely Aligned</b></p>
<p>From the <b>U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Government Reform</b> (Darrell Issa, Chairman) report from July 5, 2012, titled <b><a href="http://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Countrywide-112th-Report-7.3.12-1207-PM.pdf" target="_blank">“How Countrywide Used its VIP Loan Program To Influence Washington Policymakers.”</a></b></p>
<p>In 1999, Fannie Mae CEO Jim Johnson and Countrywide CEO Angelo Mozilo  reached a strategic agreement giving Fannie Mae exclusive access to  many of the loans originated by Countrywide in exchange for a discount  on fees Fannie charged when buying loans. The agreement linked the  growth and success of Countrywide to Fannie Mae’s continued desire to  acquire a large volume of loans. Fannie Mae designed the deal to lock  competitor Freddie Mac out of the market for Countrywide’s loans. 218  The agreement amounted to a volume discount. According to Paul Muolo and  Matthew Padilla, co – authors of Chain of Blame , the arrangement  linked Fannie Mae and Countrywide “at the hip.”</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/backyardliberty.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ONE8Lk_RzR8/UjeZnRyZRTI/AAAAAAAAVJw/TMNS4NzHKZo/s220/BL_158220.gif" alt=""></a>E – mail from Maritza Cruz to Kay Gerfen (Sep. 19, 2002) (CW – COGR2 –  0007149). Instead of assessing the standard fee a 75 of 23 basis points  (0.23 percent) for every loan it guaranteed, Fannie Mae charged  Countrywide only 13 basis points, “the lowest ‘g – fee’ deal Fannie had  ever granted.” 220 While negotiating the volume discount, Countrywide  CEO Angelo Mozilo leveraged his company’s position as the nation’s  largest residential housing lender to extract concessions from Fannie  Mae CEO Jim Johnson, who himself received more than $10 million worth of  Countrywide VIP loans. 221 Fannie Mae General Counsel Alfred Pollard  stated that he is “not aware of a general industry practice of other  purchasers of mortgages entering into similar agreements during this  timeframe . . . .”</p>
<p><b>FINDING</b>: A strategic alliance forged in 1999 between  Countrywide and Fannie Mae linked the growth of the two companies. The  agreement was unique – there was not a general industry practice of  giving a volume discount to a mortgage originator. In 2005, the two  companies agreed to work together to expand lending to low – income  borrowers. Countrywide and Fannie Mae further expanded their  relationship with another strategic alliance agreement in 2005. During  each quarter, Countrywide was required to sell to Fannie Mae at least 70  percent of all “Expanded Criteria Mortgages,” and at least 65 percent  of those mortgages each month. Fannie Mae also agreed to “provide  special marketing and other assistance” to Countrywide in its efforts to  reach low – income borrowers. 224 Both parties pledged to continue a  “Favored Relationship” in which they were “committed to the business  success of the other party.” 225 The 2005 agreement required both  companies to “maintain the complete confidentiality of the existence and  terms of this agreement.”</p>
<p>In September 2005, Fannie Mae lobbyist Sharon Canavan wrote an e –  mail to Countrywide lobbyist Pete Mills. Canavan, whose own loans were  processed by Countrywide’s VIP unit, stated: “We just signed a new  alliance deal with you guys. Pleasure doing business with you Mills  replied: “Good. I like you guys!!!” 228 Fannie Mae Employees Gave  Countrywide Inside Information Throughout 2005, Fannie Mae and  Countrywide continued to expand their alliance. In April 2005, Fannie  offered Countrywide “improved pricing for investor loan products,” the  goal of which was “to offer an execution that is more competitive with  private label execution.” 229 Days later, on April 19, 2005, a Fannie  Mae official provided Countrywide executives with “a valuable heads up”  on a change in loan collection policy.</p>
<p>David Battany, former Director of Single – Family Business in Fannie  Mae’s Western Region office located in Pasadena, California, emphasized  the sensitive nature of the information. In an e – mail to Countrywide  Chief Risk Officer John McMurray, Battany stated: The above policy is  not public, and you should be the first in the country to know this  information. Please do not share this information outside of Countrywide  at this time.</p>
<p>Fannie Mae Senior Executives Received the Highest Level of VIP  Service Documents and information obtained by the Committee show the  extent of Countrywide’s efforts to align the company with the most  senior leadership at the GSEs. Documents show that Mozilo was personally  involved in helping obtain discounted loans for former Fannie Mae  executives James Johnson, Franklin Raines, Jamie Gorelick and Daniel  Mudd. The documents also show Mozilo’s close personal relationship with  Johnson, with whom he negotiated the first strategic partnership  agreement that formally linked Countrywide and Fannie Mae for the first  time. Jimmie Williams was familiar with Johnson and Raines. He received  referrals from Fannie Mae and passed them to the VIP unit. He stated: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q And did you regularly get referrals from Fannie Mae, or was this sort of a unique experience? </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A I remember getting a couple from Fannie Mae. Q And when you got referrals from Fannie Mae, what did you do with them? </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A The same process. It was the same thing, same process, same number,  same desk. 232 Countrywide processed loans for Fannie Mae employees who  participated in an employee assistance program, which provided money  that could be put toward a down payment. Cruz testified that the VIP  team was familiar with these complicated loans and processed them  frequently. She stated: </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: Do you recall that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac employees were frequently referred into the program? </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A: Yes. Actually, more Fannie Mae than Freddie Mac, but anybody that  wanted to access our unit would get an application in and we would  process it. In fact, we were aware of the employee assistance program  for Fannie Mae, which requires a little bit of process that some people  didn’t want to get involved when you have to take care of that. So we  did, being that they knew among their employees, they knew how we were  able to take care of those things, then they would refer themselves to  us to take care of those loans. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: So Fannie Mae employees who took advantage of their internal employee assistance program </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A: Yes. </p>

<p>Q: — would be made aware of Countrywide’s A: Yes, that we were able  to process that part of their transaction. Because it entailed to fill  out some forms, get signatures, send it to another underwriter in Fannie  Mae that would sign off and say , okay, the loan is okay for this part  of the assistance. Because what it was, part of the down payment came  from funds from Fannie Mae for them to purchase the property.<b><br />
</b></p>
<p><b>Jim Johnson James “Jim” Johnson</b> became chairman and CEO of  Fannie Mae in 1991. David Maxwell, former general counsel for the  Department of Housing and Urban Development , had initially recruited  him to join Fannie Mae.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/backyardliberty.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 0em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-k0NQ-rOJPq0/UPDSF5crnFI/AAAAAAAATcw/i7Q6pBk-hoQ/s200/BL_013-200.gif"></a>Williams Tr. at 115 – 116. Shortly after assuming the top position at  Fannie Mae , Johnson went on tour to meet with top executives at the  233 Rose Tr. at 162 – 165. Muolo and Padilla at 111. mortgage banking  firms with which Fannie had business. In California, Johnson met Angelo  Mozilo, whose company Countrywide was already selling conforming loans  to Fannie Mae. 236 Fannie’s handled its business with Countrywide from  Fannie Mae’s west coast office, “conveniently located right across the  street from Countrywide’s headquarters.”</p>
<p>Johnson and Fannie Mae accountants in charge of tracking the sources  of the loans purchased by the GSE noticed Countrywide’s rapid growth.  238 Realizing Fannie Mae would be buying the majority of its loans in  the future from non – bank mortgage companies like Countrywide, Johnson  made an effort to court Mozilo. At the time, Countrywide was originating  billions in loans and was on its way to becoming “the largest  residential lender in the United States.”</p>
<p>“When Jim realized how much volume Countrywide was taking down,  especially in California, he made it his mission to get to know Angelo,”  said a Johnson aide. As the business ties between Countrywide and  Fannie Mae grew stronger, so too did the personal ties between the two  CEOs. When Mozilo ordered discounts and other forms of preferential  treatment for Johnson and his friends and family, he frequently reminded  staff how important Johnson was to the company. After waiving one and a  half points on a loan for Johnson, Mozilo reminded David Kovnesky: “Jim  Johnson continues to be a source of many loans for our Company and this  is just a small token of my appreciation for the business that he sends  to us and for his loyalty to the Company.” He did. Johnson and Mozilo  became closely aligned. 242 When Mozilo was helping Johnson arrange a  loan for his son, he e – mailed Carlos Garcia: “I agreed to make a loan  to Jim Johnson’s [son’s] trust . . . . [I]f Jim need s to cosign, he  will. It is important that we make this loan because of Jim’s help to  the Company over many years. Please call Jim directly . . . and let me  know if you need anything else.” 243 In an e – mail to Andrew Gissinger,  Mozilo stated: “Jim is a very important customer.”</p>
<p>Johnson was described as a “big time FOA” in another internal e-mail.  Mozilo’s message got through. When Underwriter Gene Soda was  uncomfortable approving a loan to Johnson because of credit issues, he  knew to seek further instructions rather than deny Johnson’s loan application. In the past these loans  were just approved as directed. However, based on [the credit report]  I’m concerned about signing on these loan s. These are obviously very  high profile borrowers and lack of performance will be reported. I need  some direction on how to proceed. In an e-mail to Managing Director  David Spector, Soda wrote:</p>
<p>Mozilo ordered the loan approved, and gave Johnson a break. He  instructed the VIP unit: “Charge him ½ under prime. Don’t worry about  [the credit score]. He is constantly on the road and therefore pays his  bills on an irregular basis but he ultimately pays them.”</p>
<p>When Condé Nast Portfolio and The Wall Street Journal broke the story  of the VIP program in June 2008, Johnson’s legal team requested help  from Countrywide in developing a public relations strategy. In an e-mail  to Countrywide’s Chief Legal Officer, Johnson’s lawyer wrote: On behalf  of Jim Johnson, I wanted to solicit Countrywide’s willingness to put  out a brief statement simply noting that this was part of a regular  business program at Countrywide that served hundreds of senior corporate  executives and high – net worth clients (much as any private banking  unit would at any lender), and was not specific to Johnson’s Fannie Mae  connection.”</p>
<p>Mozilo obliged. He notified Countrywide’s public relations staff that  Johnson was enrolled in the VIP program because he referred a lot of  business to Countrywide. Mozilo wrote: Jim received no ‘special’  treatment . He has been the source of much business to Countrywide  because of his confidence in us and knowing that we would treat anyone  who comes to us fairly.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/familysurvivalsystem.html" rel="nofollow" style="float: right;margin-left: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-2dxSSyJSY-M/UnqDDNjqNaI/AAAAAAAAV7s/GmrEINt_kNM/s220/imgad.jpg" alt=""></a>In fact, Countrywide gave Johnson special treatment to a greater  extent than it did for any other VIP borrower. Mozilo made sure  Countrywide went to great lengths to reward Johnson for his personal and  professional relationship with the company. Johnson received the full  suite of benefits from Countrywide’s VIP unit – from keeping Johnson’s  purchase of a condominium in the Ritz Carlton secret from his wife so he  could surprise her, to giving discounted loans to his son 252 and his  maid, E – mail from Maritza Cruz to Gene Soda, Apr, 27, 2005 (CW – COGR –  0073839). to ignoring 80 credit issues and debt ratios 255  Additionally, Johnson was able to refer borrowers to the VIP unit.</p>
<p>Johnson referred John Potter, Kent Conrad, and Donna Shalala to  Countrywide, among others. when Johnson’s loans did not comply with  lending standards. To assist Johnson’s lawyers, Countrywide quickly  gathered data about the various loans Johnson received from Countrywide.  The company’s own audit showed that Johnson received loans at below –  market rates.</p>
<p>In an interview on National Public Radio’s Fresh Air, Morgenson  described Johnson as “corporate America’s founding father of regulation  manipulation.” Morgenson stated: This is a person who really, really  wrote the blueprint for how to neutralize your regulator, how to  manipulate Congress to get your way and, you know, essentially how to  destroy your critics. And they just took no prisoners over those years.  They were extremely hard – nosed, extremely aggressive and abrasive, and  really understood how to make sure that they had friends in Congress at  all times. Now, their regulator at that time was very weak. It was HUD,  the Housing and Urban Development, and essentially what Johnson did,  which was really amazing at the time, was to help write legislation in  1991 and ’92 which became the Safety and Soundness Ac t that was  designed to prevent Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac from calling on taxpayers  in a time of failure. Also according to Morgenson, Johnson changed  Fannie’s executive compensation plan to reward volume rather than  quality of loans. Johnson earned over $200 million while working at  Fannie Mae.<b> </b></p>

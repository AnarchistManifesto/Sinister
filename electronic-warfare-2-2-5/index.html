<p>It is within the nature of mankind for a disproportionately small percentage of men to attempt to exert control over the greater multitudinous horde. The primary method of control is achieved through violent oppression. Violence is required as most people will not willingly submit to control by others, be it few or many. For violence to be perpetrated, weapons are required. Our history as a species can be defined, in large measure, by the vehicles of violence (weapons) employed at the point in history being addressed.</p>
<div>When rocks were all that was to be had in way of potential weapons, we secured them to the end of stout sticks and bashed each other’s skulls in. When metal forming technology manifested in our species, we beat the metal thin, sharpened the edge, and proceeded to hack and whack the limbs and heads from our enemies. Of course when gunpowder and guns were created, a prodigious wave of violence was unleashed that remains unabated to this very minute. Even as you read this piece, a person is killed by armed conflict every one hundred seconds, so read fast! Lives depend on it man! [<a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-204_162-524231.html">1</a>].</div>
<p>Firearms and their steroidal offspring; bombs, canons, missiles, bazookas and such sufficed for centuries as a perfectly efficient way of meting death. These deaths were unavoidable as there existed no recourse to armed conflict and brute force resolution. If control is the goal, then guns were the way to see that happen. It’s been this way for quite a few hundreds of years.</p>
<p>There are heads of state throughout history that seem to have no other goal than to kill their fellow human beings. These psychopathic individuals are well known. What makes them tick is another subject altogether, and is addressed in great detail by Andrew M. Lobaczewski’s definitive treatise on the subject, <i>Political Ponerology- a Science on the Nature of Evil Adjusted for Political Purposes</i> [<a href="http://www.ponerology.com/">2</a>].</p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>However, not all despots energetically seek to kill their country’s citizens, but do so rather as a consequence of objection to their designs. For the most part, though, nefarious rulers, dictators, khans, kings, emperors, sultans, presidents and a host of other titled leaders primarily seek to control a country, region or continent – both the people in it and the resources in, on and under the land. In most cases the primary objective of a tyrannical government is to exercise <i>absolute </i>control over the conquered and/or subjugated populace, with the most telling benefit being the subsequent revenue stream generated by lopsided trade agreements and myriad forms of taxes imposed on businesses and individuals. Investigate the Federal Reserve, the populace debt collateral and income taxes. [<a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2012/05/mechanics-of-fractional-reserve-banking.html">3</a>] It takes a true psychopath to want to kill the golden goose…us! Corpses don’t pay taxes, after all.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, if humanity is a carriage, then the man driving with the whip is content to lighten the carriage’s load to the tune of a 93% reduction, from seven billion people to five hundred million. The ‘man with the whip’ is an allegorical agglomeration of the * 1/1000th of the 1%; the real wealth here on earth. (That’s still a lot of people. There are seven <i>billion </i>people on earth. Do the math. Just kidding . . . that’s <i>still </i>seven thousand people.) The next time you flip to TNT (Turner Network Television) remember Ted Turner’s words [<a href="http://www.seebelow.com/">3.5</a>], “A total population of 250-300 million people, a 95% decline from present levels, would be ideal.” One might have a hunch all those near and dear to him won’t be in his wished-upon reduction group – but we are. Ted Turner wants us dead . . . how charming. Terrifyingly, he is not alone in his assessment. This conviction is shared by other immensely powerful people in that rarefied percentile. [<a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/from-7-billion-people-to-500-million-people-the-sick-population-control-agenda-of-the-global-elite">4</a>]Before the advent of harnessed electricity, invasion and conquering was accomplished through brute force, accompanied by the old fashioned brick and mortar weapons of war we’ve come to know and loathe. This method of war is going the way of the Dodo. Human ingenuity and the diligent efforts of mad scientists (can you call people who spend their days devising ever more efficient ways to kill their fellow men anything but mad?) have produced an entirely new class of weapons to unleash on peaceful, protesting people everywhere. Enter electronic warfare.</p>
<p>There are electromagnetic weapons currently being deployed against various citizens of the world. We know them as microwave cannons, or directed energy beams. They’ve been around for decades. At Greenham Common in England, a 30,000 strong group of women camping outside an army base in protest to the deployment of nuclear-tipped US cruise missiles learned first-hand about these electromagnetic weapons. [<a href="http://rense.com/general62/mciro.htm">5</a>]</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>One day in the summer of 1984, more than 2,000 British troops suddenly pulled back, leaving the fence unguarded. Peace mom Kim Besley recalls that as curious women approached the gate, they started experiencing odd health effects: swollen tongues, changed heartbeats, immobility, feelings of terror, and pains in the upper body. Besley found her 30-year-old daughter too ill to stand. Other symptoms typical of electromagnetic exposure included skin burns, severe headaches, drowsiness, post-menopausal menstrual bleeding and menstruation at abnormal times.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em" href="http://activistpost.net/infinite-brain.html" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_qLAIskTQXUc/TdSeGgTQjyI/AAAAAAAAI3g/uIBlfFK1IqU/Todd-250x250-01A.gif" alt=""></a>Even earlier, in 1962 Moscow, US embassy staff experienced similar symptoms as the result of directed weak pulse microwaves emanating from Soviet intelligence agencies, whilst being monitored by interested CIA operatives. This is reported to have been part of Project Phoenix, an operation within the larger US government program SETI (Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence) [<a href="http://rense.com/general62/mciro.htm">5</a>], [<a href="http://www.seti.org/seti-institute/project/details/project-phoenix">6</a>]. The electronic warfare (EW) arsenal is not limited to microwave and directed energy beams. On our own soil, used by our own government against peaceful protesters, sound cannons were deployed to disperse crowds at the Occupy Wall Street movement in November, 2011. [<a href="http://idealab.talkingpointsmemo.com/2011/11/lrad-explains-sound-cannon-use-at-occupy-wall-street.php">7</a>] The manufacturer [<a href="http://www.lradx.com/site/content/view/33/47/">8</a>] insists it is a communication device. They claim the “Long Range Acoustic Device (LRAD) provides military personnel with a powerful, penetrating warning tone that can be followed by clear voice broadcasts in host nation languages to warn and <i>shape </i>the behavior of potential threats.” (Emphasis added)</p>
<p>The specs indicate the LRAD employs directed sound technology to move the security engagement envelope from 50 meters (164 feet), without LRAD, to in excess of 3000 meters (1.86 <i>miles</i>), with LRAD, by emitting a directed, focused 110db sound that causes nausea, headaches, and yes, hearing loss. It has been compared to listening to a power saw at close range. Its ability to disperse a crowd has been proven publicly, courtesy of the crowd at Occupy Wall Street, itself an elite sponsored controlled opposition initiative. The globalists will go to any lengths to keep the public’s wrath focused on anyone or anything but the central banking apparatus; the wellspring of their power, the means by which they enslave nations and place unborn generations in debt. In this instance, they threw the Wall Street banksters under the bus. Those useless, money grubbing, soul selling Wall Street louts are fodder for the globalist’s furnace, and they don’t even know it. Sad. One can only hope they awaken. Indeed, they will when the party grinds to a halt and UN blue helmets are stationed at the corner of Wall Street and Nassau.</p>
<p>These examples serve to illustrate there are a wide range of electronic weapons at the disposal of those that would do us harm, and these mentioned are only the ones we know about. It’s been well established that military science is decades ahead of industrial science. This holds true in weaponry as well as the medical, energy and physics fields. Further, the above examples highlight the fact that a weapon does not necessarily have to kill to be effective.One thing to be sure of – if there is a way to improve something, someone will be busy trying to do just that. Electronic Weapons are of course constantly being tested and improved upon. Given the vast array of data and potential applications residing in such an enormous field of science, the function of the device itself can be altered to a desired effect. The electronic weaponry referenced above is a miner’s pickaxe to the jeweler’s ball peen found in mood modifying frequency weapons in evidence today. In the good old days of maces and archers, an enemy’s back could be broken, but there was no way to break the mind. If the <i>mind itself </i>could be conditioned to accept subjugation and defeat, then half the battle is done ‘ere the first arrow’s fletched. We have arrived at that very point in our weaponry evolution.</p>
<p>While not quoting Sun Tzu directly, a safe distillation of his philosophy as regards war would be that the greatest victory is that in which no fighting takes place – the globalists do study the masters. This is their goal; to get us, the useless eaters (as they have termed us), to accede to their domination with nary a peep. How do they accomplish such a feat? The answer to that can be found in Orwell’s <i>1984</i>. O’Brien wanted Winston Smith to believe that 2 + 2 = 5. It was not enough for Winston to say it – he had to <i>believe </i>it. And so the globalists want the same out of us. They want us to believe that psychotropic pharmaceuticals are the key to happiness and chemtrails are going to save us from global warming, that GMO corn is the answer to world poverty. Would we fight against that which we believe to be good and true?<a style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em" href="http://activistpost.net/unexplainablefrequencies.html" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-IxbGiBSsnzg/UDUKGoSAGMI/AAAAAAAARfM/QsLujOF3pGM/s200/aa200block.gif" alt=""></a>Let’s call this “EW-Second Generation”. This new generation is a hellish union of neuroscience and electronic weaponry, spawning a new method of mind control O’Brien would be impressed with – psychotronic weapons. In the Iraq war, US forces deployed innocuous sounding ‘Poppers’ throughout Baghdad. These two-foot high domes placed strategically in and around Baghdad emitted invisible, damaging electromagnetic frequency beams across the entire electromagnetic spectrum [9]; the end goal and effective result being to selectively alter moods, behavior and bodily processes [<a href="http://rense.com/general62/mciro.htm">5</a>]. They were very effective on Iraqi citizens, but given the indiscriminate nature of the weapon itself, the poppers also affected US forces. Suicides, desertions and episodes of homicidal rage manifested on both sides of the conflict. That military program is a boondoggle in its own right, but at the end of the day, it’s just another disastrous, fatal program gone wrong in the US government. Other than the personal tragedy of lost lives, this is barely newsworthy, and sadly, more the norm than not.</p>
<p>The physical science behind psychotronic weapons (think Matt Damon’s Will Hunting scribbling insanely complex equations on an oversized blackboard) is far beyond the average intellect, this one included. Therefore, a need exists to simplify. Any high school biology student knows that the human body is a self-contained electrical unit. The movie <i>The Matrix</i>, for all its fantastical imaginations, illustrated clearly and accurately that we run on electrical impulses. Where there is electricity, there is an electromagnetic frequency being generated. What photosynthesis is to plant leaves, so is frequency generation to electricity – one cannot exist without the other. Our brain is a self-contained multi-frequency processor, and like most things on this planet, can be altered by design.

<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>The brain is a computer, and like a computer it has a clock frequency that all thoughts, your existence, are centered around. This is a little basic because your brain in reality has multiple simultaneous clock frequencies which interact with each other and serve different purposes for biological function, whereas a microprocessor normally has only one central clock that everything in it synchronizes with. For example, your visual cortex may process at a different frequency than the section of your brain which regulates your heart beat. Feelings and thoughts will run at another frequency. Because your brain is an ultra-parallel computer, it can accomplish a lot while using frequencies that are far lower than would be practical in a microprocessor and these frequencies are in the ELF (extended low frequency) range. The fact that your brain operates on frequencies leaves it susceptible to manipulation via electronic means. Since different moods are reflected by different frequencies, it is possible to electronically force people to be relaxed when they should be angry, laugh when they should be appalled, and give loyalty when they should rebel.</p>

<p>There is no longer a need, as in <i>The Manchurian Candidate</i>, to strap a subject into a chair and bombard the recipient with images and disorienting drugs until their minds are a base soup waiting on spice. The EW weapons unleashed upon us on a daily basis are far more subtle. The mind, it is well known, operates on a conscious and subconscious level. The conscious mind sees and hears at one level; it operates on its own frequency. The subconscious mind operates at a different frequency, therefore ‘seeing’ images that our conscious mind doesn’t. This is not lost upon the globalists. One constant with them is that if an opportunity presents itself enabling them to exploit and control people, they will do all in their considerable power to turn whatever it is into a device or operation for just that purpose.</p>
<p>Endeavors in EW began decades ago. Sometimes the globalists reveal more than they should. (But then warning us of what is to come is their M.O. It’s key in their ability to carry the burden of their sins. Those globalists do the darndest things!). In the early ’70s, globalist brainiac strategist,  Zbigniew Brzezinski, summed up their intentions quite candidly[<a href="http://www.jimstonefreelance.com/cells.html">10</a>],</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>In the technotronic society the trend would seem to be towards the aggregation of the individual support of millions of uncoordinated citizens, easily within the reach [Insert-read ‘television’] of magnetic and attractive personalities effectively exploiting the latest communications techniques to manipulate emotions and control reason.</p>

In the beginning, messages were inserted at 1/25th of a second. The machine capable of this was called a tachistoscope. These (suggestive mind control) subliminal insertion frames were discovered and made public. A flurry of front page headlines and congressional laws were passed and the matter went bye-bye. Regards the discoverer of the shenanigans,[<a href="http://www.jimstonefreelance.com/vialls2.html">11</a>]</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>For a large consideration and a new Mercedes convertible, the aggrieved scientist who discovered the technique by accident, agreed to a cover story that the tachistoscope was only used for one experimental film run, involving subliminal prompts to buy Coke and popcorn, but was not terrible successful. The Mercedes convertible [gifted to him for his complicity] was involved in a high speed accident and fireball just two months later. There were no survivors.</p>

<p>Covert development proceeded along two parallel but independent tracks, with the first focusing on blending ‘low light images’ into an existing film or commercial. This was fast, and it was also a master stroke in its own right. The ‘low light’ system was ready for trials in less than six months, and the effects were startling. Essentially, while the conscious mind was viewing and inwardly digesting the main film or commercial content, the subconscious mind was picking up the low light subliminal messages, which fell just below the threshold of normal vision. Where the older tachistoscope was jerky and only partly efficient, the new ‘low light’ system proved to be a control revolution. The low light images were a complete ‘film within a film’ running at normal speed, and thus able to “properly educate” those citizens not entirely in accord with One World Government views. The critical test was whether or not the ‘low light’ technique could be uncovered if a copy of the film fell into the wrong hands. Exhaustive trials proved that it could not. Despite the most sophisticated ultraviolet analysis known to man, the embedded low light images could not be detected at all, because they were comprised of exactly the same color spectrum as the film itself. So, low light was dramatically effective, relatively cheap to engineer, and easy to transport and use without fear of security breaches…. This low light system is still in use today, and is still dramatically effective.</p>
<p>If we can be led to believe that 2 + 2 = 5, without our quite being aware of it, then the majority masses will indeed, for example, raise little fuss over the poisonous chemtrails hosing our atmosphere 24/7. (Doh! It happens now and where is the real outcry? YouTube? Right . . . Something’s worrrkiiinnng!). So, knowing this is happening and that we have no control over avoiding it, only one option presents itself, and is best conveyed by John Denver, [<a href="http://johndenver.com/albums/aerie/">12</a>] “Blow up your TV, throw away your paper, go to the country, build you a home. Plant a little garden, eat a lot of peaches, try and find Jesus on your own.”</p>

<p>* Author’s completely uneducated, pie in the sky, lark on a wing guesstimate. This figure represents the heads of the families, and does not include the multitude of their extended family, nor the favored minions that helped the reality of world tyranny blossom. These include soulless business people, politicians, law enforcement heavies, etc. etc. Also, shirts will still get dirty in this utopia/dystopia- widgets must still be packaged and tomatoes still be picked. However many support staff are required to adequately care for and provide manual labor to however many people are left after the population reduction plan is fully implemented is anyone’s guess. To deny such a plan is in place is to deny a great and ever growing body of evidence pointing to precisely this fact. If that is the case, then you are still in the “First Pasture of Perception”.

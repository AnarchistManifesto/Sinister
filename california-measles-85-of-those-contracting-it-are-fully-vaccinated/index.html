<a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2014/06/california-measles-85-of-those.html"><b>Activist Post</b></a></p>
<p>Saturday, June 14, 2014, around 10AM while having breakfast, this writer was listening to KYW 1060 All News Radio, a CBS affiliate in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, when to her great surprise she heard a news report that caught her off-guard.  Why off-guard?  Well, it was a report, plus statistic, regarding measles and the percentage of those contracting the disease who are fully vaccinated. Paraphrasing, the report went something like this, since she cannot locate it on the Internet or KYW’s home page: </p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p><b>The current all-time-high measles outbreak in California since measles was ‘eradicated’ due to vaccines and vaccinations, has local health authorities stumped          because 85% of those contracting measles were fully vaccinated!  </b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What an admission – and over the airwaves!  That’s something vaccine safety advocates have warned about but health authorities deliberately ignore while continually contending it is the non-vaccinated who are spreading measles.  Wake up, people! </p>
<p>In that unvarnished KYW news clip, the facts finally had been stated publicly, however, not to be reported again on KYW, and apparently sanitized from the radio station’s news reporting and archives. </p>
<p><a name="more"></a>So, why was such a candid statement about measles and vaccines/vaccinations permitted to slip through news monitoring filters?  Was it too early in the weekend schedule? Was the regular editor off duty?  Did someone who knows the real facts about news censorship controls allow it to slip through?  Who knows?  But, you can be certain that it apparently had to be pulled from further reporting because it was not in keeping with the party line regarding vaccines, vaccinations, and that non-vaccinated children are the cause of disease outbreaks. </p>

<p>
The report I heard mentioned that there were 80 cases of measles.  Trolling the Internet, I found that back in April of 2014 “a shocking 49 measles cases” [1] had been reported, “up from only four at this time last year”.  </p>
<p>Here’s something that authorities should implement immediately, I think: In any and all infectious disease case reports, it should be mandatory by HHS/CDC, plus state and local health authorities, to report the following: (a) whether the individual has been vaccinated; (b) the type(s) of vaccine(s); and (c) vaccination dates, since some infectious diseases can be caused by what’s referred to as <a href="http://www.vaccineriskawareness.com/Vaccine-Shedding">“shedding.”</a> </p>
<p><b>The Need for Accurate Statistical Reporting </b></p>

<p>In the <a href="http://pediatrics.about.com/od/measles/a/measles-outbreaks.htm">About.com Health Pediatrics Measles Outbreak 2014 website</a>, we see a listing of measles outbreaks in various U.S. localities, but it does not report how many individuals are/were vaccinated.  However, and rather ironically, some apparently irresponsible, rather aspersion-like comments are implied, it seems, toward the unvaccinated, e.g.: </p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>A <b><i>partially vaccinated</i></b> adult in Utah who contracted measles while traveling in Europe.     (2014) </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>Two cases of measles in Johnson County, Kansas, including an <b><i>unvaccinated child</i></b>.           (2014) </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>A <i><b>person </b></i>in Dauphin County, Pennsylvania <i><b>who exposed other people</b></i> in Harrisburg and Middletown. (2014) </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>Another case in Virginia, <b><i>an adult who exposed people </i></b>at a lot of places throughout          Fairfax, Loudoun and Arlington counties in Virginia; Montgomery County in Maryland    and Washington, D.C. (2014) </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>Two more cases in Clay County, Missouri, <i><b>the mother and sibling of an unvaccinated      infant who developed measles</b></i> after traveling out of the country. (2014)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>An <i><b>unvaccinated infant</b></i> in Clay County, Missouri who had recently returned from an       international trip. (2014) </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p><b>Someone, somewhere in Tennessee</b>. (2014) [What kind of <b><i>accurate statistic</i></b> is that?         Someone somewhere!  A rather unbelievable and unnerving statistical report.] </p>
<p>At least 32 people in six Ohio counties in an outbreak that began among <b><i>Amish </i></b>who had traveled to the Philippines. (2014) </p>
<p>At least 26 people in five Ohio counties in an outbreak that began among <b><i>Amish </i></b>who had             traveled to the Philippines. (2014) [Is this the same as the above?  Too coincidental!] </p>
<p><b><i>A partially vaccinated 19-month-old</i></b> in Hennepin County, Minnesota who had traveled    out of the country. (2014) </p>
<p>At least 13 people in Holmes County and Knox County, Ohio which began among an       <i><b>Amish-Mennonite</b></i> Organization that traveled to the Philippines. (2014) [Are these the       same people cited in two ‘statistics’ above?] </p>
<p><i><b>Another case</b></i> of measles in New York City. (2014)  [Vaccinated or not?] </p>
<p><i><b>An unvaccinated person</b></i> in Maricopa County, Arizona who had recently returned from     Europe and who likely exposed people at the Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport and other areas        in Phoenix and Scottsdale. (2014) </p>
<p>An <i><b>unvaccinated infant</b></i> who exposed others at the Portland International Airport. (2014) </p>
<p>Two more cases of measles in NYC, bringing the total case count to 21 – 10 kids and 11    adults, with <i><b>most of the children either intentionally not vaccinated or too young to be             vaccinated.</b></i> (2014) </p>
<p>Two unrelated cases with unknown sources in Farifield County, Connecticut, including    <b><i>an unvaccinated adult and a 7-month old infant, who was too young to be vaccinated.</i></b>          (2014) </p>
<p>An <i><b>unvaccinated man</b></i> in Rhode Island, who may have exposed people to measles at two area hospitals and a CVS in North Attleboro, Massachusetts. (2014) </p>

<p>Two more cases of measles among <b><i>the unvaccinated, quarantined students</i></b> at Crowne      Hill Elementary School in Temecula, California. (2014)   </p>

<p>A student at a Temecula, California elementary school, which has led to the quarantine of at least <b><i>10 other unvaccinated students.</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>An unvaccinated student</i></b> at the University of California, Berkeley who studied abroad in Asia and exposed others while attending classes and riding Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) between Tuesday, February 4 through Friday, February 7. </p>
<p>Two related cases in North Texas, including <b><i>an unvaccinated 12-month-old</i></b> in Collin         County, Texas who contracted measles on a trip out of the country. (2014)   </p>
<p><i><b>An unvaccinated young child</b></i> who may have exposed people to measles at Albany            Medical Center in New York. (2014) </p>
<p><i><b>An unvaccinated student</b></i> at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York. The        student had signed a waiver to allow them to attend the college without the otherwise required vaccine. (2014) </p>
<p><b>Someone in California – the first case of 2014.</b> [What kind of <b><i>accurate statistical</i></b>             reporting is that?  How about someone on the moon?] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>All the above are taken from [Note 2] with emphasis added by this writer.  However, the above             lengthy exercise includes only a small portion of the stats which appear on that      About.com website. What the above exercise is designed to point out is this:</p>
<p>Those who were not vaccinated; or those probably implied to not have been vaccinated,    e.g., the Amish; or those partially-vaccinated apparently were reported in order to make      them a ‘statistically-proven’ issue that unvaccinated or not-fully-vaccinated persons are causing outbreaks of measles or other diseases.<b> </b></p>
<p><b>What are the facts?</b></p>
<p>However, from an apparent statistical converse, readers rightfully may assume that those who contracted measles, but do not have vaccination status applied, were fully vaccinated.  If that’s the case, then the 85 percent measles contraction rate—or more—in California is valid and a statistical fact!  Furthermore, the media, health authorities and others should not invent nor parrot that the unvaccinated are the cause of current measles outbreaks across the country when, in actuality, it is the fully-vaccinated who are contracting measles. </p>
<p>Now, here’s the absolute and incriminating part about the media’s and health agencies’ ‘smoke and mirror’ statistics routine regarding their incredible ‘blame-games’: </p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>Percent of children ages 19-35 months vaccinated against measles, mumps,            rubella: <b>91% (2012) </b></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>Percent of adolescents ages 13-17 years vaccinated against measles, mumps, rubella           (2 doses or more): <b>91.4% (2012)</b>   [3] [CJF emphasis added] </p>
</blockquote>
<p><i><b>Folks, that’s just about the “full Monty” for the CDC’s ‘pie-in-the-sky’ ultimate ‘herd immunity’ status!</b></i></p>
<p>So, therefore, those who are spreading measles are not the unvaccinated by and large, but apparently the fully-vaccinated, so don’t let anyone tell you differently.  Their own figures prove it!  When will they realize that they can fool some of the people some of the time, but they can’t fool all the people all of the time?  </p>
<p>Parents are waking up to upmarket and incredible scare tactics and saying NO vaccines! That reaction probably is rightfully so in view of the adverse effects from vaccinations as attested to by the U.S. CDC’s VAERS reporting system [4], plus the almost <a href="http://www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation/statisticsreports.html">US $3 Billion paid out to settle vaccine damage claims by the U.S. Vaccine Court</a> and misinformation about research and statistics.  </p>
<p><i><b>Can Healthcare Consumers Trust CDC’s Vaccine Science? </b></i></p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/vaccinetruth.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" height="175" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-38G3VOJQToQ/TfAZ2bc-qRI/AAAAAAAAJQ8/LA-TGAvVeWk/250x250-b.jpg" width="200"></a>Despite all the peer-reviewed journal hype supporting vaccine safety, there also exists a body of scientific evidence that flies in the face of their apparent pseudo-science.  One area, in particular, concerns the toxic effects of a long-time-used preservative, Thimerosal, which is 49.6% ethylmercury, a neurotoxin. </p>
<p>The June 13, 2014 <b><i>Digital Journal</i></b> Press Release “CDC’s Vaccine Safety Research is Exposed as Flawed and Falsified in Peer-Reviewed Scientific Journal” [5] calls attention to the fact that Thimerosal is a “developmental neurotoxin” that’s been injected into infants and toddlers, plus adults, for many years, despite contentions that it’s been removed from vaccines. This writer <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2014/06/an-open-letter-to-congress-about.html">wrote an article</a> proving Thimerosal still is in some vaccines. </p>
<p>We seriously must consider the long-term implications from using Thimerosal in vaccines regarded as ‘safe’.  Can the neurotoxic effects of ethylmercury in Thimerosal have contributed to childhood neurodevelopmental problems, e.g., speech and language delay, ADHD, and autism? [5] Can Alzheimer’s be correlated with seniors who received annual flu shots containing other problematic toxins in vaccines for years? </p>
<p>According to Brian Hooker, PhD, et al, whose article “Methodological Issues and Evidence in Research Purporting to Show Thimerosal in Vaccines is Safe” was published in <i><b>BioMed Research International </b></i>[6],   </p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>There are over 165 studies that have focused on Thimerosal, an organic-mercury (Hg)        based compound, used as a preservative in many childhood vaccines, and found it to be harmful. [6] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dr. Hooker says, </p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>Each of these papers is fatally flawed from a statistics standpoint and <b>several of the        papers represent issues of scientific malfeasance.  For example, important data            showing a relationship between thimerosal exposure and autism are withheld from        three of the publications (Price et al. 2010, Verstraeten et al. 2003 and Madsen et al.     2003).</b>  This type of cherry-picking of data by the CDC in order to change the results of important research studies to support flawed and dangerous vaccination policies should not be tolerated.  [5]   [CJF emphasis added] </p>

</div>
<p>Furthermore, </p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>The CDC’s current stance that Thimerosal is safe and that there is no relationship   between Thimerosal and autism is based on six specific published epidemiological          studies coauthored and sponsored by the CDC. [6] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The last sentence above truly is <i><b>key </b></i>as to why parents—and everyone—should be questioning what is regurgitated by MDs, nurses, vaccine acolytes and apologists that vaccines are ‘safe’ or free of mercury.  Additionally, one has to question not only Thimerosal but numerous other toxins in all vaccines and how they negatively impact the central nervous system and basically ‘castrate’ the immune system by creating their interpretation of immunity—an adaptive immune response.

<p>Contraction of measles indicates the immune system has been compromised—if not addled by ineffective and/or unsafe mandated childhood vaccines with neurotoxins and toxic chemicals.  Otherwise, measles and other infectious diseases would not occur in partially- or fully-vaccinated vaccinees, who contract and can spread diseases for which they have been vaccinated against, e.g., pertussis—whooping cough. </p>
<p>No wonder California health authorities are perplexed.  They cannot believe that their fairytales about vaccines are not holding true.  If you ask me, I think everyone needs a reality check when it comes to what amounts to a religious belief system that perpetuates the vaccine meme. </p>
<p>Finally, I’d like to introduce another dimension as to why infectious diseases may be on the upswing.  The culprit is chemtrails—those chemical trails in the sky sprayed as part of weather geo-engineering.  </p>
<p>The particulates sprayed, including nanoparticles, are breathed into our lungs and impact our immune system thereby creating heretofore unknown biological anomalies and probable altered immune responses.  Couple the aforesaid with vaccine-created “adaptive immunity responses” and humans probably are heading toward no immunity capabilities. </p>
<p>Here’s a <a href="http://www.stopsprayingcalifornia.com/What_are_they_Spraying.php">listing of chemicals and toxic metals being sprayed in California</a> and probably along the entire West Coast thereby contributing to outbreaks of other infectious diseases in Oregon, Washington State and elsewhere in the USA.   </p>
<p>The chemical and biological interactions taking place in the human race as a whole comprise one gigantic experiment that no one knows how—or if—it will end. </p>

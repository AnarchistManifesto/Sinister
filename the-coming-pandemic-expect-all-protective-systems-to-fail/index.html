<p>The attacks of September 11 were quickly followed by a biological weapons attack in which government-grade weaponized anthrax killed five people and sickened numerous others.</p>
<p>This attack, the genesis of which remains unsolved ten years later, was used to justify the United States Congress pumping over $60 billion dollars into a “biodefense “ program which has failed in every parameter that can be measured.</p>
<p>In fact, it appears that all purportedly protective measures, developed nationally and internationally, have fatal flaws in their design which may function to ensure the likelihood and success of a biological weapons attack.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><b>On The Domestic Front</b></p>
<div style="float: left;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-right: 1em">
</div>
<p>
Even the commission created by Congress in 2007 to evaluate all defenses for chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats gave our biodefense program a failing grade.</p>
<p>Ten years after the anthrax mailings (which went to Congressmen who might have voted against the USA Patriot Act, as well as to certain media outlets), the US has not even developed a second generation anthrax vaccine.  Over 100 million dollars has been allocated to develop this vaccine, but ten years after the biological weapons attack on our country our vaccine stockpiles consist of smallpox vaccines as well as the original anthrax vaccine (reputed to cause Gulf War syndrome) and little else. (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/30/magazine/how-ready-are-we-for-bioterrorism.html?pagewanted=all">Source</a>) </p>
<p>Authorized under the Bush administration, Project BioWatch has developed and placed sensors in a number of large cities to serve as an advance detection system for an airborne biological attack, but this program has come under scrutiny and critics have alleged that this may be useless due to prior knowledge of the sensor locations by terror groups.</p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>Since 9/11, there has also been a proliferation of what are called “biosafety labs” (BSL’s) level threes and fours. The 3’s and 4’s, so designated because of the enhanced safety protocols at use in the advanced level labs, handle the most dangerous bugs known to man.  There are at least 17 such BSL-4’s now in the US and, according to documents released by the DOJ and DOE, over 1350 BSL-3’s.  These numbers are dramatically up since the events of September 2001.</p>
<p>The US government <a href="http://www.selectagents.gov/Select%20Agents%20and%20Toxins%20List.html">maintains a list of pathogens and toxins</a> which have the potential of causing grave harm to human or plant life. The Center for Disease Control is mandated to keep track of labs handling select agents, but is very cagey in terms of releasing the information about the numbers and locations of these facilities, preferring instead to tender <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2011/06/concerns-continue-to-mount-on-us.html">denials and offer false information </a>when confronted with the proliferation of these labs.</p>
<p>There is  evidence that the US has developed an aggressive biological weapons program, despite our government’s insistence that we abandoned our bioweapons program forty years ago, under President Nixon. The evidence may be found at Sierra Army Depot (and other military bases) where these weapons appear to be stockpiled.<b> </b></p>
<p><b>Locking in on the Threat</b></p>
<p>There is growing alarm among certain sectors that the US may be planning another  “event” using biological weapons, and may attempt to either blame this on terrorists or on some sort of “natural” epidemic.  It therefore becomes imperative to determine what sort of attack we may be facing and what we can do to protect ourselves.</p>
<p>According to Dr. Kenneth Alibek, a Russian scientist who came over to this side of the fence and is now working on biological weapons issues at Battelle, there are essentially three ways in which a biological attack could be launched. Writes Alibek:</p>
<div style="float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><a href="http://activistpost.net/bestlittlefilter.html"><img alt="" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-3hAqTJRcPXE/TqRErvNHVZI/AAAAAAAALpg/3FEUEDfJMKk/s200/pocketfilter.jpg"></a></div>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>Biological weapons can deployed in three ways: </p>
<ul>
<li>contamination of food or water supplies, which are then ingested by the victims </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<ul>
<li>release of infected vectors, such as mosquitoes or fleas, which then bite the victims </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<ul>
<li>creation of an aerosol cloud, which is then inhaled by the victims (or if the targets are plants, the cloud then settles on and infects the plants). [<a href="http://thewednesdayreport.com/articles/research/weapons_of_mass_destruction-super_diseases.htm">Source</a>]</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The probability of a general airborne attack is unlikely.  An airborne attack could not be easily controlled and carries the strong likelihood of affecting unintended targets.  One must therefore look at other delivery systems that carry an ability to lock onto the desired targets and pass over those who have been predesignated to survive.</p>
<p>Work on reconfiguring the water system, countrywide, began right about the same time as the US signed onto the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) in the early 1970s. This reconfigured <a href="http://neworleans.indymedia.org/news/2007/05/10214.php">“double line” water system</a> provides the opportunity for a nearly “surgical” attack on predetermined targets.</p>
<div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin-bottom: 10px">
<!-- AP WP Responsive --><ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-1897954795849722" data-ad-slot="4254280269" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>
<p>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || ).push({});
</p></div>
<p>Possibly advancing to the top of the list in terms of all-time government deception was President Nixon’s public announcement in 1969 that the US was ending its biological weapons program.  It is now apparent that  at the same time that President Nixon disavowed our bioweapons program and the US ratified the BWC, plans were being developed and executed to lay down a second main line in cities and towns throughout America, and plans to use the water system as a delivery system were cemented.</p>
<p>A chemist in Eastern Washington State, Dave Duncan, had volunteered in 2006 to run chemical analyses on samples of water which had ostensibly come from the mixture of the two water mains. His initial tests revealed that the specific gravity of the sample was significantly skewed when compared to normal tap water. Duncan, a fundamentalist Christian, became concerned about the implications of his work, declaring that “if people were going to be killed off, it must be God’s will.” Shortly after vacating his work on analyzing the water sample, Duncan succumbed to an aggressive form of colon cancer.</p>
<p>Another delivery system has been uncovered, which may dovetail with the double line water system, for the delivery of a lethal dose of toxins or chemicals. For numerous medications being manufactured by Big Pharma, there are now imposter “death drugs” being quietly manufactured, as well. These look-alike doppelgangers, which appear identical to the antibiotic, analgesic, hormonal, cardiac or other common medication, will produce a heart attack and/or stroke and — most likely — subsequent death.</p>
<p>Both water as a delivery system and the imposter pharmaceuticals bear the necessary targeting capability. The double line water system provides the ability to selectively target households and the pharmaceutical delivery system provides the ability to selectively target individuals.</p>
<p>None of the 60 billion dollars pumped into biodefense in the last ten years appears to be designated to address waterborne attacks. A recent announcement from DHS Chief <a href="http://www.homelandsecuritynewswire.com/dhs-warns-utilities-risk-insider-threats">Janet Napolitano</a> declared that “dangerous terrorists” had infiltrated the utility companies and were planning an attack.  The Department of Homeland Security was subsequently contacted and details were turned over to that agency as to how this could very well occur via water utilities, given the vulnerability inherent in the double line water system. There has been no response from Napolitano or the DHS. <b> </b></p>

<p>It appears the wagons have also circled around the involvement of the pharmaceutical companies in biological weapons work.  As there are no weapons inspectors or any other implementation vehicle for the BWC, the pharmaceutical companies can carry on their death work without the intrusion of any Peeping Tom inspection team. The glaring failure of the BWC to provide a means of implementing the treaty has resulted in a complete lack of oversight as to what is going on in pharmaceutical labs. In the past, attempts to set up an inspection capability for the BWC have been vigorously opposed by the United States and also by . . . you guessed it — the pharmaceutical companies.

<p>The development and production of biological weapons would necessitate, of course, a laboratory to produce them.  Certain industries maintain such labs, such as pharmaceutical companies and some food production companies.  Big Pharma has consistently objected to the spectre of weapons inspectors coming into their labs, stating that such weapons inspectors could, in fact, be industrial spies bent on stealing proprietary drug information. Bending to the stated necessity of keeping the profits of the pharmaceutical companies secure along with their proprietary formulas, the BWC has so far accommodated the pharmaceutical companies in their insistence on the priority of maintaining their privacy and profit margins, granting this imperative more weight than the need to keep the world safe from biological weapons.</p>
<p>However, given the revelation of the “death drug” imposter pill program, we can see why the pharmaceutical industry would balk at weapons inspectors peering over its shoulders.</p>

<p>This December, the BWC will be meeting again in Geneva, as it does only every five years.  On the table will be strengthening the “confidence building measures,” (CBM’s) which have taken the place of inspection teams as a means to ensure treaty compliance. The problem is that the CBM’s rely on the integrity of each nation to accurately report on its own programs.  In plain language, that means that we must “trust” the word of countries such as the United States, Russia, Great Britain, Iran, Pakistan and South Africa to accurately report what is going on in their labs.</p>
<p>The very term “confidence building measures”  is possibly one of the most offensive and misleading parts of the staged drama that is the BWC.  Forty years after the BWC treaty originally came into existence, we still have no means of ensuring any kind of compliance with the mandates of the treaty, other than the “word” of a possible offender.  In a recent interview with a former CIA contractor, who has asked his name not be used here, this top-level scientist who worked for years as a CIA asset admitted that it was known in intelligence circles that the old Soviet Union under Yeltsin was violating the BWC. This was never brought to the attention of the international community through the BWC.</p>
<p>The three nations which serve as depositories of the BWC are Russia, Great Britain and the United States.  Great Britain may have recently ducked an international scandal when a South African physician, Dr. Wouter Basson, was exonerated of war crimes charges for his work developing biological weapons with Project Coast during the apartheid years. Basson was purportedly involved in developing a “blacks-only” bioweapon, which would only kill native Africans and leave white people unscathed. Sources in the US government have contacted this reporter alleging that such a weapon is now at play and has been leaked into processed foods. The substance allegedly bonds with melanin (which is present in darker skinned peoples) producing hypertension and diabetes. Indeed, the present epidemic of these two “silent killers” is nearly unknown in Africa, where the native population does not eat such a preponderance of processed foods, relying instead on more natural food sources. Africa, as we know, is being emptied out by the AIDS epidemic.</p>
<p>Dr. Basson, it appears, was chummy with Dr. David Kelly, the British biological weapons inspector whose sudden <a href="https://dr-david-kelly.blogspot.com/">“suicide”</a> may well have been an effort to obscure the evidence of <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=7155">a cooperative effort</a> between the South African bioweapons program and England ().</p>
<p>Come December, the Big Three — Russia, Great Britain and the US — will meet with other nations to convene their deadly serious effort of making the world safe from biological weapons.  Or, that is what they want us to believe, anyway.</p>
<p>The reality is that, through its failure to enact implementation protocols, the BWC is enabling the development of precisely the type of weaponry that it is mandated to curtail.</p>
<div style="font-family: inherit"><u><b>Correction: </b></u></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit">The article stated that the violations of the BWC by the Soviet Union were never brought to the attention of the BWC. In fact, there were many discussions held at the BWC concerning the Soviet’s biological weapons program.  Dr. David Kelly, whose untimely death was also referenced in the article, was involved in investigations into the Soviet violations of the BWC and was a member of inspection teams which visited the former Soviet Union between 1991-1994.</div>

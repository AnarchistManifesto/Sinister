<b><a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2012/12/its-time-for-aware-to-take-action.html">Activist Post</a></b></p>
<p>For anyone who is even passively aware of current events and the condition of humanity across the globe, it is abundantly clear that both the nation and the world as a whole are moving further and further into a state of oppression and total lockdown.</p>
<p>From the traditional macro-events which are taking place at the international and global levels to the micro-events (or seemingly micro) that are taking place at the national, state, and local arenas, the opportunity for optimism in the outcome of the decisions made seems to be few and far between.</p>
<p>Indeed, in order to find areas where battles are won by those on the ground fighting against an encroaching police state, further pollution of the environment, war, proliferation of GMOs, or related causes, one must search on average one hundred times harder than would otherwise be necessary to locate the news of another defeat. The headlines from both the mainstream and alternative media outlets suggest only greater accomplishments of the system (New World Order/Anglo-American Establishment/Shadow World Government, etc.) with each passing day.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>Obviously, the mainstream media is intent and focused on the further brainwashing and propagandizing of the world’s people, blatantly promoting their enslavement for those who are aware of the methods used, further implanting the accepted opinions of the future in the minds of the masses who are not. The constant replay of a laundry list of possible catastrophes – those that have occurred and those that might occur – serve to wrap the human mind in a cloak of continual panic and subconscious desire to protect oneself by any means necessary.</p>

<p>
That method of protection, of course, is readily served up by the mainstream media under the guise of sacrificing freedom for security, which the victims of the propaganda continue to fall for on an ever-increasing scale. Whether the initial incident is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU48jWXYyeA">9/11</a>, <a href="http://www.prisonplanet.com/americans-turn-in-guns-after-school-massacre.html">mass shootings</a>, flu outbreaks,[1] or financial calamity, the unchanging trend is FEAR and the unchanging solution is the sacrifice of basic human rights under the guise that government, its agents or agencies, will act as the protectors.</p>
<p>It has been the case ever since 9/11, most notably, that the population has been subjected to a campaign of terror by their governments, corporations, “experts,” and financiers. Fear is the order of the day. An entire generation of humanity has been reduced to a terrified and ignorant mass of beggars, pleading with what they see as “authorities” to protect them from the very dangers the oligarchy themselves have visited upon them.</p>
<p>This constant state of fear allows those few in positions of real power to control the many by virtue of the reptilian brain, which at all times seeks safety, protection, and survival. If a population has been propagandized to believe in an enemy, real or imagined, and then subjected to terror under the aegis of that enemy, then the minds of the many are ready molds in the hands of the few.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/familysurvival.html" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ASIFGy_z7zU/UCFiDQK8GBI/AAAAAAAAROU/7AHejVY_hUE/s202/3.gif"></a>A constant state of fear clouds clear judgment. It does not allow for rational responses, only irrational reactions. A continual state of fear <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/video/asia/2011/12/201112136012364220.html">wrecks the body</a>, the <a href="http://www.your-health-news.net/live-well/how-stress-affects-your-immune-system/">immune system</a>, and the quality of life experienced by those embroiled in the condition. In the end, the fear that has wrecked the body will only produce more fear with the inevitable illness that results.</p>
<p>Lastly, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGWcUwnSUzo">according to some</a>, fear operates at a much lower vibration than that of love, joy, and contentment. Thus, an individual caught in a cycle of fear is entirely incapable of achieving any higher level of consciousness that may allow them to combat the control system on a spiritual or energetic level.</p>
<p>The alternative media, however, which has expanded exponentially in recent years, has done yeomen’s service in combating much of the propaganda issued from their corporate counterparts. Whether the issue be one of those mentioned above or some other aspect of our society, the alternative media is filling a void left by the corporate mainstream media. There is no question that the alternative media is providing a vital service for any movement or revolution that is to take place in the United States or any other nation.</p>
<p>However, for those of us actively involved in the alternative media and this movement that seeks to establish a more peaceful, equitable, and free world for ourselves and our progeny, it is important that we do not become that which we fight against. It is important that we do not become tools of the system ourselves and contribute to establishing a constant state of fear for those who access alternative media outlets for their information or even for those of us who research, report, and comment upon it.</p>
<p>This is by no means a suggestion to cease reporting or researching unpleasant topics. On the contrary, we must continue to unearth and shed light on nefarious secrecy whenever possible. We must continue to report the day-to-day events with a lens undiluted by government and corporate money or by any agenda other than that of basic humanity and freedom. We must continue to acknowledge and sound the alarm over current events that others may be unaware of or otherwise dis-informed.</p>
<p>However, it is now necessary that we do more than simply report on the recently unveiled methods of enslavement that we face along with an eye as to how much worse our plight will be tomorrow. We cannot continue to terrorize ourselves into a state of hysteria, to become a sizable portion of society whose eyes are now opened but only so that we can see our inevitable destruction.</p>
<p>I do not believe our destruction is inevitable.</p>
<p>As a result, I demand to see a way forward, not new and creative ways to solidify the fact that I am a slave.</p>
<p>The alternative media and “the movement” (for lack of a better term) have become experts at documenting the daily dissolution of our rights. We have become skilled artisans in the area of constructing a journal of our plight. Unfortunately, it is also true that, in our current state, the best we can hope for may be that, in the distant future, some curious observer (if curiosity still exists)  may come into contact with our work and puzzle at the curious writings that have come into his possession. But this is no future for us and it is no future for the one who discovers the remnants of a past to which he can no longer relate.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in becoming experts at journal keeping during the collapse and restructuring of human civilization, the alternative media and the modern revolutionary have seemingly become content to merely report the unfolding history as opposed to actively taking part in it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bloggersecret.com/" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-LzwETzr-AZA/T8kFjEDSzoI/AAAAAAAAPEY/2DMHHoOE2nw/s300/300x250_v001.gif" width="200"></a>Thankfully, there are those involved in both the alternative media and the movement in general who are not only willing to hear solutions but are both willing and capable of producing them. Still, scarcely are those voices raised before catcalls of pessimism are hurled back in their direction. Shouts of “that will never happen,” and “but how do we get to that point?” or “we don’t have the numbers” inevitably drown out those that are at least attempting to develop a plan to change the course of the nation and the earth. Obviously, petty squabbles over political pedigree are bound to come into play, with tendencies left over from past experiences, further alienating activists and researchers from one another.</p>
<p>Yet, for all of the bickering back and forth, the fact is that numbers alone will not bring change if they are merely numbers in their own right. As Webster Tarpley has stated on numerous occasions, opinions alone count for nothing. What matters is coordinated political action.</p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>Simple education and outreach is not enough. If we can reach the majority of the public, we have accomplished a great feat. However, if all we have accomplished is educating them in regards to their fate, with no coordinated effort to reverse the course of society, then we have only wasted our energy and made our descent into abject slavery that much more painful a process.</p>
<p>With this is in mind, it is important to understand that there can be no coordinated action based on a series of complaints. Every mass movement needs a program; a set of demands. It is in no way prudent to take to the streets with a series of complaints and no programmatic solution of how to address these complaints. To the uninformed masses, the question looms like an albatross: “What are you going to do if you seize power?” It is incumbent upon those of us involved in redirecting this system to answer that question clearly with a program of our own. After all, as Frederick Douglass once stated, “Power concedes nothing without a demand.”</p>
<p>Thus, it is high time to put our personal differences aside, as well as our philosophical and political ideologies, and begin to form a coalition around a set of demands that both appeals to the American people and articulates a program that will return the basic civil liberties afforded to every American in the United States Constitution as well as the basic human rights afforded to every human being by the Creator (whatever one believes it to be) by virtue of being born.</p>
<p>We must begin to build a coalition of like-minded individuals and organizations, but also of those people and organizations that are further afield, in order to advance our own political agenda. A united front must be constructed where the individuals and organizations retain their individuality and independence, but one in which they have come together under one common banner with the ability to unite their forces for a common purpose.</p>
<p>Thankfully, this model has already begun to appear in at least two locations across the world with at least some degree of success. The first, the Syriza party of Greece, represents a grouping of political parties, activist organizations, unions, and other arrangements that alone counted for nothing in terms of political clout. When united under a common front – the Syriza party – these organizations were able to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-18482415">accumulate over 40%</a> of the vote in the first election campaign.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/chickenkeepingsecrets.html" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/_qLAIskTQXUc/TbGojzPRwBI/AAAAAAAAIZU/9aW8PQ1223o/small-square.gif"></a> exhibited several necessary ingredients to the formation of a successful coalition, most notably that of <a href="http://tarpley.net/2012/05/12/greeces-syriza-left-bloc-5-point-program-for-austerity-rollback/">a program that spelled out the steps and requirements to end austerity</a> measures in Greece and repair the damage done to the Greek economy by the banker-dominated government at home and in Brussels.</p>
<p>Syriza exhibited expert leadership with the Presidential candidate Alexis Tsipras in front and center of its electoral and public relations campaign. It also demonstrated the ability to reach across national boundaries to connect with similar coalitions and organizations outside of Greece for potential international support.</p>
<p>The fact that Syriza has enjoyed so much success early on in Greek elections not only provides us with much-needed hope regarding our own situation, it also provides us with the ability to analyze which models work and which models do not, along with the ability to analyze how this degree of success was accomplished.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are some who have learned the lessons of Syriza here in the United States and, as a result, a coalition has been organized and developed within our own borders. Based on the Syriza model, the <a href="http://www.againstausterity.org/">United Front Against Austerity</a> (UFAA) has itself constructed a set of demands and a program of political solutions. The UFAA is currently working to agitate alongside a variety of organizations that have themselves been splintered by stealthy politics and propaganda on the part of the oligarchy. The UFAA is attempting to build its own base and circle of influence.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.againstausterity.org/program">The UFAA’s program</a> is one that stands against austerity measures and the cutting and gutting of the social safety net. It is one which exhibits the best aspects of the New Deal, while drastically improving upon the economic rejuvenation features of that historical program. The program also demands Medicare For All, the de-militarization of police, the restoration of civil liberties to the American people, an end to foreign wars, and a more enlightened approach to health and medicine that includes holistic and alternative methods.</p>
<p>However, the UFAA, as anyone building a coalition of this nature should be, is aware that a truly successful political mobilization of the American people can only be structured around the economic issues that they face; not false flag attacks, wars, education, the environment, or any other topic of concern, as important as they may be.</p>
<p>Coalitions centered around false flags face the uphill battle of massive and in-depth education efforts before any mobilization is possible. Anti-war, education and environmentally-based coalitions generally rely on only a quarter of the potential support due to the disassociation and apathy experienced and expressed by most of the populace toward these concerns, at least in terms of political participation.</p>
<p>Economic concerns, however, are the one issue that not only affects every single American, but it is the one issue that most Americans perceive as affecting <i>them</i>. For this reason, any coalition that wishes to attract broad support must use economic solutions to build itself up and ride a wave of popular support into power. In addition, it is important to understand that Austrian school economics of laissez-faire capitalism, deregulation of the banking and finance industry, and the cutting and gutting of social safety programs cannot and should not be used to build such a coalition. Not only are the moral implications disastrous for everyone except the very wealthy, such programs are not likely to win the support of the American people, many of whom may actually rely on one or more of these programs as a last line of defense against homelessness, hunger, or extreme poverty.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/ultimatesurvivalplan.html" style="float: right;margin-left: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em" target="_blank"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ffz4KfJxfQA/T7GjTjynqmI/AAAAAAAAO20/I8glkQdVOPU/s250/250x200.gif" alt=""></a>Lastly, the forming of a true coalition must be undertaken with much more than mere elections in mind. It is a fact that any and all social and political movements in the United States are vastly stronger without the Republican and Democratic parties, as the failure of the Union protests in Wisconsin have illustrated. Thus, while elections will inevitably enter into the picture, they must also inevitable exclude the two major parties. The most pressing matter facing any coalition, like the United Front Against Austerity, is a forcing of the issues into the mainstream and the seizing of power by the coalition in the vacuum that will ensue.</p>
<p>The method of the coalition must be the general strike. If the coalition merely becomes a lobbying group for the two major parties, then the effort is wasted. If it becomes merely another third party, the effort is equally useless. However, if the coalition is able to become a force within its own right, a part, and an organization which can command the workers into the streets, then the path toward victory is real and attainable.</p>

<p>There’s a time when the operation of the machine becomes so odious, makes you so sick at heart, that you can’t take part! You can’t even passively take part! And you’ve got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels…upon the levers, upon all the apparatus, and you’ve got to make it stop! And you’ve got to indicate to the people who run it, to the people who own it, that unless you’re free, the machine will be prevented from working at all!</p>
<p>The United States now finds itself in a crisis. It is true that the crisis exists on multiple levels and it is true that we are surrounded by an American population that seems oblivious to it. However, as Rahm Emmanuel, the former Obama Chief of Staff and current mayor of Chicago <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yeA_kHHLow">has stated</a>, “You never want a serious crisis to go to waste.” But the question to be asked is, “Why should the oligarchs be the only ones to take advantage of a crisis?” If Rahm Emmanuel can seize the fear and emotion surrounding a crisis, then why can a coordinated coalition of organizations and individuals not do the same?</p>
<p>If the 33rd Degree of Freemasonry can profess to create Order out of Chaos (Ordo ab Chao), then why can we not do the same where that chaos exists?</p>
<p>In the end, we have a very small window of opportunity opening up before us. We also have some hard choices to make. We can continue to document our own destruction, or we can mount a resistance to it.</p>
<p>We can continue to make a detailed journal of the dissolution of our way of life, or we can organize in its defense.</p>
<p>The time for talking has passed.</p>
<p>It is now time for action.</p>

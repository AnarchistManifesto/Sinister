<i>Government funded tetanus vaccines, Keynan Catholic Bishops and miscarriages. How are these things connected to one another? </i><br />
<i></i><br />
When Catholic bishops in Kenya issued a <a href="http://www.kccb.or.ke/home/news-2/press-statement-5/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a> last month questioning their government’s internationally-funded <a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/anti-therapeutic-action/vaccination-tetanus" target="_blank">tetanus vaccine</a>  campaign directed at women and girls and warned that it might be laced  with an experimental contraceptive that makes them miscarry their  babies, it was barely mentioned by the mainstream media outside of  Kenya. The BBC carried a brief <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-29594091" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">story</a>  that dismissed the allegations as “unfounded” and suggested that even  raising such questions was dangerous as it could frighten people from a  “safe and certified” lifesaving vaccine.</p>
<p>The few bloggers that gave the bishops any attention were mostly accusatory, like the “<a href="//www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/200/14/catholic-church-in-kenya-opposes-tetanus-vaccinations-suspectting-a-secreht-plan-to-sterilize-women/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">friendly atheist</a>” who  compared them to Muslim fundamentalists who had somehow got it into  their paranoid heads that the West was trying to render them infertile. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If  beggars believe that these men think that one day they’ll get  high-fives from their Maker despite the death and suffering they  willfully [sic] created,” he concluded.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The larger  Catholic church was silent and no human rights groups rushed to  investigate the bishops’ claims, so the whole  controversy seemed to  evaporate like smog – a backward, African version of a wacky vaccine  conspiracy theory, with Catholic anti-birth control overtones. What  could poor, black women have to fear from uber-rich white  philanthropists and global organizations bearing health-giving  pharmaceuticals after all?</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><b>BLACK BOX MEDICINE</b></p>
<p>Well,  there is that niggling 60-year history of contraceptive testing on poor,  mostly black women in developing countries. Practically every  contraceptive ever marketed to Western women was first tried out on some  unsuspecting and undereducated poor women, often without access to  running water, let alone basic healthcare or a lawyer.</p>

<p>From the  revolutionary first birth control pill, experimented on Haitian and  Puerto Rican women in the 1950s (who suffered blood clots and strokes  while the researchers adjusted the doses to make it saleable), through  the now-shelved hormone-leaking Norplant rods inserted in the arms of  Bangladeshi slum women in the early 1980s, some of whom, going blind or  endlessly bleeding, were refused when they begged to have the things  removed, to the women and girls in rural Ghana who were part of the  “Navrongo Experiment” between 1994 and 2006 and, <a href="http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/group-accuses-gates-foundation-usaid-of-hiding-injectable-contraceptiv1/#ixzz3IDli1yK1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">according to black activists</a>,  left conveniently unaware of the FDA’s Black Box Warning about  life-threatening potential side effects of the experimental Depo Provera  contraceptive implant they were given as part of a “general health  care” program. It seems that the poor women are always involved except  when the pharmaceutical company is paying the lawsuit claims.  </p>
<p>Or  perhaps the Kenyan bishops were thinking of the nasty side population  controllers sometimes shown when they’re in Third World countries. There  are nice population control people in places like India who will give  men <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2008/mar/29/india-uses-gun-license-as-sterilization-incentive/?page=allor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">guns for vasectomies</a> or women a <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/india/8610957/India-offers-cars-and-TV-sets-for-sterilisation.htmlh-" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">chance to win a refrigerator</a>  or the world’s cheapest car for surgical sterilization.  But then there  are the population control jihads, like the type that saw Indian men  forcibly sterilized on railway platforms in the 1970s in the quest to  defuse the “population bomb.”  They still oversee <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fmnGeK2cBM" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">programs today</a>  where Indian women are dumped like chattel on the streets after  surgical sterilization “mega camps” or left bleeding on straw mats after  tubal ligations at a rate of <a href="http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/u.s.-u.k.-foreign-aid-tied-to-indias-forced-sterilization-campaign/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">two-per-minute, by flashlight.</a></p>
<p>Maybe  the Kenyan bishops were thinking of the way US and international  foreign aid and private foundation funding has steadily trickled into  these countries in the billions, while these type of government-run  programs that reduce birth rates are in full swing. But why would they  ever suspect foreign-funded programs in Kenya?  And why were they so  concerned about the tetanus campaign?</p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>“Is there a tetanus crisis  in Kenya? If this is so, why has it not been declared?” the bishops  asked, noting that the Catholic Church’s 83 health centres, 311  dispensaries and 17 medical training centres that had not heard about  it. Also, if “so many life threatening diseases [are] in Kenya, why has  tetanus been prioritized?”</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/vaccinetruth.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 0em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" height="175" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-38G3VOJQToQ/TfAZ2bc-qRI/AAAAAAAAJQ8/LA-TGAvVeWk/250x250-b.jpg" width="200"></a>Fair enough questions. Then they got weird:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We  are not convinced that the government has taken adequate responsibility  to ensure that Tetanus Toxoid vaccine (TT) laced with Beta human  chorionic gonadotropin (b-HCG) sub unit is not being used by the  sponsoring development partners. This has previously been used by the  same partners in the Philippines, Nicaragua and Mexico to vaccinate  women against future pregnancy. Beta HCG sub unit is a hormone necessary  for pregnancy.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The notion of a contraceptive-laced vaccine sounds ridiculous to most Westerners. What are they talking about? </p>
<p><b>BACKGROUND</b></p>
<p>“The population growth and unintended pregnancies are major public health issues worldwide,” begins this <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3110624/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">2011 overview</a>  of contraceptive vaccines in the American Journal of Reproductive  Immunology. “Contraceptive vaccines (CV) have been proposed as valuable  alternatives that can fulfill most, if not all, of the properties of an  ideal contraceptive. As the developed and most of the developing nations  have an infrastructure for mass immunization, the development of  vaccines for contraception is an exciting proposition.”</p>
<p>Indeed, a  contraceptive vaccine is a sort of “Holy Grail” for population  researchers. It turns out they’ve been beavering away at this technology  since the 1960s and they have made some significant inroads. They’ve  developed three different types of vaccines against pregnancy:</p>
<ul>
<li>   One against women’s eggs</li>
<li>   One against sperm</li>
<li>   One against early embryos (trophoblasts) that induces very early miscarriage</li>
</ul>
<p>The  egg vaccines turned out to be the most troublesome.  “Our goal with our  vaccine was to develop autoimmunity,” Bonnie Dunbar, a 20-year veteran  vaccine researcher, told the 4th International Public Conference on  Vaccination in 2010, according to a <a href="http://pop.org/content/blasted-ovaries-failure-of-contraceptive-1960" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>  from a Population Research Institute reporter who was there. Dunbar had  entered the field with aims of curtailing population growth and said  that she wanted to train rabbits’ immune systems to attack their own  zona pellucida glycoproteins on their ova, as it happens sometimes in  infertile women. She used pig proteins in her vaccine, just foreign  enough to “trick the rabbit into inducing antibodies against its own  self proteins.”</p>
<p>It turned out to be too effective.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We  found out when we immunized these animals, however, that we completely  destroyed the ovaries,” Dunbar said. “Unfortunately, we weren’t just  looking at preventing fertilization now; we generated a complete  autoimmune disease, which is also known as premature ovarian failure.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In  every animal model she tested the vaccine in, including primates, it  caused permanent autoimmune failure of the ovaries induced by their own  bodies. After viewing the slides of these blasted ovaries, Dr. Dunbar  called it quits.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I am responsible,” she declared,  “for killing this vaccine for further human research, and I made some  people in my biotech company and some other people very unhappy.”</p>

<p>“Vaccination  with these sperm antigens (recombinant/synthetic peptide/DNA) causes a  reversible contraceptive effect in females and males of various animal  species, by inducing a systemic and local antisperm antibody response.”</p>
<p>One lab has even managed to produce a <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12135913" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">nasal spray vaccine that renders mice infertile</a>.</p>
<p>In fact, the anti-sperm vaccines have been so successful that the US Environmental Protection Agency <a href="http://www.humanesociety.org/news/press_releases/2012/02/EPA_Announces_First_Fertility_Control_Vaccine_for_Wild_Horses.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a>  in 2012 that it registered a contraceptive vaccine for use on wild  horses which is now currently being tested on elephants in South Africa.</p>
<p>But  most promising of all have been the anti-human chorionic gonadotropin  hormone (hCG) vaccines – the kind the Kenyan bishops are worried about.  “Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) appears soon after fertilization of  the egg and plays a critical role in implantation of the embryo,  explains a <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23302029" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">2013 report in the Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences.</a></p>
<p>Flooded by the hCG hormone during pregnancy, women’s immune systems  won’t attack it because it is natural and facilitates a newly conceived  embryo implanting in its mother’s womb. To overcome this immunological  tolerance, researchers attached a subunit of hCG to the tetanus toxoid  in a tetanus vaccine to trick the immune system into making antibodies  that would attack hCG, and cause early miscarriage.</p>
<p>In Gursuran  Talwar’s article from the Talwar Research Foundation in New Delhi,  India, Talwar has been researching contraceptive vaccines for  organizations including the World Health Organization and the Population  Council for decades and published his first paper on an hCG  contraceptive vaccine in 1976 – coincidentally when the WHO launched its  anti-neonatal tetanus campaign targeting women of childbearing age.</p>
<p>Neonatal  tetanus is unheard of in Western countries. It still claims many  infants in the developing world, however, mostly because of squalid  delivery conditions, co-infections like malaria and maternal malnutrition, including vitamin A deficiency and anemia.[2] The  typical Western response to a deep-rooted problem like this: vaccinate.</p>
<p><b>CONTROVERSY</b></p>
<p>Talwar  began testing his hCG contraceptive on Indian women as far back as 1990  when he found that of the 148 women inoculated with his anti-hCG  vaccine, none conceived so long as they received regular boosters at  intervals of a few months to keep their antibody titers high enough.</p>
<p>Soon  after these experiments, the controversies began. In the mid 1990s, the  World Health Organization, in partnership with other international  groups, including UNICEF, rolled out anti-tetanus vaccine campaigns in  developing countries including the Philippines. Women and girls of  child-bearing age only were recruited for multiple tetanus vaccine  injections just months apart – not the usual tetanus vaccine schedules  several years apart – in order to prevent neonatal tetanus.</p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>According  to a 1995 BBC investigation [1], some health workers in the Philippines  began to notice that women were miscarrying after the vaccine and they  grew suspicious. Eventually, the Philippine Medical Association  retrieved 47 vials of the vaccine and had them tested in an FDA-approved  laboratory. Nine of the vials were found to contain the hCG subunit.  The WHO and other global health organizations involved vehemently denied  the claim, but when the PMA sent their lab results in September 1996  they admitted that the hCG was there, but it was in such small  quantities that it was just “background noise.”</p>
<p>Similar  allegations surfaced in Nicaragua and Mexico. So when the tetanus  vaccine for girls came to Kenya, the Catholic bishops complained to the  Minster of Health who insisted that the vaccine should be tested before  the campaign, but the WHO declined and withdrew the campaign instead.</p>

<p>Fast forward 20 years later and Talwar has renewed his research.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“After  a dormant period of 12 years, work on the anti-hCG vaccine was revived  at the insistence of the Indo-U.S. Committee on Contraception and Child  Health [sic],” he wrote last year. “We produced a recombinant vaccine  with the consideration that it will be amenable to large- scale  production by industry.”</p>

</div>
<p>The <a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-07-217.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Indo-US Program on Contraception and Reproductive Health Research</a> NIH  program, under the umbrella of the the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National  Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), has been  funneling millions into US and Indian research on contraceptives  including “immunocontraceptives.”</p>
<p>Anti-sperm vaccine researcher  Naz, for instance, has been funded by the NIH since 1991. Between 1999  and 2007, his take from NICHD averaged about a quarter of a million per  year. But that was augmented by grants from various local, state,  private, and federal agencies, including the West Virginia Clinical and  Translational Science Institute.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s all this background  information that has the Kenyan bishops in a knot today?  Actually, it  turns out the bishops were only acting on information given to them by  the Kenyan Catholic Doctors’ Association. The group’s president,  obstetrician/gynecologist Dr. Wahome Ngare, published a <a href="https://www.kenya-today.com/news/catholic-warning-neonatal-tetanus-vaccine-wto-deadly-bad-women-reproductivity" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">letter</a> in  the Kenyan press on Tuesday.  In this letter, Dr. Ngare says his group  first grew suspicious of the WHO/UNICEF sponsored tetanus campaign that  began last October because of its irregular schedule of shots: normally  everyone can have them in infancy with boosters every three to five  years and pregnant women are eligible for two additional shots at least a  month apart.  Instead, all women and girls were to have three doses of  the vaccine (possibly five) at six-month intervals.</p>
<p>What’s more,  Ngare said that when they realized the tetanus vaccines being used in  this campaign were “imported into the country specifically for this  purpose” and didn’t match batch numbers for regular vaccines, they  obtained vials of the tetanus vaccines in March 2014 and subjected them  to testing and found them “laced with HCG.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“This  proved right our worst fears,” Dr. Ngare wrote, “that this WHO/UNICEF  campaign is not about eradicating neonatal tetanus, but is a  well-coordinated, forceful, population control, mass sterilization  exercise using a proven fertility regulating vaccine.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But  that would mean that somewhere, in that vast labyrinth of Gates and  Rockefeller-funded alliances of world banks and health organizations,  academic institutions, pharmaceutical giants and government ministries,  civil society organizations, NGOs and population councils, someone has  intentionally kept secret experimental contraceptives in a medicine,  pretending to save innocent babies, while hand-wringing about them  damaging the planet. Creepy, but not so unbelievable for some who’ve  seen it before.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The mainstream media finds it hard  to believe that anyone would deliberately inoculate a woman against  pregnancy without her foreknowledge or consent,” says Steven Mosher,  president of the Population Research Institute who was the first social  scientist to witness China’s One Child Policy in action and to tell the  world about the forced abortions he saw first hand. “But as someone who  has followed abusive population control programs now for 30 years, and  seen repeatedly how such programs violate the fundamental rights of  women, I am no longer surprised. It has happened before. It will happen  again.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/vaccineexempt.html" rel="nofollow" style="float: right;margin-left: 1em;margin-bottom: 0em"><img class="noshadow" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-ndvYUapEn5A/TpHdZPRyqyI/AAAAAAAALS0/rUkfbJmy3o0/s240/vaccinexempt2.jpg" style="background:none" alt=""></a>Maybe that’s how the Kenyan bishops see it.   After all, part of their job is concerned with the darker aspects of  human nature.  Maybe, as Dr. Ngare said, they are only doing their civic  and moral duty with the information they have.</p>
<p>In the meantime,  Kenyan health ministry officials have decided to put an end to any  further conspiracy talk, at least among the professionals.  According to  a <a href="http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/health/article/2000140459/health-officials-want-to-punish-doctor-in-tetanus-vaccine-dispute" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Standard Media report</a> this  week, Kenyan Health Cabinet Secretary James Macharia and the Director  of Medical Services Nicholas Muraguri, have decided to “punish”  obstetrician/gynecologist Stephen Karanja, for approaching the Kenyan  bishops and sounding the alarm about the vaccine.</p>
<p>Dr. Karanja has  been summoned to the Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Board for  disciplinary action.  “It is clear that he was wrong, and we now have  to take action. It is very unethical,” said Muraguri.</p>
<p>Action  indeed.  Just the sort of decisive action Bill and Melinda Gates and  their allies in the World Health Organization and the pharmaceutical  industry are certain to approve of. And for Kenya’s 2.3 million women  and girls, and millions more across the world, the not-so-controversial  tetanus vaccine campaign is certain to continue.<br />

<p>Amir Alwani, <i>Contributing Writer</i><br /><a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2011/10/reflections-on-our-epic-struggle.html"><b>Activist Post</b></a></p>
<p>The chaos we see in our world today is largely symptomatic of a recipe for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EB3Wycz3F-w" target="_blank" title="researcher Alan Watt elaborates" rel="noopener noreferrer">world domination and the creation of a world government</a>  ruled by un-elected technocratic elites. Central to an understanding of  the political climate we are (and have been) in is the classic <i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29C_KNZ7RNs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Problem, Reaction, Solution</a></i> scenario whereby governments create a <i>problem </i> behind the scenes, then pose as saviors for that engineered problem upon getting our <i>reaction </i>of panic and desperation. They then offer a deliberately defective <i>solution</i>, just in the nick of time.  Many of you know this, but it’s worth repeating.</p>
<p>This is quite the trick, but fortunately today’s science is reminding  us that there is no separation between us and anything else. That is the  spirit behind operations like <a href="http://www.wearechange.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">We Are Change</a> and the idea that “<a href="http://www.infowars.com/dc-news-station-covers-%25E2%2580%259Cv-for-victory%25E2%2580%259D-campaign/" target="_blank" title="DC News Station Covers “V For Victory” Campaign" rel="noopener noreferrer">Resistance Is Victory</a>“. We have been lulled by theatricals. Alex Jones says the elites’ domination over us is like an “ant whipping a buffalo”. It <i>is </i>a  joke and, by the way, it’s worth remembering that a good book always  involves some conflict. In our collective story, conflict will bring out  the best in people. I can already see and feel it bringing out the best  in me and those close to me.</p>
<p>We must not let the turbulence of these  times get to us.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><b>Depopulation Agenda</b></p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/unexplainable.html" style="clear: left;float: left;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-right: 1em" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_qLAIskTQXUc/TdShMb4n6MI/AAAAAAAAI3o/d72a9NrD4wE/unexmys.gif"></a>People act as though it’s no question that serial killers exist.  But those same everyday people cannot, for some reason, grasp the  possibility that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyK3o-fl27k" target="_blank" title="The Elite's Plan for Global Extermination Exposed by Dr. Webster Tarpley" rel="noopener noreferrer">serial killers might somehow <i>network</i></a> or form any type of <i>alliance </i>where  they pool their resources together to help them kill more people in  more efficient ways.</p>
<p>People act as though it’s no question that hit-men  exist, but they can’t grasp the possibility that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvAL5w9JCPQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">economic hit-men</a>  exist, or that gigantic institutions like the UN seriously want to  depopulate the Earth by 85%. Some people are delusional and think that  they’ll be one of the lucky 15%, but they would be well advised to visit  websites like <a href="http://www.overpopulationisamyth.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">overpopulationisamyth.com</a>.  Not all serial killers are put behind bars. If all the serial killers  were actually put behind bars we wouldn’t have genocidal lunatics in as  many prominent positions of power all over the globe all throughout  history. Engineering a global financial crisis is quite a high crime and  has the intended consequence of killing many people. I would imagine  this financial collapse would be a lot easier to deal with if a lot of  us lived on farms as most did during the during the Great Depression. Many of  us live in cities now. The situation is ripe for chaos.</p>
<p><b>Are They Really That Powerful?</b></p>
<p>Tough times are ahead of us, but, as we know, strife builds character.  We should take this as a challenge. If you’ve ever known a stubborn  person then you know it takes some kind of traumatic event to get that  person to look in the mirror. Nerve-wracking situations <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?&amp;v=5M_mP6EtfAw" target="_blank" title="IMF advisor says we face a Worldwide Banking Meltdown 2-3 Weeks" rel="noopener noreferrer">are coming</a>, and by many definitions are <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2017818/Embryos-involving-genes-animals-mixed-humans-produced-secretively-past-years.html" target="_blank" title="150 human-animal hybrids grown in labs..." rel="noopener noreferrer">already upon us</a>. Life on Earth is indeed threatened by the breakaway civilization’s mad efforts with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?&amp;v=kCFP_Unf6zA" target="_blank" title="Genetic Armageddon: Humanity's Greatest Threat" rel="noopener noreferrer">GMOs</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?&amp;v=XTcfMvfNhJc" target="_blank" title="G. Edward Griffin &amp; Michael J. Murphy: What in The World are They Spraying - Alex Jones Tv 1/4" rel="noopener noreferrer">chemtrails, </a>but  there is a possibility that we have overestimated just how dominated we  are by these people, despite our degenerating society and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeU6I2qOY3k" target="_blank" title="Lindsay Lohan Poisoned! Along with 300 Million Other Americans" rel="noopener noreferrer">mass drugging</a>, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOStoGd5GZw" target="_blank" title="Mancow Gets Waterboarded: Admits It’s Torture" rel="noopener noreferrer">torture</a>, wars, etc. There is the possibility that we have much more potential than we previously thought.</p>
<p>They want to get in our faces? Well then let them play their con  game. Let the corporate oligarchy finally show its true colours. After  all, our standard of living has been so eradicated that we have almost  nothing left to lose. Not all of us have had the luxury of basking in a  trance the past 10 years. Many of us could have acted earlier, but  “better late than never” is a common saying. We have prayed, we have sat  by and watched this dark system devour almost every last drop of  wealth, energy, creativity, freedom and hope. We are starving. We have  no financial future. Many of us miss the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?&amp;v=U1m_aK8KEvo" target="_blank" title="Chem/contrail Timelapse - 73 Planes Before Breakfast" rel="noopener noreferrer">sunlight</a>.  We’re sick of watching each other slowly die physically, spiritually  and mentally. Many of us have woken up to how controlled our lives have  been from the very beginning and silencing us will not be easy.</p>
<p>Our global dictators, on the other hand, have everything left to lose. I mean what <i>they </i>call  “everything”. They see the world in only in terms of survival and  profit. Money and power is the name of their game. This agenda for a  world government has been in place for over a hundred years. Beauty  doesn’t do much for these people, so they’ve unleashed an impressive  arsenal of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaMOyKbOZI" target="_blank" title="Alex Breaks Down Soft Kill Weapons 1/3" rel="noopener noreferrer">soft kill weapons</a> on us. If they quit now, their lives will seem to have been a waste. We are <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/18-signs-that-life-in-u-s-public-schools-is-now-essentially-equivalent-to-life-in-u-s-prisons" target="_blank" title="18 Signs That Life In U.S. Public Schools Is Now Essentially Equivalent To Life In U.S. Prisons" rel="noopener noreferrer">ruled </a>by  psychopathic control freaks who’s astronomical lust for destruction and  deception is only rivaled by their fear of competition. Fortunately, we  are evolving. We are learning to cooperate.</p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>It’s been said that we are now collectively at an infant stage of  evolution. We need to grow up. We shouldn’t beat ourselves up about our  conundrum. Yes, our history is full of suffering, but let’s examine <i>channeling </i>for  a moment. Daryl Anka channels an ET who goes by the name Bashar.  Humanity keeps falling back into tyranny, time and time again, but if  Daryl Anka’s Bashar is correct then our world is preparing to experience  a level of unprecedented unconditional love, in the near future. When  we remember <i>who we really are</i>, when we reclaim our connection to spirit and regenerate <i>love </i> (this one last time), then that love will <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfgsAzRCQ6o" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">never be lost again</a>.</p>

<p>We are on the brink of a gigantic evolution. We have repeatedly  watched our world get raped and pillaged by royalty, governments,  corporations and each other. We have endured lifelong campaigns of  propaganda and advertising, but the truth is more popular than ever.  People are seeing that the <a href="http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/internet-hits-all-time-high-news-source-tv-all-time-low-says-pew" target="_blank" title="Internet Hits All-Time High as News Source, TV at All-Time Low, Says Pew" rel="noopener noreferrer">mainstream media</a>  are a pack of liars. As counterculture icon Terrence McKenna noted, we  have been born into a culture that we have no say in, but are  nevertheless expected to pass on this sick culture to our offspring.  It’s clear that there is an overwhelming pressure to conform and that  rewards are passed along to the main enforcers of authority. The status  quo is instilled through blackmail and a parade of toys, but there <i>is</i>  light at the end of the tunnel. We should expect change, but only if we  make sacrifices and invest time. We shouldn’t expect it to be easy, or  handed down to us, but we can look forward to it being rewarding  afterward.</p>
<p><b>We Live In Fascinating Times</b></p>
<p>Time feels like it’s moving by much faster these days. Everybody  feels it. I feel it. I know you feel it. Gregg Braden feels it and he  says that scientists have found a way to measure the <i>heartbeat </i>of  the Earth. That heartbeat is accelerating. This is happening as the Earth’s magnetic field is getting weaker and weaker. Scientists looking  at the fossil record have pondered that <a href="http://www.martinfrost.ws/htmlfiles/aug2006/cosmic_rays1.html" target="_blank" title="New evidence that cosmic rays altered human evolution" rel="noopener noreferrer">cosmic rays</a>  may be responsible for the jumps in evolution seen occurring  simultaneously in many different plants and animals in the past. Those  who talk of the Mayan calendar mention that our solar system’s alignment  with the center of the galaxy is due soon. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?&amp;v=a4e_wlLb_kk" target="_blank" title="Crop Circles: Quest for Truth" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crop circles</a> may be <a href="http://consciouslifenews.com/david-wilcock-discusses-crop-circles-energy-vortex/111562/" target="_blank" title="David Wilcock Says Crop Circles Predict DNA Changes" rel="noopener noreferrer">predicting upcoming abrupt changes in our DNA</a>.</p>

<b>The Holographic Universe</b></p>
<p>We are the white blood cells warning others in an effort to ramp up  teamwork to expel the toxin, the parasitic system that enslaves us. We  are one part of a larger whole.</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both;text-align: center"><a href="https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/neuron-galaxies1.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em;margin-right: 1em"><img border="0" height="250" src="https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/neuron-galaxies.jpg" width="400"></a></div>
<p>
This brings me to Michael Talbot who discusses the holographic model  of the universe, something which sounds complicated, but isn’t, and  which ultimately illustrates the interconnected nature of all things and  challenges the limiting assumptions that have so crystallized into us.  His book, <i>The Holographic Universe</i>, was published in 1991, but for most  people it probably reads like it was published yesterday. This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBCFA50E51405E282" target="_blank" title="Michael Talbot on Holographic Universe" rel="noopener noreferrer">lecture </a>is seminal (http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBCFA50E51405E282) but the following video is more condensed:</p>
<p>The whole is contained in every individual part of the whole (as in  fractal geometry). As a result, for instance, skilled acupuncturists can  look at your ear and can predict things like whether or not you need  immediate open heart surgery. That’s right <i> – just from looking at your ear. </i>This  is because there are different places on the ear that correlate to  places on your body. The way the points are mapped out, it makes the ear  look like a fetus.</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both;text-align: center"><a href="https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/earms1.gif" style="margin-left: 1em;margin-right: 1em"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/earms.gif" width="306"></a></div>
<p>People also read palms. <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/031760_iridology_health.html" target="_blank" title="Take a closer look at iridology" rel="noopener noreferrer">Iridology </a>is a similar reading of the iris.</p>
<p>People look deep into your eyes for clues, deep into your ears, and  deep into your hands. Obviously, since everything is so interconnected,  if we want to learn about our present and future then we must deeply  look at our distant past.<b> </b></p>
<p><b>Cell Wisdom</b></p>
<p>In a fascinating Red Ice Radio interview, physicist Tom Campbell  touches upon a number of things, one being how the first cells that  existed on Earth had to cooperate and get together because they found  that was more effective than competition. For him, we are here to “lower  our entropy” and to “become love”. He explains that as we grow up and  lower our consciousness’s entropy, the whole system grows up because we  are a part of that system. He elaborates with in-depth analysis in this  intriguing video:</p>

In this next video below, cellular biologist Bruce Lipton talks of  how the “brain” of the cell is not its DNA. Instead, the surface of the  cell’s skin is the brain (DNA is more like the gonads). The surface of  the skin of the cell is where all the action is, so to speak. Thus,  cells grew larger to be able to do more things but, naturally, like a  balloon, they pop/die if they get too big. Bruce Lipton understood that  ending their competition was a huge part of how some cells were able to  survive and thrive. First there were single cells, then groups of cells,  then cells specializing in different organs, leading all the way up to  the present moment where we find ourselves raping, stabbing and bombing  each other, oblivious that the history of the very cells that compose us  reveals lessons of cooperation. We are <i>made </i>of cells whose  survival depended (and still depends) on cooperation. One might say we  can break free from our mental jail cells, in a sense, by learning about  the cells in our body. Bruce Lipton elaborates on his findings and the  spiritual/political implications here:</p>

<p><b>Gregg Braden’s God Code</b></p>
<p>Also in the realm of cells, Gregg Braden’s profound research has  shown that the DNA of every living being on earth has the message “GOD  ETERNAL WITHIN THE BODY” encoded in it. Watch him expand on that in this  video:</p>

<b>Effects Of Our Amnesia</b></p>
<p>Bruce Lipton has written that his peers in med-school didn’t much  care to take quantum physics. I think that’s a shame because quantum  physics is shedding light on consciousness, and is scientifically validating  ancient wisdom. I think our world could stand to be a little more  conscious these days, especially when we have ignorant dentists pushing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?&amp;v=rL83S3zL0OE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fluoride</a>. Effective alternative medicine is <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/031976_North_Carolina_health_freedom.html" target="_blank" title="North Carolina SB 31 bill seeks to turn healers into felons; but the health freedom backlash has already begun" rel="noopener noreferrer">demonized</a>. Ignorant cops are enforcing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?&amp;v=gi1dgQ9TQ4M" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">unjust food laws</a> of all kinds. There is mass drugging/vaccination of populations at the behest of the GMO and pharmaceutical industry. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?&amp;v=pP-XEpAAtl8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The list goes on</a>. Some may be surprised to learn that in the ’70s, Kissinger called for <a href="http://www.schillerinstitute.org/food_for_peace/kiss_nssm_jb_1995.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">using food as a weapon</a>.</p>

Here, we  expose who’s giving the IoM money and why the actual sources of funding  behind the IoM destroy any credibility it once claimed to have on the  subject of public health.</p>

<p>As we fall further into tyranny, those who have not woken up are  going to continue with obsolete ways of life. They will become more and  more delusional, à la Titanic Syndrome. Others who have figured out what  works are going to fight for their rights.</p>
<p>In 2008, Russian political analyst <a href="https://arthurzbygniew.blogspot.com/2008/11/senior-russian-diplomat-usa-will.html" target="_blank" title="Russian analyst predicts decline and breakup of U.S." rel="noopener noreferrer">Igor Panarin</a> predicted the U.S. would collapse by 2010.

<p><b>Birth Isn’t Easy</b></p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both;text-align: center"><a href="https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/ahead1.jpg" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img border="0" height="192" src="https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/ahead.jpg" width="200"></a></div>
<p>Things might get ugly, but one analogy I’ve always liked is the  following. According to McKenna, if you were, say, a neanderthal and had  never witnessed a woman giving birth before and you witnessed a birth  happening for the first time, you might conclude that something horrible  is happening as you hear agony and see blood. It would take you a while  to say “at last, new life”. If you were able to tell the baby at that  moment in time, that despite the excruciating pain he’s feeling while  going through that canal he will nevertheless, in 25 years, be playing  jazz and relaxing, basking in the sun, networking — that baby might  think you were a liar. We are going through similar times now. The Earth  seems to be our womb.</p>
<p><b>Grassroots Opposition</b></p>
<p>Inevitably, we are at a historical crossroads that is demanding much  from us. The very fabric of life on Earth is threatened and our models  are outdated, but there is room for hope and justification for remaining  positive. It’s easier to think there’s nothing we can do about it, but I  won’t lick boots.</p>
<p>In Halifax, even a year ago, I saw <a href="http://infowars.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">infowars.com</a> stickers <i>everywhere </i>(bus  shelters, garbage cans, mailboxes, etc). Sometimes somebody took them  down, but usually fresh ones would be right back up there soon after. I  also know 2 tattoo artists who “force-feed” their clients Alex Jones  documentaries during the tattooing. There are passionate people around  here who have stopped being passive observers and have creatively  inspired with active participation. We might not see them often, but  they are there.</p>
<p>The globalists are almost out of tricks. All they have is false flag  terrorism and war. How long can that kind of thing last? Scientists have  <a href="http://news.rpi.edu/update.do?artcenterkey=2902" target="_blank" title="Minority Rules: Scientists Discover Tipping Point for the Spread of Ideas" rel="noopener noreferrer">found </a>that  after an idea reaches 10% of the population it spreads like wildfire.  Researchers have also discovered a ratio of how many people need to be  praying/meditating to affect 7 billion people. They found that <a href="http://hinduism.about.com/cs/meditationyoga/a/aa110403a.htm" target="_blank" title="Group Meditation Reduces Terrorism" rel="noopener noreferrer">7,000 people could affect 7 billion</a>.  This is the science of what works. We have learned from our experiences,  and free humanity is a force to be reckoned with.</p>
<p>Ancient wisdom will  prevail.</p>
<p>We insist on justice. In particular, we really don’t like the <i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UqcY8lGUUE" target="_blank" title="Head of Security at San Antonio Fed Admits Institution is Private!" rel="noopener noreferrer">corporation </a></i>known as the <b>Federal Reserve</b>. You can’t make 95% of the value of the U.S. dollar evaporate in just a few decades without a significant amount of people <a href="http://www.wearechange.org/?p=10025" target="_blank" title="WeAreChangeOklahoma – Occupy The FED!" rel="noopener noreferrer">knowing </a>and  igniting a big chunk of grassroots opposition. Some ideas you just  can’t hijack. The globalists know this and have prepared. It’s not new  information to them, but it’s new to many of us so we have the  responsibility to refine our understanding of this power structure.</p>
<p>We  have the responsibility to spread the word so that we can more effectively  demand that the true source of the problem be dealt with. We have no  more patience for anything else. We will not cut corners in our pursuit  of truth. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hbUMmaPnN8" target="_blank" title="Exposing The Fed is Key: Danny Panzella Reports" rel="noopener noreferrer">Federal Reserve</a>  system and 9/11 is at the heart of societal degradation. These are two  things everybody should investigate. Don’t wait for experts. They won’t  come to you. As acclaimed hip-hop artist <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWh077_Ed3w" target="_blank" title="Immortal Technique- The Cause of Death" rel="noopener noreferrer">Immortal Technique</a>  proposes in his lyrics, “Read it yourself instead of asking the  government why”. </p>

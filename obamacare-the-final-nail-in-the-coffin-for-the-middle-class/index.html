<p>If there were any shreds of hope left that the stunning decline of  the middle class could be turned around, Obamacare has absolutely  destroyed them. Over the past decade or so, the middle class in the  United States has been <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/which-america-do-you-live-in-21-hard-to-believe-facts-about-wealthy-america-and-poor-america" title="absolutely eviscerated">absolutely eviscerated</a>.  The number of working age Americans without a job has increased <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/10-facts-about-the-growing-unemployment-crisis-in-america-that-will-blow-your-mind" title="by 27 million">by 27 million</a> since the year 2000, median household income in the U.S. has fallen <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/median-household-income-has-fallen-for-five-years-in-a-row" title="for five years in a row">for five years in a row</a>, and the poverty numbers in this country are <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/29-incredible-facts-which-prove-that-poverty-in-america-is-absolutely-exploding" title="spiraling out of control">spiraling out of control</a>.   And now here comes Obamacare.</p>
<p>As you will see below, Obamacare is  causing millions of Americans to lose their current health insurance  policies, it is causing health insurance premiums to explode to  absolutely ridiculous levels, and it is systematically killing jobs even  though the employer mandate has been delayed for a while.  All of this  is creating a tremendous amount of stress for millions of middle class  families that are already stretched extremely thin financially.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>According to <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2013/06/24/pf/emergency-savings/" target="_blank" title="CNN">CNN</a>,  a survey that was conducted earlier this year found that 76 percent of  all Americans are living paycheck to paycheck. Most of those families  simply cannot afford to pay much higher health insurance premiums for  new policies that also come with much larger deductibles and  significantly increased out-of-pocket costs.  Millions of those families  will ultimately end up choosing to do without health insurance  altogether, and that will create a whole host of new problems.  This is a  disaster that is so enormous that it is really hard to put into words. If the U.S. health care system was a separate country, it would be the  6th largest economy on the entire globe all by itself.  And now  Obamacare is going to bring the entire U.S. health care system to its  knees.</p>
<p><b>Obamacare: Since October 1st, The Number Of Americans With Health Insurance Has Fallen By Nearly 4 Million</b></p>
<p>Last week, Barack Obama decided to allow Americans to keep their current health insurance plans for one more year.</p>
<p>Isn’t that generous of him?  Especially considering the fact that he promised us <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpa-5JdCnmo" target="_blank" title="over and over">over and over</a> that if we liked our current health insurance policies that we would be able to keep them permanently.</p>
<div align="center">
<ins class="adsbygoogle" style="height: 60px;width: 468px"></ins></p>
<p>    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || ).push({});
</p></div>
<p>
The funny thing is that Obama is not actually changing the law.  So  if your health insurance company allows you to stay on your current  health insurance plan that does not meet the requirements of Obamacare, <i>it is technically breaking the law</i>.</p>
<p>And if you continue to stay on that current health insurance plan that does not meet the requirements of Obamacare, <i>you are technically breaking the law</i>.</p>
<p>It is just that Obama has promised not to enforce what the law says for one year.</p>
<p>For a president to just blatantly disregard the rule of law is a very  dangerous precedent.  Do we really want the president to have the power  to decide what laws are going to be enforced and what laws are not  going to be enforced?</p>
<p>That sounds dangerously close to a dictatorship to me.</p>
<p>And in any event, there are many Americans that are not going to be  able to keep their current policies no matter what Obama says.  For  example, just two hours after Obama announced his plan last week, <a href="http://blogs.seattletimes.com/healthcarecheckup/2013/11/14/state-insurance-commissioner-rejects-obamas-proposal-to-extend-canceled-policies/" target="_blank" title="the state of Washington">the state of Washington</a>  announced that they would not be allowing insurance companies to extend  their old health insurance plans if they don’t comply with Obamacare  under any circumstances…</p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<blockquote>
<p>State Insurance Commissioner Mike Kreidler has rejected  President Obama’s proposal to allow insurance companies to extend health  insurance policies for people who have received notices that their  policies will be cancelled at the end of the year. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Within two hours of President Obama’s news conference announcing the  proposed administrative fix for Americans upset by their policy  cancellations, Kreidler issued a statement rejecting the proposal. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/backyardliberty.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em;margin-right:-3em"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ONE8Lk_RzR8/UjeZnRyZRTI/AAAAAAAAVJw/TMNS4NzHKZo/s220/BL_158220.gif" alt=""></a>“I understand that many people are upset by the notices they have  recently received from their health plans and they may not need the new  benefits [in the Affordable Care Act] today,” he said. “But I have  serious concerns about how President Obama’s proposal would be  implemented and more significantly, its potential impact on the overall  stability of our health insurance market.” </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“I do not believe his proposal is a good deal for the state of  Washington,” Kreidler’s statement continued. “We will not be allowing  insurance companies to extend their policies.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How do you think the people of the state of Washington will respond to that?</p>
<p>Things are getting crazy out there, and the number of people that are  losing their health insurance policies is absolutely stunning.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303789604579197733759439274?mod=WSJ_WSJ_US_News_4" target="_blank" title="the Wall Street Journal">the Wall Street Journal</a>,  so far 106,185 Americans have enrolled in Obamacare since October 1st.   Most of those that have successfully enrolled have done so through the  state insurance exchanges.  So far, only 26,794 Americans have signed up  for health insurance using the federally run exchanges on  HealthCare.gov.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, during that same time frame, 4.02 million Americans have had their health insurance policies cancelled.</p>
<p>So that means that the number of Americans with health insurance has actually decreased <b>by 3,918,205</b> since October 1st.</p>
<p>Wasn’t Obamacare supposed to result in more Americans being covered?</p>
<p>And according to <a href="http://sgtreport.com/2013/11/rand-paul-on-the-bogus-govt-shut-down-96-at-hud-93-at-epa-and-dept-of-eduction-90-unessential-and-one-guy-who-skipped-work-for-18-months-and-made-80000year/" target="_blank" title="U.S. Senator Rand Paul">U.S. Senator Rand Paul</a>, Obama not only knew that this would happen, he actually wrote the regulation that caused this to happen…</p>

<p>I’m still learning about it. It’s 20,000 pages of  regulations. The Bill was 2,000 pages and I didn’t realize this until  this week, the whole idea of you losing or getting your insurance  cancelled wasn’t in the original Obamacare. It was a regulation WRITTEN  BY PRESIDENT OBAMA, three months later. So we had a vote, this is before  I got up there. The Republicans had a vote to try to cancel that  regulation so you COULDN’T BE CANCELLED, to grandfather everybody in.  You know what the vote was? Straight party line. EVERY DEMOCRAT VOTED TO  KEEP THE RULE THAT CANCELS YOUR INSURANCE.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So now millions of Americans, including <a href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/woman-cancer-dropped-insurance-due-obamacare_767085.html" target="_blank" title="women battling cancer">women battling cancer</a>, are losing health insurance plans that they were depending upon.</p>
<p>Thanks Obama?</p>
<p><b>Obamacare: Skyrocketing Health Insurance Premiums</b></p>
<p>How much more are you willing to pay for health insurance than you are paying right now?</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/familysurvivalsystem.html" rel="nofollow" style="float: right;margin-left: 1em;margin-bottom: 0em"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-2dxSSyJSY-M/UnqDDNjqNaI/AAAAAAAAV7s/GmrEINt_kNM/s220/imgad.jpg" alt=""></a>10 percent?</p>
<p>20 percent?</p>
<p>30 percent?</p>
<p>Well, according <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2013/09/25/double-down-obamacare-will-increase-avg-individual-market-insurance-premiums-by-99-for-men-62-for-women/" target="_blank" title="to one study">to one study</a> health insurance premiums for men are going to go up by an average of <b>99 percent</b> under Obamacare and health insurance premiums for women are going to go up by an average of <b>62 percent</b> under Obamacare.</p>
<p>And of course some groups are going to see increases that are much  larger than that.  For example, it is being projected that health  insurance premiums for healthy 30-year-old men will rise by an average  of <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2013/11/healthcare-disaster-just-beginning/" target="_blank" title="260 percent">260 percent</a>.</p>
<p>Ouch.</p>
<p>And there are some families out there that have already been hit with  health insurance premium increases that are absolutely jaw-dropping.   In a <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/10-signs-that-obamacare-is-going-to-wreck-the-u-s-economy" title="previous article">previous article</a>, I included the example of <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/042703_Obamacare_rate_shock_health_insurance_costs.html" target="_blank" title="Mike Adams of Natural News">one family down in Texas</a> that has been hit with a 539% rate increase…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Obamacare is named the “Affordable Care Act,” after all,  and the President promised the rates would be “as low as a phone bill.”  But I just received a confirmed letter from a friend in Texas showing a <b>539% rate increase</b> on an existing policy that’s been in good standing for years. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As the letter reveals (see below), the cost for this couple’s policy under Humana is increasing from $212.10 per month to <b>$1,356.60 per month</b>. This is for a couple in good health whose combined income is less than $70K — a middle-class family, in other words.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Obamacare: Enormous Deductibles And Huge Out-Of-Pocket Expenses For All</b></p>
<p>It isn’t just health insurance premiums that are going up either.   Deductibles are going up too.  In fact, just check out what one survey  of Americans living in seven different states <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-15/obamacare-deductibles-26-higher-make-cheap-rates-a-risk.html" target="_blank" title="recently discovered">recently discovered</a>…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Expenses for some policies can reach $6,350 for a single  person and $12,700 per family, the most allowed by the health-care law,  according to a <a href="http://www.healthpocket.com/healthcare-research/infostat/obamacare-bronze-plan-study/#.UnculPmsiSo" rel="external" target="_blank" title="Open Web Site">survey</a>  by HealthPocket Inc. of seven states, including California and Ohio.  That’s 26 percent higher than the average deductible in the seven  states, and a scenario likely repeated across the country, said Kev  Coleman, head of research and data at Sunnyvale, California-based  HealthPocket.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That same article has a great quote from an elderly New Jersey  resident.  82-year-old Larry Saphire thinks that if you have to pay a  $5,000 deductible up front, “you might as well not have any insurance at  all”…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If you have to pay $5,000 upfront” when illness hits,  “you might as well not have any insurance at all,” said Larry Saphire,  82, of West Orange, New Jersey, who shopped for coverage for his wife  and two children, ages 16 and 21. “That’s not insurance.” </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>On California’s state-run exchange site, the standard low-premium  “bronze” plan carries a $5,000 deductible per person, a $60 co-pay to  see a doctor and a 30 percent fee, known as coinsurance, on hospital  care. In Rhode Island, Blue Cross Blue Shield’s bronze plan has a $5,800  deductible while Missouri’s U.S.-run exchange offers plans by Anthem  Blue Cross with the maximum-allowable $6,350 in out-of-pocket costs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Obamacare: The Quality Of Care Is Going To Go Into The Toilet</b></p>
<p>A lot of Americans that are signing up for Obamacare are going to be  in for a huge shock.  Many of the best hospitals and many of the best  doctors <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-11/hope-is-all-obamacare-has-left.html" target="_blank" title="are not covered by their plans">are not covered by their plans</a>…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, sometime between March and June, the other  shoe drops: People who bought exchange policies realize that the  restricted networks insurers created to keep the premium costs low cut  out the <a href="http://www.advisory.com/Daily-Briefing/2013/11/01/Many-Obamacare-exchange-plans-do-not-include-top-hospitals" rel="external" target="_blank" title="best hospitals">best hospitals</a>  and doctors. A newly insured child with cancer cannot get into a top  pediatric hospital because her insurance has zero coverage for  out-of-network emergency care. Tearful Mom goes on the evening news and  says that she thought when they went on Obamacare, that meant they were  safe, and why can’t I take my baby to Philadelphia Children’s Hospital,  Mr. President?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/backyardliberty.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-k0NQ-rOJPq0/UPDSF5crnFI/AAAAAAAATcw/i7Q6pBk-hoQ/s200/BL_013-200.gif"></a>Can you imagine being a parent in that situation?</p>
<p>In response, some hospitals are already filing suit over this.  For instance, check out what is happening <a href="http://www.storyleak.com/cant-keep-doctor-seattle-hospital-sues-obamacare-cuts-childrens-access/" target="_blank" title="over in Seattle">over in Seattle</a>…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Seattle Children’s Hospital filed suit against Washington  State’s Office of the Insurance Commissioner this week, after Obamacare  implementation caused the hospital to be cut from four of the six  insurance plans offered by the new Washington Health Benefit Exchange.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And even if you are on Medicare that does not mean that the quality of your care is going to stay the same either.  As <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/unitedhealth-drops-thousands-doctors-insurance-plans-wsj-030014903--finance.html" target="_blank" title="Reuters just reported">Reuters just reported</a>, UnitedHealth is dumping “thousands of doctors” from their Medicare Advantage plans for the elderly because of Obamacare…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>UnitedHealth Group dropped thousands of doctors from its  networks in recent weeks, leaving many elderly patients unsure whether  they need to switch plans to continue seeing their doctors, the Wall  Street Journal reported on Friday. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The insurer said in October that underfunding of Medicare Advantage  plans for the elderly could not be fully offset by the company’s other  healthcare business. The company also reported spending more healthcare  premiums on medical claims in the third quarter, due mainly to  government cuts to payments for Medicare Advantage services.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the United States, we already <a href="http://economy.money.cnn.com/2013/11/14/america-healthcare/?iid=HP_LN" target="_blank" title="pay much more">pay much more</a>  for health care than everyone else in the world, and we typically have  to wait longer to see a doctor than most of the rest of the  industrialized world does.</p>
<p>Now Obamacare is going to make all of this even worse, and the quality of the care that we receive is going to go downhill fast.</p>
<p><b>Obamacare: The Jobs Killer</b></p>
<p>A while back, Obama unilaterally made the decision to delay the implementation of the employer mandate until 2015.</p>
<p>That was probably a good political decision, because it would have been a huge political issue in the 2014 elections.</p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>But the truth is that we won’t have to wait until 2015 for Obamacare to start killing jobs.  In fact, according to <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/101196459" target="_blank" title="CNBC">CNBC</a> it is already happening…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Approximately one-third of business decision-makers at  companies with between 40 and 500 employees, say the health-care law has  already increased their costs due to hikes in both the cost of  insurance and compliance, according to a recent report from  political-research firm Public Opinion Strategies. As a result, many  business leaders say they are already making personnel decisions based  on the Affordable Care Act. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Among franchised businesses, 27 percent report their company has  replaced full-time workers with part-time workers and 31 percent have  reduced worker hours. Among non-franchised businesses, 12 percent are  replacing full-time workers with part-time workers or reducing hours.  This is happening now, with more than a year before the mandate goes  into effect; and undoubtedly, these numbers will rise as we approach  next July’s “look back” period for tabulating workers’ hours.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is kind of startling that we are already seeing employers make  such big changes even though the employer mandate does not come into  effect until 2015.  You can find a very long list of some of the  employers that have already either eliminated jobs or cut hours because  of Obamacare <a href="http://news.investors.com/politics-obamacare/101713-669013-obamacare-employer-mandate-a-list-of-cuts-to-work-hours-jobs.htm" target="_blank" title="right here">right here</a>.</p>
<p>Remember, this is just the tip of the iceberg.  Once we get closer to the deadline things are going to get much, much worse.</p>
<p>At a time when the middle class desperately needs jobs, Obamacare is going to slaughter them.</p>
<p>And even if you are able to keep your current job, that does not mean that your health plan will remain the same.  In fact, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2013/10/31/obama-officials-in-2010-93-million-americans-will-be-unable-to-keep-their-health-plans-under-obamacare/" target="_blank" title="Forbes">Forbes</a>  is projecting that a staggering 51 percent of all employment-based  health insurance plans will be canceled and replaced with new ones.</p>

<p>Overall, Forbes is projecting that an astounding <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2013/10/31/obama-officials-in-2010-93-million-americans-will-be-unable-to-keep-their-health-plans-under-obamacare/" target="_blank" title="93 million">93 million</a> Americans will eventually lose their current health insurance policies due to Obamacare.</p>
<p><b>Obamacare: Providing Huge Incentives For Many Americans To Work Less And Make Less Money</b></p>
<p>Did you know that Obamacare is going to cause millions of Americans to want to keep their incomes under certain levels?</p>
<p>If you make too much money under Obamacare, you will miss out on some  absolutely massive health care subsidies.  The following is an excerpt  from <a href="http://thetruthwins.com/archives/why-obamacare-will-motivate-millions-of-americans-to-make-less-money-and-get-divorced" target="_blank" title="one of my previous articles">one of my previous articles</a>…</p>
<div style="text-align: center">—–</div>
<div style="text-align: center">
</div>
<p>The figures that you are about to see were calculated using the <a href="http://kff.org/interactive/subsidy-calculator/" target="_blank" title="Kaiser Family Foundation subsidy calculator">Kaiser Family Foundation subsidy calculator</a>.  These numbers apply to a husband and a wife that are both 62 years old.</p>
<p>A non-smoking, married couple living in San Francisco, California  earning $63,000 a year will have to pay $20,318 a year for a silver plan  under Obamacare and $12,647 a year for a bronze plan.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/ultimatesurvivalplan.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-CTsdDqKcvhI/T7GjToaksaI/AAAAAAAAO2s/8vEb9HmqOhk/s316/160x316.gif" alt=""></a>At $63,000, that couple would be making too much money to be eligible  for a subsidy, so that couple will have to pay the total cost of  whatever plan they choose by themselves.</p>
<p>But if that couple only made $62,000 a year, things would dramatically change.</p>
<p>The plans would still cost the same, but the couple would now be eligible for an Obamacare subsidy of $14,428.</p>
<p>So a silver plan would end up costing them only $5,890, and they would ultimately pay <b>nothing</b> for a bronze plan.</p>
<p>In other words, by reducing their income by $1,000, that couple would  save $14,428 if they got a silver plan or they would save $12,647 if  they got a bronze plan.</p>
<p>Isn’t that bizarre?</p>
<div style="text-align: center">—–</div>
<p>
In the end, millions upon millions of middle class families will  decide to go without health insurance entirely for one reason or  another.</p>
<p>This will work great until they get into an accident or become seriously ill.</p>
<p>As I have discussed <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/50-signs-that-the-u-s-health-care-system-is-a-gigantic-money-making-scam-that-is-about-to-collapse" title="previous article">previously</a>, approximately <a href="http://articles.cnn.com/2009-06-05/health/bankruptcy.medical.bills_1_medical-bills-bankruptcies-health-insurance?_s=PM:HEALTH" target="_blank" title="60 percent">60 percent</a>  of all personal bankruptcies in the United States are related to  medical bills.  And most of those bankruptcies actually happen to people  that are supposedly “covered” by health insurance.</p>
<p>Obamacare is going to make all of this so much worse.  Millions of  middle class families will end up with no health insurance at all, and  because so many of them are living paycheck to paycheck a single health  emergency will be enough to send them hurtling down the path to  financial oblivion.</p>
<p>If you get into an accident, a visit to the emergency room and a  single night in the hospital can easily cost tens of thousands of  dollars in many areas of the country.</p>
<p>If you get a serious illness such as cancer, the medical bills can be  absolutely astronomical.  For instance, there are many cancer patients  that rack up medical bills well in excess of a million dollars by the  time that they die.</p>
<p>Something desperately needs to be done about our horrible health care  system.  Unfortunately, Obamacare is going to make just about  everything that is bad about our current system much, much worse.</p>
<p>And the American people are becoming increasingly disgusted and  frustrated with Obamacare.  According to Real Clear Politics, an average  of recent opinion polls shows that the American people are opposed to  Obamacare <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/obama_and_democrats_health_care_plan-1130.html" target="_blank" title="by an average margin of 14.2 percentage points">by an average margin of 14.2 percentage points</a>.</p>

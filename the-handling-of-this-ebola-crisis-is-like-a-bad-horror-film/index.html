<p><i>We hate to be the one to state the obvious (again), but how much more like a bad pandemic movie is this so-called “Ebola crisis” going to be allowed to get?</i></p>
<p>Yes. “Allowed.” The word was chosen carefully here. Why?</p>
<p>Let’s start back at in oh, let’s go with June, back when Ebola first  began murdering people in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. Somewhere  between 300 and 400 people had died, and the news was still fit for  little more than the ticker tape at the bottom of the screen on most  24/7 networks. Barely anyone was even paying attention. People shrugged  it off with little fanfare and the apathetic attitude of, “Well, that’s  just what happens in Africa sometimes…”</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>The death toll continued to rise. Ebola continued to openly spread.  No travel restrictions between borders were put in place. No air travel  bans were instituted. No nothing. Finally officials had to call it —  this Ebola outbreak was the deadliest in known human history. So what  did that change?</p>
<p>Not much. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the situation  was “totally out of control” and “one of the most challenging Ebola  outbreaks ever.” So challenging in fact, that they rushed to action by…<a href="http://truthstreammedia.com/deadliest-ebola-outbreak-ever-who-rushes-to-action-by-having-a-meeting/" target="_blank">calling a meeting</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, more people died. The virus continued to spread. The  healthcare system in these African nations was finally — not  surprisingly — overwhelmed. No one in the mainstream press bothered to  mention the fact that biowarfare researchers from Tulane University and  the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, Fort  Detrick had just so happened to have been over in the Ebola hot zone  countries, propagating cultures of different types of Ebola viruses (and  Marburg virus and Lassa virus and Dengue virus and West Nile virus and  yellow fever virus and chikungunya virus) in labs in the years leading  up to this outbreak.</p>

<p>Here’s one of the <a href="http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/20/7/13-1265_article" target="_blank">scholarly articles</a> published from that research just this past July in the CDC’s journal <i>Emerging Infectious Diseases</i>.</p>
<p>In it, the researchers conclude, “PRNT is the laboratory standard for  immunologic assays… In the ebolavirus PRNTs, we did not include the  newest discovered ebolavirus, Bundibugyo virus, which cross-reacts with  EBOV [Ebola virus] in immunoassays. Ebolavirus infections in Sierra  Leone might be the result of Bundibugyo virus or an ebolavirus genetic  variant and not EBOV.”</p>
<p>By the way, there are five types of Ebola virus and the newest strain  is named Bundibugyo, or Ebobun for short. The U.S. government actually  holds a patent on this strain — <a href="http://www.google.com/patents/US20120251502" target="_blank">US 20120251502 A1</a>, for “Human Ebola Virus Species and Compositions and Methods Thereof” related to the Bundibugyo version of the virus.</p>

<p>The research program, occurring in Sierra Leone, the  Republic of Guinea, and Liberia—said to be the epicenter of the 2014  Ebola outbreak—has the announced purpose, among others, of detecting the  future use of fever-viruses as bioweapons. Is this purely defensive research? Or as we have seen in the past, is  this research being covertly used to develop offensive bioweapons?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why do we have reports that the government of Sierra Leone has recently told Tulane researchers to stop this testing?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>Why</i> indeed.</p>
<p>Once Ebola got out of control enough that the doctors, nurses and aid  workers in those countries began dying of it regardless of all medical  precautions taken including bleach baths and full body protective gear,  two Americans were infected. So what did our government do?</p>
<p>The State Department spent an astounding $5 million and made a big  huge PR deal, with the lapdog establishment media in lock step, to  deploy a jet complete with a special Aeromedical Biological Containment  System that looked more like a bunch of plastic sandwich bags quilted  together with twisty ties to fly these people — a male doctor and a  female nurse — back to America for (experimental) treatment.</p>
<div style="text-align: center">
<a href="https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/aeromedbiocontainment.jpg"></a> </div>
<div style="text-align: center">The Aeromedical Biological Containment System.<br />
(CDC has sought and received the funds to keep this baby on retainer, just by the way.)</div>
<p>
These two Ebola-infected Americans were handled with what appeared to  be the utmost caution. Helicopter video from news outlets shows medical  teams decked out in full-body protective gear to bring these people  into the hospital for treatment…<i>except.</i></p>
<p>Except in the first instance, there was an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1sUICXty6J8" target="_blank">unprotected cameraman</a>  snapping away just a few feet from the infected doctor as he got out of  the ambulance to walk into the hospital. In the instance of the nurse,  the crew suited up to wheel her in on a gurney, and another guy in  protective gear stood watch on the sidewalk, seemingly to block if off  from the public, but take a look for yourself:</p>
<p>[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FV7eTaj9UwI?feature=player_embedded]</p>
<p>A completely unprotected man with a cell phone is just standing there  while they are wheeling this lady in and they don’t do anything about  it. They seemingly don’t even bother to tell him, “Hey buddy, you might  want to get off this sidewalk, we’re dressed like this for a reason and  that reason is we’re bringing in a patient infected with the highly  infectious, deadly Ebola virus. So ya know… You might want to go talk on  your cell phone somewhere else for a minute…just to be safe.” Instead  he’s right there and they do nothing.</p>
<p>By August, the governments of these African nations began declaring medical <a href="http://truthstreammedia.com/want-to-know-what-martial-law-over-ebola-will-look-like-check-out-whats-happening-right-now-in-africa/" target="_blank">martial law</a>  and the people there started just abandoning their dead in the streets  for fear they too would be dragged off to a treatment center as a  precaution where they might end up contracting Ebola if they didn’t  already have it. In fact, many Africans believe the Ebola outbreak is a <a href="http://www.thedailysheeple.com/so-the-people-of-sierra-leone-believe-the-ebola-outbreak-is-a-government-conspiracy-do-they_082014" target="_blank">government conspiracy</a>.  Which government? The United States, specifically the Department of  Defense. In fact, on September 9th, Dr. Cyril Broderick published an  article on the front page of Liberia’s Daily Observer titled, <a href="http://www.liberianobserver.com/security/ebola-aids-manufactured-western-pharmaceuticals-us-dod" target="_blank">“Ebola, AIDS Manufactured by Western Pharmaceuticals, US DoD?” subhead, “<i>Scientists Allege</i>“</a>.</p>
<p>Martial law declarations continued full force. Civil liberties were suspended. Soldiers in some places were instructed to <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Peace/2014/08/19/Liberia-Issues-Shoot-On-Sight-at-Sierra-Leone-Border-Missing-Ebola-Patients-Found" target="_blank">shoot people on sight</a>  if they tried to leave the Ebola hot zone. Homes were searched  door-to-door, and people were rounded up and forced into treatment  centers.</p>
<p>Fast forward to September, when rates of infection had increased to  the point that an average of five people are now infected with Ebola  every hour there. Now officials are estimating that some <a href="http://www.vtnews.vt.edu/articles/2014/09/092614-research-ebola.html" target="_blank">1.4 million people</a> could be infected by the end of January.</p>
<p>This is the level we’re at. And now, the U.S. government has done pretty much everything it can to <i>not</i>  stop Ebola from coming here (considering we’ve actually shipped it in  multiple times). In fact, it’s as if they did everything they could to  ensure it would get here at some point. Now, for the first time in the  history of the disease, an Ebola patient has been diagnosed here on  American soil in Dallas, Texas, the first nation in the world outside of  the continent of Africa to do so.</p>
<p>As our government continues to tell us to stay calm, and they have it  all “under control” just like in every Hollywood blockbuster where they  don’t have anything under control at all (<i>The Stand </i>or<i> Outbreak</i>, anyone?) complete with continued reassurances that the safety protocols are sound, <a href="http://www.thedailysheeple.com/ebola-patient-0-sick-guy-told-hospital-he-just-came-from-liberia-so-they-sent-him-home-for-2-days_102014" target="_blank">those protocols have already failed</a>  with Ebola Patient Zero Thomas Eric Duncan. The man went to the  hospital suffering Ebola symptoms and reported to the nurse he had just  come back from Liberia six days prior, so what did they do? They just  sent him home with some antibiotics, where he had contact for several  days with a bunch of people including five school children from four  different Dallas area schools <i>who continued to attend public school for at least two days afterward</i>. Public school: the place where germs and mucous membranes go on romantic dates.</p>
<p>Regrettably, they say it was all just a case of bad communication.</p>
<p>Now health officials have gone door-to-door in Dallas searching for  anyone who had contact with Ebola Patient Zero and forced these family  members into quarantine under a control order, after Duncan was rushed  back to the hospital in an ambulance, but not before vomiting on the  sidewalk outside his house. No official sanitation was done, but the  family is forced to stay there anyway, forced to give blood draws and be  on mandatory standby for any other medical tests and examinations  public health officials deem necessary <i>on demand</i> or <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/047104_Ebola_outbreak_quarantine_forced_blood_draws.html" target="_blank">they will face criminal charges</a>.</p>

Some <a href="http://rt.com/usa/192568-texas-ebola-patient-contact/" target="_blank">100 people</a> have likely come in contact with him at this point <i>at least</i>.  He left Liberia on September 19th and he went through Brussels and  Dulles Airport in D.C. before finally arriving in Dallas on the 20th.  Who actually remembers every person they came in physical or close  contact with in a week (the same week they are coming down with Ebola  and in serious condition)? Who can remember every time they coughed or  sneezed and where that cough or sneeze took place and around whom? They  claim the man wasn’t exhibiting any symptoms until two days before his  first trip to the hospital on September 26th, but no one can say for  sure what moment this man became truly infectious.</p>
<p>Two of Duncan’s <i>three</i> flights — that’s right, three — were on United Airlines, but the company says there is <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-ebola-airline-cabins-20141002-story.html" target="_blank">“zero risk of transmission”</a>  on their flights, regardless of the fact that A) that is simply an  impossible thing to state with absolute certainty, and thus, inherently  untrue, and B) the only thing there is zero of in regards to commercial  airplanes and Ebola transmission is the number of airline cabin cleaning  standards <i>which is zero</i>.</p>
<p>There are <a href="http://www.thedailysheeple.com/there-are-only-19-level-4-bio-containment-beds-in-the-whole-of-the-united-states-and-four-in-the-uk_102014" target="_blank">only 19</a> level 4 bio-containment beds in this country, but that’s okay, because the <a href="http://www.nih.gov/news/health/sep2014/od-27.htm" target="_blank">National Institutes of Health</a>  (NIH), an agency now proudly admitting their very own Ebola patient,  put out a press release claiming that Ebola patients can be safely  treated at any hospital with little risk as long as the CDC’s protocol  is followed (the same protocol that <i>already wasn’t followed </i>in Dallas<i>).</i></p>
<p>And about that vomit outside Duncan’s apartment? Here’s the <a href="http://twitchy.com/2014/10/02/news-chopper-caught-ebola-clean-up-crew-um-notice-anything-missing-its-enraging-photo/" target="_blank">cleaning crew</a> — wearing nothing more than jeans and a couple t-shirts — pressure washing it off the sidewalk and right down the storm drain:</p>

<p>Real “level 4″ stuff, right? Oh, and as of today, the same health  officials who had quarantined Duncan’s family in his apartment <i>still </i>had yet to sterilize it after he had been there for at least a week. Via <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/03/us/dallas-ebola-case-thomas-duncan-contacts.html" target="_blank">The New York Times</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the latest indication, state and local authorities  confirmed Thursday that a week after a Liberian man fell ill with Ebola  in Dallas, and four days after he was placed in isolation at a hospital  here, <b>the apartment where he was staying with four other people  had not been sanitized and the sheets and dirty towels he used while  sick remained in the home. County officials visited the apartment  without protection Wednesday night. </b>[emphasis added]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Without protection?” <i>Without protection</i>? In God’s name, <i>why? Why even take that chance?? </i></p>
<p>What in the hell going on here? So which is it? A $5 million  Aeromedical Biological Containment System jet and hazmats? Or will  t-shirts, ball caps, and a complete failure to do even a basic  disinfection job on the places that have been knowingly contaminated  with the virus suffice?</p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>Did we forget to mention that now a Dallas paramedic has come out to  say he drove the ambulance the Ebola patient was transported in without  anyone bothering to tell him it was used to transport an Ebola patient  (who at the time had not been officially diagnosed yet)? As <a href="http://www.shtfplan.com/headline-news/outrageous-dallas-paramedics-werent-told-they-were-driving-ebola-contaminated-ambulance-for-48-hours_10032014" target="_blank">Mac Slavo of SHTFplan</a>  wrote, “It is not known how many paramedics drove the ambulance during  the 48 hour period or how many patients were transported.”</p>
<p>…yeah.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/foodcrisis.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-AZzgc806w9s/TtEamGAkBbI/AAAAAAAAM2Y/GN5ff31ySP4/s200/imgad.jpg"></a>By definition, “Under control” is the last phrase anyone should call this situation.</p>
<p>In fact, this is every stupid horror movie on pandemic virus  outbreaks ever, compounded by an all new level of fail. When we watch  these films, many of us get frustrated at the sheer idiocy displayed by  the actors onscreen as things continue to get worse by the minute <i>because</i> of the casts’ own actions written into the script <i>to be stupid </i>and we as viewers declare that, “People would never be this dumb in real life,” and that’s why it’s a movie, right?</p>
<p><i>Wrong.</i> This is happening right here, right now and while  we’re all screaming at the people in charge to run out the front door as  the serial killer looms behind them (slow as it has been coming on all  these months), they’re apparently waving their arms and yelling “Come  and get me psychopath! I’m right here!” as they run in slow motion (more  like casually jog) up the stairs instead.</p>
<p>Don’t worry though; now the <a href="http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/opinion/58480880-82/story.csp" target="_blank">Council on Foreign Relations</a> is saying that Obamacare may hold the key to saving us Americans from Ebola. Yippee!</p>
<p>Oh, and the U.S. Department of State has issued an <a href="http://truthstreammedia.com/the-handling-of-this-ebola-crisis-is-like-a-bad-horror-film/truthstreammedia.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=9649&amp;action=edit" target="_blank"><i>alert</i></a>  about traveling to the Ebola-ravaged African countries. NOT A WARNING  mind you, an alert. Just to allow the agency to clarify that difference  for you, “We issue a Travel Warning when we want you to consider very  carefully whether you should go to a country at all.” (Something most of  us wouldn’t want to do if people are dropping dead in the streets from  Ebola and martial law has been declared, just by the way). For a mere  alert, however, they say, “We issue a Travel Alert for short-term events  we think you should know about when planning travel to a country. ”  That’s right. Ebola might outlast the war in Ukraine or even Syria, but  you don’t need to consider very carefully if you want to even go to  these Ebola-stricken, martial law controlled countries in Africa at all  right now…you just might want to “know about” the fact that OH BY THE  WAY, YOU COULD DIE FROM EBOLA IF YOU GO THERE RIGHT NOW.</p>

<p>Also, the government has no plans to cancel any flights from Guinea, Sierra Leone or Liberia according to the <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2014/10/02/white-house-no-plans-to-block-flights-from-ebola-countries/" target="_blank">White House press secretary</a>  (even though that’s how the first guy got here undetected) because,  well, that just makes too much sense. So, yeah. Be “alerted” and get  your tickets today. They’re probably even on sale.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the CDC keeps fidgeting on exactly how Ebola is  transmitted…mostly because they can’t say anything definitive with 100%  surety <i>and they know it.</i></p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/familysurvivalsystem.html" rel="nofollow" style="float: right;margin-left: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-FNX5buD7gFA/U2KovfyZRBI/AAAAAAAAAlk/oDTnmRV75Ng/s220/fsc-2.jpg" alt=""></a>First, the CDC removed the phrase <a href="http://truthstreammedia.com/cdc-removes-contaminated-air-from-its-new-ebola-webpage/" target="_blank">“contaminated air”</a>  from their Ebola information webpage on August 4th. Then on September  22nd, the CDC updated the agency’s question and answer page on Ebola  transmission to include a section on <a href="http://www.thedailysheeple.com/sneaky-cdc-changes-ebola-transmission-page-what-you-need-to-know_102014" target="_blank">what happens if an Ebola patient coughs or sneezes on you</a>  (not whether or not the person vomits, by the way. Coughing and  sneezing aren’t symptoms of Ebola, but vomiting is. All of these produce  bodily fluids which can transmit the disease). Prior, the agency held  steadfast to the idea that one absolutely has to have direct physical  contact in order to catch Ebola. They have now admitted this is not  true.</p>
<p>Now an <a href="http://boston.cbslocal.com/2014/10/03/nbc-news-cameraman-from-providence-diagnosed-with-ebola/" target="_blank">NBC Cameraman</a>  has caught the disease, and he was behind the camera wearing a bunch of  protective gear, just as many of the doctors and medical staff treating  the infected who later became infected themselves also wore protective  gear and took precautions. If it’s not airborne, how exactly are all  these people still getting infected?</p>
<p>Well…our health agencies aren’t <i>entirely</i> sure. First they  said it’s possibly bats, and they claim person-to-person it has to be  direct bodily contact…but it’s definitely not <i>airborne, </i>right? Nope. No way. They’ll never say it even if it is. And viruses never mutate (even as the <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2778022/UN-Ebola-chief-raises-nightmare-prospect-virus-mutate-airborne.html" target="_blank">United Nations</a>  has now declared that the longer this Ebola outbreak lasts, the more  chance the highly infectious, deadly virus has to mutate and become  airborne, something that would be globally devastating). Hey, if a  mosquito bites someone with Ebola, draws blood, then flies off to bite  someone else? Well, that question has yet to be answered too…</p>
<p>Still, when the CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden appeared on CNN recently  with Dr. Sanjay Gupta to discuss how the disease is transmitted,  Frieden failed to address the CDC’s new coughing and sneezing addendum,  and then actually managed to contradict himself in less than two minutes  live on air:</p>
<p>[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rpjTQUY3bw?feature=player_embedded]</p>
<p>You can tell by the big fat (creepy) smiles this was supposed to be a  cutesy, reassuring exchange for the masses, but it went bad pretty  quick. Here’s a partial transcript (the particular clip begins at  5:44ish in the video above, emphasis added below):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dr. Thomas Frieden, CDC director [standing right next to  CNN’s Sanjay Gupta]: Well actually, Sanjay and I, if one of us had  Ebola, the other would not be a contact right now. Because we’re not in  contact. Just talking to someone is not a way to get infected. It’s not  like the flu, not like the common cold. <b>It requires direct physical contact.</b> </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>CNN host Michaela Pereira: But if he sneezes on you, it’s a different story. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Sanjay Gupta: I think there’s a utility here because we’re having  this conversation but I am within 3 feet of you. Wouldn’t I be  considered a higher risk? My understanding reading your guidelines, sir,  is that within 3 feet or direct contact — if I were to shake your hand,  for example — would both qualify as being contact. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Frieden: We look at each situation individually and we assess it  based on how sick the individual is and what the nature of the contact  is. <b>And certainly if you’re within 3 feet, that’s a situation we’d want to be concerned about.</b>  But in this case, where we haven’t hugged — we haven’t shaken hands —  we have not had any contact that would allow either of our body fluids  to be in contact with the other person. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Gupta: So, to Michaela’s point, the reason we talk about coughing and  sneezing not being a concern — if you were to have coughed on me —  you’re saying that would not be of concern? </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Frieden: <b>We would look at that situation very closely…</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sure they would…<i>sure they would.</i></p>

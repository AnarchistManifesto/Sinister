<p>If you think the economy is simply going to collapse, think again. The bankers, the corporations, and the United Nations have got <i>ecosystem accounting</i> ready to rock and roll, and it’s set to change everything….</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>… the plan is brilliant.  You reduce the number from 7+ billion by at least 33% without firing one shot.  You simply privatize all natural resources and then price access so that the bottom third of the globe’s population cannot afford it.  And so, they die; it will be the biggest die-off of the Anthropocene epoch. From Papua New Guinea to Croatia, from Bolivia to Ghana, from Canada to Central America, from Scotland to Nigeria, from Australia to America, forests, water rights, mineral rights, arable land, national parks, and much more is being privatized with the usual outcomes: degradation, displacement of indigenous populations, higher costs, lack of access to necessary resources — starvation, death, social unrest and rebellion… (<a href="http://kulturcritic.wordpress.com/posts/avalanche-natural-capital-and-the-real-end-game/">‘Natural Capital and the Real End Game’</a>, Sandy Krolick)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There aren’t enough people talking about this. It casts a whole new light on the TPP, on the reasons for war, possible near-term changes to corporation tax, and economic failure in general, and boggles the mind when it comes to geoengineering. Whilst we can only speculate on these connections, one thing’s for sure – monocultures for biomass-products, GMOs, vaccines, pharmaceuticals, and nuclear energy will play a huge role, as they are now deemed to be renewable and/or socially responsible. </p>
<p><a name="more"></a>A circular economy which controls production and consumption is the ultimate aim, and this entails deep surveillance and prescriptive living for what will be called a <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2013/06/agenda-21-steady-state-illusion.html">steady-state system</a>. The system is being implemented by measuring the new capital assets, which are created by pricing people, nature. From these new <i>concepts</i>, alternative currencies are forming – we’ve already got carbon credits, and social credits, and the Club of Rome (and CoR member, Bernard Lietaer), for instance, have proposed Wellness Tokens. George Soros is one of the many New Economists who are promoting community currencies.</p>
<p>It’s time to open our eyes to all Agenda 21 entails: there’s a lot more to it than most activists think. The communitarian ideals of smart growth and sustainable development are but one part of a <i>much bigger movement </i>aiming for global ‘sustainability’ by privatizing the commons. This is achieved by measuring and pricing what are called ‘ecosystem services’, or the benefits accrued from the earth, and from people. It involves putting monetary values on aspects of nature, and the ‘services’ it provides (such as pollination), as well as pricing the productivity and overall conformity of <i>human beings</i> (see the U.N. plan to increase Global Happiness).</p>

World Bank and the OECD are just two of the globalists which have perfected the ways of pricing nature, and human well-being. The next step is for corporations and governments to incorporate these prices into their financial accounts, as mandated by <i>chapter 8 of Agenda 21</i>. This goes under various names; the term used for the masses is ‘going beyond GDP’, but more formally, the process is known as ‘integrated reporting’. Rather than just add up the usual profits and losses, they have to factor in new kinds of assets and liabilities, i.e. all the positive and negative effects the companies have, upon the earth, and upon people. </p>
<p>Apart from the usual built capital, i.e. goods and infrastructure, that normally make up the accounts of a company, and which are being restricted due to the fear of scarcity, four new types of <i>self-perpetuating</i> capital are now required to be priced, and accounted for. This new system of accountancy has been advanced for many years, and the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) has devised a framework which is to be implemented globally.</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>Specifically, there are five alternative forms of capital considered in the framework: manufactured capital accounts for machines the organisation uses to produce its goods or services; natural capital such as air, water and land; human capital covering not only people’s skills and experience, but also motivations or rewards to innovate; intellectual capital taking in the intangibles providing competitive advantage; and social capital – defined as the community stakeholders which “enhance individual and collective wellbeing”, which supports the business model. <a href="http://www.itbdigital.com/opinion/2013/06/14/capital-ideas-afloat-in-integrated-reporting/">(Source)</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The process of ecosystem accounting is generally made up of well-intentioned environmentalists, but led and paid for by <a href="http://www.wbcsd.org/about/members/members-list-region.aspx">trans-national corporations</a> (TNCs), including Monsanto, Syngenta, Novartis, BP, Shell, Alcoa, General Motors, and Coca-Cola. <a href="http://usbcsd.org/2005/11/27/members-and-colleagues/">(Source)</a></p>
<p>It’s unlikely that these corporations would be considered at all ‘sustainable’ by the environmentalists they are funding. Several corporations, such as Bayer, have also partnered with the U.N. to advance the protocol of Agenda 21. </p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/johnsonmotor.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-EvZXYW1UzmQ/TwILM4rxZ8I/AAAAAAAANv0/ASFoBpTJd1Q/s252/160x2.gif"></a>Since the inception of the protocol, at the Earth Summit in 1992, unsustainable businesses have been busy greening themselves. In the ’90s, corporate governance became the hot topic, leading to the promotion of ‘business ethics’, and seeding the idea that corporations ‘care’ about the consequences of their actions. Small changes were made to how companies were run, so that they could promote themselves as ‘doing the right thing’. All of the top companies now have a team who deal with the image of the firm in terms of its ‘corporate social responsibility’ (CSR). Although the focus has been on carbon-reduction, the social aspect has become increasingly hyped. Being ‘socially responsible’ is said to mean showing consideration for the well-being of all shareholders (i.e. the people you interact with, or all those affected by the operations of a business) and usually manifests as donating to social causes, or getting company employees to do volunteer work for a charity.</p>
<p>There has been a concurrent rise in social investment, such that philanthro-capitalism is now mainstream. The City of London Corporation promotes itself as conforming to the green and caring new world order in much the same way as the other major players:</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p><a href="http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/about-the-city/working-with-and-for-others/community/Documents/city-of-london-and-big-society.pdf">The City Corporation</a> has been active in the “Social Action” area for many years. We call this activity “Supporting Society”. We already have a proud record of promoting volunteering, environmental management, philanthropy and other forms of social responsibility such as local recruitment and responsible procurement to City businesses, workers, residents and our own staff.</p>

<p>Commenting on the rise of social investment, <a href="http://www.bigsocietycapital.com/sites/default/files/pdf/tax%20relief.pdf">Mark Boleat</a>, Policy Chairman at the City of London Corporation, noted there is now a “fast-increasing demand for risk and growth capital”, and recommends applying tax reliefs to social investment. Earlier this year, he said:</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>A recent report by the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) found that demand in the social investment market in England could reach £1bn by 2016, five times what it is today…… the demand for capital in the social sector could grow at a rate of 38% per annum.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since the Fortune 500 gave birth to, and raised, their corporate images to the new green standard, there have been many changes to company law around the world to enforce corporate ‘commitments’ to being carbon-neutral, and socially responsible. There has also been a huge increase in businesses which help both the public and the private sector to achieve these commitments, such that now the ‘sustainability industry’ is booming. Over the years, then, it has become ‘de rigour’ to try to be green.</p>
<p>The concept of ‘sustainable development’ has taken on many layers of meaning, and has become so normalised, that practitioners who use the term have never even heard of Agenda 21. Town planners laugh in the faces of opponents of the agenda, because they believe strongly in what they do. After all, the science is settled – most of the world has already been ‘delphied’, having been besieged with visioning by the media for many years. Think – ‘icecaps melting’ and ‘cute polar bears’. So most people accept the sustainability agenda without question, and need no further ‘nudging’. They are not conscious of steering the agenda themselves, nor of the consequences. </p>
<p>Take, for instance, Lisa Duncan, who is a “Chevron Environmental Specialist”, and has become a volunteer with United Way’s <a href="http://www.earnitkeepitsaveit.org/">Earn It! Keep It! Save It!</a> free tax preparation program. Lisa says, “The feeling around Chevron is that we live and work in the area and should be part of improving the community….I wanted to help people, and I wanted it to be interesting.” <a href="https://www.uwba.org/2013/03/chevron-taking-corporate-social-responsibility-to-heart/">(Source)</a></p>
<p>Another major mistake is to presume that anyone who says they care about the environment, and pays them to work to ‘save the world’ must be genuine. However, the sudden growth of ‘social giving’, and claims of ‘carbon-neutrality’, by the corporatocracy are <i>not </i>mirrored at the grassroots level. More to the point, those funding the eco-social technocratic smart world order are some of the most unsustainable/non-ecofriendly industries you could think of. Their keenness is so ripe, you can just smell their expectation of the profits they would reap.</p>
<p>So, if you’re going to say a word to anyone about Agenda 21, you’ve really got to tell them that, first and foremost, it’s about creating assets from nature and people. It is a system that will <i>increase </i>zoning and smart growth. The plan is so huge, so ambitious, and so nearly <i>ready </i>– and it encompasses EVERY vileness of the New World Order we deplore. </p>

They would be used to spy on people to ensure compliance with the new regime, e.g. gathering evidence of anyone damaging an asset, such as marring a pretty view in an eco-tourist hotspot, or walking on soil in a protected area.</p>
<p>Take smart meters – these will be but one mechanism to enforce allocation of individual energy allowances, in the steady-state system.</p>
<p>Take GMOs and vaccines – they are part of the caring façade of the NWO, as they are already being marketed as ‘socially and environmentally responsible’ – the NewSpeak rationale for global law.</p>
<p>Take national sovereignty, political ideology, the ability to choose where and who you want to be – all of these are subsumed by the New Economy, which is a global database of assets and liabilities, comprised of measurements of natural, built <i>and human</i> capital. </p>
<p>The right to give birth, access to water, food, clean air, a home, a gun, and possibly even the right to life – all will come under the laws associated with ownership of resources, and the aim of the communitarian steady-state system: R2P – to avoid running out, to protect what they say we have, and to always leave enough for future generations.</p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>I hope, for all our sakes, that people will wake up to this, and obstruct it. No one can confer the responsibility to do so, but it sure would be good.</p>
<p>Think about the wars being waged – it’s not just central banks and the expansion of development/extraction in the Third World that the elites want. They need EVERY country to abide by the new system, because it can only be said to work if ALL production, and ALL consumption, is tallied and priced, so that quantum computers can claim to run global simulations of the ups and downs of the bio-economy. The idea is that we have to balance consumption with production, on a global scale, to maintain an ecological and psychological equilibrium, using the steady-state economic paradigm. It involves collecting a huge amount of data, on all of us. It is also open to endless abuses from the manipulation of data and statistics, such as by re-defining what constitutes scarcity, abundance, value. For this, the system needs data from all parts of the world. Non-compliance would be deemed akin to eco-terrorism!</p>

<p><b>The number of power-brokers playing the game of Global Monopoly is being reduced.</b></p>
<p>The countries which are not yet following the laws of Agenda 21 need to be made to comply. Iran, Iraq, Russia, China, Egypt, Afghanistan, and Israel have already joined the sustainability-club. Now the elites need to convince North Korea and Syria, and more of the African nations, such as Somalia, to conform. Widespread bombing may no longer be the choice method of control, since this damages profitable natural capital assets. Cyber-war and targeted drone strikes are much cleaner, less damaging to the environment – and this is worth much MUCH more to them than the (unproductive) people they kill.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/organicfood.html" style="float: right;margin-left: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_qLAIskTQXUc/TSVu1WxuKgI/AAAAAAAAFpA/qvqvHS98iwY/150x120-set1.gif" alt=""></a>The earth is being sold off: incorporated. And so are we. Because part of the plan involves measuring our <i>happiness</i>, which they call well-being, and so the countries which have the fittest, strongest, well-fed, schooled and happy conformists will be the ones who secure higher measures of GDP. This plan to ‘go beyond GDP’ – measuring the worth of the earth, and the people – will lead to the commodification of these new assets, which will then be tradeable, just like carbon. Over time, they come to function as currencies.</p>
<p>A good starting point to try and wrap your head around some of the basic concepts is a child-friendly guide, published by <a href="http://peacechild.org/">Peace Child International</a>, the U.N.’s Youth Movement, called <a href="http://rioplus20education.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/book-one-an-introduction-to-SHD-interactive.pdf">‘Introduction to Sustainable Devleopment’</a>. It describes in simple terms the new economy being shaped by Agenda 21 (including Happiness Economics), and illustrates how lovely it all sounds. </p>
<p>Even <a href="http://www.globalpartnershipforoceans.org/key-issues/putting-economic-value-oceans">the oceans are being sold off</a> – or rather, the services they are deemed to provide, such as the profits gained from fishery, and ecotourism.</p>
<p>Besides the Green Economy, investment in the services provided by the oceans is growing. In February, this Blue Economy was given a boost by a new public-private partnership, launched with an <a href="http://www.businessgreen.com/bg/news/2155009/businesses-urged-dive-world-bank-s-usd15bn-global-partnership-oceans">investment of $1.5bn</a> by World Bank’s Global Partnership for Oceans at The Economist’s World Oceans Summit. The system requires a constant stream of data from sensors like <a href="http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Observing_the_Earth/Nature_valued_from_space">bioMEMS, and satellites</a>, such as the <a href="http://www.conservation.org/FMG/Articles/Pages/mapping_natures_benefits_ARIES.aspx">Artificial Intelligence for Ecosystem Services (ARIES) technology</a>. <a href="http://ariesonline.org/">(Source)</a></p>

<h3>Highland High School, California</h3>
<div class="ad gpt ad-h-1"></div>
<p>A 14-year-old student was taken into custody after <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/05/11/shooting-reported-at-california-high-school-sheriff-says.html" target="_blank">allegedly shooting a classmate</a> at Highland High School in Palmdale, California on May 11.</p>
<p>The suspected gunman, who has not yet been identified, shot a fellow student in the arm, police said. The shooting stemmed from a dispute between the shooter and the victim, according to authorities.</p>
<p>The injured student is expected to make a full recovery. </p>

<h3>Forest High School, Florida</h3>
<p>A suspected gunman, later identified as 19-year-old Sky Bouche, allegedly opened fire at Forest High School in Ocala, Florida, on April 20. The shooting occured on the 19th anniversary of the Columbine school shooting.</p>
<p>At least one student was injured after the gunman shot through a classroom door, hitting a 17-year-old student in the ankle, authorities said. The student was later taken to a local hospital with a non-life-threatening injury. </p>
<p>A school resource officer, James Long, <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/04/21/florida-school-resource-officer-hailed-hero-after-responding-quickly-to-shooting-that-injured-one-student.html" target="_blank">was hailed a hero</a> after arresting Bouche just three minutes after he opened fire. </p>
<p>Bouche, a former student at the school, allegedly carried the weapon in a guitar case inside the school, authorities said. </p>
<h3>Great Mills High School, Maryland</h3>
<p>On March 20, a gunman, identified as 17-year-old Austin Rollins, shot 16-year-old sophomore Jaelynn Willey <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/03/20/shooting-at-great-mills-high-school-in-maryland-school-confirms.html">at Great Mills High School</a> in Lexington Park, Maryland, authorities said. Willey died days later from her injuries.</p>
<p>Investigators believe the shooting was not random as the gunman and Willey had recently ended their relationship.</p>
<p>Rollins was fatally wounded during a confrontation with Deputy Blaine Gaskill, an armed school resource officer who doubles as a SWAT team member. </p>
<p>&#8220;Our school resource officer&#8230;pursued the shooter, engaged the shooter, fired a round at the shooter,&#8221; St. Mary&#8217;s County Sheriff Tim Cameron said. &#8220;The shooter fired a round as well. In the hours and days to come, we&#8217;ll be able to determine if our school resource officer&#8217;s round struck the shooter.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gaskill was praised because he reportedly contained the situation in under a minute, Cameron said. </p>
<p>Willey&#8217;s parents <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/03/23/maryland-school-shooting-victim-jaelynn-willey-16-has-died-police.html" target="_blank">announced on March 22</a> that their daughter was brain dead and that they would be taking her off of life support. She died later that night.</p>
<p>Jaelynn&#8217;s mother, Melissa, told reporters her daughter had &#8220;no life left in her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On Tuesday &#8230; our lives changed completely and totally forever. My daughter was hurt by a boy who shot her in the head and took everything from our lives,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>A 14-year-old boy, later identified as Desmond Barnes, was also injured in the shooting. Authorities said he was shot in the thigh but was later released from a local hospital. </p>
<p>Police are still investigating if the boy was shot by Rollins or Gaskill while the two exchanged gunfire.</p>
<h3><b>Huffman High School, Alabama</b></h3>
<p>A <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/03/08/alabama-student-killed-in-school-shooting-wanted-to-become-nurse-person-interest-in-custody.html" target="_blank">17-year old girl is dead</a> and one other person was left injured from a March 7 shooting at Huffman High School in Birmingham, Alabama.</p>
<p>Courtlin Arrington, 17, was killed when shots were fired in a classroom, Birmingham Police Chief Orlando Wilson told <a href="http://www.wbrc.com/story/37672258/person-of-interest-in-custody-in-huffman-hs-shooting-that-killed-1-student-another-injured" target="_blank">WBRC</a>. A 17-year-old male student was wounded. He was taken to the hospital and released.</p>
<p>Birmingham Police Department announced March 8 that a student was taken into custody in the investigation into the deadly shooting. Police said evidence, surveillance video and statements were reviewed throughout the night.</p>
<p>Police initially called the shooting “accidental,” but later reviewed a video that captured the deadly incident. </p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not saying he shot her, we&#8217;re not saying he didn&#8217;t shoot her,&#8221; the chief said. &#8220;We&#8217;re asking those questions ourselves so we can determine exactly what happened.&#8221;</p>
<h3><b>Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, Florida</b></h3>
<p>Police responded to <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/02/14/florida-high-school-under-lockdown-after-reports-shooter-victims-police-say.html" target="_blank">reports of shots</a> fired at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., around 3 p.m. on Feb. 14. <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/02/16/parkland-shooting-victims-include-young-students-coach-who-saved-others-in-florida-high-school.html" target="_blank">Seventeen people</a> lost their lives and 17 others were injured. </p>

<p>A 12-year-old girl was taken into custody after police said the loaded gun she brought to <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/02/01/los-angeles-school-shooting-1-person-in-custody.html" target="_blank">Salvador B. Castro Middle School</a> in Los Angeles accidentally discharged on Feb. 1, shooting a 15-year-old boy in the head and a 15-year-old girl in the wrist.</p>
<p>Police interviewed the 12-year-old student and agreed the shooting was accidental. She was booked in a juvenile detention center on suspicion of negligently discharging a firearm on school grounds.</p>

<p>Additionally, an 11-year-old boy and a 12-year-old girl were treated at the hospital and released while a 30-year-old woman, who is a school staff member, had only minor injuries, Los Angeles city police said in a statement.</p>

<h3>Italy High School, Texas</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/01/22/shooting-at-texas-high-school-suspect-in-custody-police-say.html" target="_blank">A 15-year-old girl was hurt</a> in a Jan. 22 shooting at Italy High School in Italy, Texas.

<p>In the school&#8217;s cafeteria, the suspect &#8220;engaged the victim&#8221; and fired several shots with a semi-automatic handgun, Ellis County Sheriff Chuck Edge said during a press briefing.</p>
<p>The suspect was confronted by an Italy Independent School District staffer in the school cafeteria and took off, Edge said. Law enforcement later apprehended the suspect on school grounds.</p>
<p>The suspect was charged with two counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, the Ellis County district attorney&#8217;s office announced.</p>
<h3>Aztec High School, New Mexico</h3>
<p>Gunman William Atchison, 21, <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/12/08/new-mexico-school-shooter-disguised-himself-as-student-to-get-into-building-police-say.html" target="_blank">disguised himself as a student</a> to get inside Aztec High School in Aztec, N.M., on Dec. 7, 2017, according to authorities. Atchison was also a former student. </p>
<p>State police said that Atchison killed students Francisco I. Fernandez and Casey J. Marquez.</p>
<p>Officials said Atchison eventually shot himself, adding that the students killed were not targeted, but were at the &#8220;wrong place at the wrong time.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Rancho Tehama Elementary School, California</h3>
<p>A man in Northern California went on a <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/11/15/california-gunmans-mother-says-was-frustrated-by-ongoing-feud-with-neighbors.html" target="_blank">random shooting rampage</a> on Nov. 14, 2017, killing five people and wounding at least a dozen adults and children before authorities shot and killed him.</p>
<p>The gunman, who was later identified as Kevin Neal, 44, rammed a car into the gates of Rancho Tehama Elementary School and shot at its portable classrooms. He repeatedly tried to get into a kindergarten classroom but quick-thinking staff locked the school down, and he eventually stormed off.</p>
<p>Neal reportedly targeted the elementary school as part of a long-running feud with neighbors.</p>

The shooting unfolded in Mattoon High School’s cafeteria around 11:30 a.m., officials said at the time.</p>
<p>One female teacher intervened and successfully subdued and disarmed the gunman &#8212; a move Mattoon Police Chief Jeff Branson said at the time was <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/midwest/ct-mattoon-high-school-shooting-teacher-20170921-story.html" target="_blank">“pivotal.”</a></p>
<p>The gunman was taken into custody shortly after the incident.</p>

<p>A 15-year-old student opened fire on fellow classmates at a Washington state high school on Sept. 13, 2017, killing one, investigators said. Caleb Sharpe, the suspected gunman, said the student who died had bullied him.</p>
<p>The slain student <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/09/14/officials-student-killed-confronting-shooter-at-high-school.html" target="_blank">tried to stop</a> the teen&#8217;s rampage when the gun jammed, according to <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/pacific-northwest-news/index.ssf/2017/09/washington_school_shooting_sus.html" target="_blank">The Associated Press</a>. A school janitor was <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/09/14/spokane-school-shooting-stopped-by-hero-janitor-authorities-say.html" target="_blank">hailed a hero</a> after he was able to subdue the alleged shooter.</p>
<p>Three other students were wounded in the attack. According to court documents, Sharpe told officials that he brought the two guns to school to “teach everyone a lesson about what happens when you bully others.”</p>
<h3>North Park Elementary School, California</h3>
<p>A special needs teacher and a child, 8, were killed in what police said was a <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/04/10/at-least-3-reportedly-shot-at-san-bernardino-elementary-school.html" target="_blank">murder-suicide at North Park Elementary School</a> in San Bernardino, California.</p>
<p>Police said Cedric Anderson walked into the school on April 10, 2017, and shot his estranged wife, Karen Elaine Smith. Two other students were also struck before Anderson killed himself, although law enforcement officials said they do not believe they were intended targets.</p>
<p>Jonathan Martinez was identified as the 8-year-old killed at the elementary school. A 9-year-old was injured.</p>
<h3>Liberty-Salem High School, Ohio</h3>

<p>Logan Cole, who was 16 at the time, was shot twice but survived. Another student was grazed by a bullet. Champaign County Sheriff Matthew Melvin said the gunman intended to harm more students than he did.</p>
<p>Ely Serna, the accused gunman, was 17 at the time of the shooting but is being tried as an adult in Champaign County court. He has <a href="http://www.mydaytondailynews.com/news/crime--law/west-liberty-salem-school-shooting-case-pushed-back-2018/NGROrKc1aatoWx7i76vwuK/" target="_blank">pleaded not guilty</a> by reason of insanity.</p>

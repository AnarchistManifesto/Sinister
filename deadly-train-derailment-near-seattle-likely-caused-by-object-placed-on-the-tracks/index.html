<p><strong>Update:</strong> Monday’s deadly Amtrak train derailment in Washington state appears to have been caused by an object on the railway, according to a government official briefed on the crash.</p>
<p><em>The <a href="https://nypost.com/2017/12/18/object-on-tracks-may-be-cause-of-deadly-amtrak-derailment/">Associated Press</a> reported that officials arrived at this conclusion following a brief investigation.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>A preliminary investigation suggests maintenance problems are unlikely to blame because the incident took place on brand-new tracks, the official told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.</em></p>
<p><em>At least six people were killed and the death toll is expected to rise, the official said.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>The Amtrak 501 plunged off an overpass onto I-5 near Lacey, Washington, sometime before 7:45 a.m., during its inaugural run between Seattle, Washington, and Portland, Oregon.</em></strong></p>
<p><em>During an afternoon briefing on his national security strategy, <strong>President Trump expressed “our deepest sympathies and most heartfelt prayers for the victims,” adding: “We are closely monitoring the situation and coordinating with local authorities.”</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To be sure, this is still a preliminary finding. At a press conference Monday, representatives from the NTSB said the investigation is ongoing…</p>
<p>However, comments from one local mayor who warned that the Amtrak project could jeapordize the safety of local are picking up more traction as the day goes on. We first noted the comments from Lakewood Mayor Don Anderson below. As it turns out, Anderson had raised safety concerns over the new itinerary, <u><strong>even predicting earlier this month that the new faster route would lead to fatal accidents.</strong></u></p>
<p>Anderson had raised safety concerns over the new itinerary, even predicting earlier this month that the new faster route would lead to fatal accidents.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> A local official has reportedly told the Associated Press that preliminary signs suggest that the Amtrak train may have struck something on the track before derailing…</p>
<p>To recap, there were 78 passengers and five crew members aboard when the train, moving at more than 80 mph, derailed about 40 miles (64 kilometers) south of Seattle before 8 am local time.</p>
<p>Trump offered more words of support for the victims of today’s crash during public comments about the US’s security strategy Monday afternoon.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the NTSB said it’s launching a “go team” to further investigate…</p>

<p>The White House is reportedly gearing up to introduce a <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-11-12/trump-infrastructure-plan-feasible">$1 trillion infrastructure plan </a>to rebuild America’s roads and bridges shortly after the new year.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p><strong>Update: </strong>The death toll has risen to six, <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/train-derails-from-bridge-onto-interstate-5-near-olympia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according</a> to local media reports. Meanwhile, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee has declared a state of emergency as first responders are still struggling to process the scene of the accident.</p>
<p>Providence St. Peter Hospital received 10 patients from the derailment, according to spokesperson Chris Thomas. Of those patients, two are still in surgery at the time. The other eight patients did not require surgery, and are being treated in the emergency room, according to Thomas.</p>
<p>Inslee’s state of emergency order means state agencies and departments will be able to tap into state resources in order to “do everything reasonably possible to assist affected political subdivisions in an effort to respond to and recover from the incidents.”</p>
<p><u><strong>Read the full order below:</strong></u></p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>WHEREAS, on the morning of December 18, 2017, an Amtrak Train derailed onto Interstate 5 at the Mounts Road overpass in Pierce County near the Thurston County line, resulting in loss of life, injuries, and damage to infrastructure; and…</p>
<p>WHEREAS, the derailment has caused significant structural damage to the overpass, railway and highway infrastructure, resulting in closure of the overpass and Interstate 5 for the safety of the travelling public until repairs can be completed; and…</p>
<p>WHEREAS, the effects of the derailment and related rail and highway closures impact the life and health of the people as well as the property and infrastructure of Washington State, all of which is a public disaster that affects life, health, property, or the public peace; and…</p>
<p>WHEREAS, the Washington Military Department has activated the State Emergency Operations Center, implemented response procedures, is coordinating resources to support state and local officials in alleviating the immediate social and economic impacts to people, property and infrastructure, and is continuing to assess impacts resulting from incident…</p>
<p>NOW, THEREFORE, I, Jay Inslee, Governor of the state of Washington, as a result of the above-noted situation, and under Chapters 38.08, 38.52 and 43.06 RCW, do hereby proclaim that a State of Emergency exists in Pierce and Thurston counties in the state of Washington, and direct the plans and procedures of the Washington State Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan be implemented. State agencies and departments are directed to utilize state resources and to do everything reasonably possible to assist affected political subdivisions in an effort to respond to and recover from the incidents.</p>
<p>As a result of this incident, I also hereby order into active state service the organized militia of Washington State to include the National Guard and the State Guard, or such part thereof as may be necessary in the opinion of The Adjutant General, to perform such duties as directed by competent authority of the Washington Military Department in addressing this event. Additionally, the Washington State Emergency Operations Center is instructed to coordinate all incident-related assistance to the affected areas.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> At least three people have been killed in today’s train derailment, according to the<a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/train-derails-from-bridge-onto-interstate-5-near-olympia/"> Seattle Times.</a></p>
<p>Though that figure may rise, as authorities are reporting “multiple” casualties.</p>
<p>Pierce County Sheriff’s spokesman Ed Troyer told news media that there were fatalities on the train and that motorists had been injured, but not killed. The full extent of the injuries is not yet known. It’s believed that, while several motorists sustained injuries, <strong>nobody driving under the bridge was killed.</strong></p>
<p>At least one train car fell on to the interstate below, as the photo above shows. Meanwhile, authorities say several vehicles on Interstate 5 were struck by the falling train cars when an Amtrak train derailed south of Seattle, and “multiple motorists” were injured on the roadway, according to the <a href="https://apnews.com/e239f41fefb64874a413e4cf42f744c0?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=AP">Associated Press.</a></p>
<blockquote>

<p>Chris Karnes, a passenger who was on the train three or four cars back from the front, spoke to a<a href="http://Chris%20Karnes%20was%20on%20the%20train,%20three%20or%20four%20cars%20back%20from%20the%20front.%20%20%E2%80%9CI%E2%80%99m%20not%20sure%20what%20got%20hit.%20I%E2%80%99m%20not%20sure%20what%20happened,%E2%80%9D%20Karnes%20said.%20%20He%20was%20unhurt%20but%20near%20the%20medical%20tents%20set%20up%20in%20a%20median%20area%20between%20north-%20and%20sound-bound%20I-5,%20just%20south%20of%20DuPont.%20%20%E2%80%9CThe%20only%20car%20that%20is%20on%20the%20tracks%20is%20the%20rear%20locomotive.%20There%20are%20several%20cars%20that%20are%20hanging%20over%20the%20overpass,%E2%80%9D%20Karnes%20said./"> local TV station.</a></p>
<p>“I’m not sure what got hit. I’m not sure what happened,” Karnes said.</p>
<p>He was unhurt but near the medical tents set up in a median area between north- and sound-bound I-5, just south of DuPont.</p>
<p>“The only car that is on the tracks is the rear locomotive. There are several cars that are hanging over the overpass,” Karnes said.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/dr-gridlock/wp/2017/12/18/amtrak-train-derails-in-washington-state-rail-cars-fall-onto-interstate-5/?utm_term=.bf6c5e578f09">WaPo</a>, Troyer told reporters that there are fatalities and that the property damage is “catastrophic.” <strong>He said first responders are “in the woods, using chainsaws” trying to get to people. <u>He couldn’t confirm the number of injured or dead.</u></strong></p>
<p>“A lot of things need to be done before anyone can confirm any numbers,” he said.</p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>The derailment occurred about halfway between Olympia and Tacoma, as the map below shows…</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-108302" src="http://theantimedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2017.12.18trainmaps_0.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="466"></p>
<p>As we noted earlier, the derailment happened on the first day that trains were running on a new high-speed route between Seattle and Portland. <strong>It was not immediately clear whether the derailment, which came during a busy travel time one week before the Christmas holiday, was connected to the new route.</strong></p>
<p>About 70 people were aboard the train, local news media reported, citing the state transportation department, according to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-washington-train/amtrak-train-derails-on-highway-bridge-in-washington-state-several-killed-idUSKBN1EC239">Reuters.</a></p>
<p>Authorities said 77 people were taken to the hospital.</p>
<p>“Thank you to the first responders on the scene. We’re praying for everyone on board the train, and ask everyone to hold them in your thoughts,” Washington Governor Jay Inslee wrote in a Twitter message.</p>
<p>In comments that may have proven eerily prescient, the mayor of one of the towns through which the rerouted trains travel warned earlier this month that the high-speed trains were dangerously close to cars and pedestrians.</p>
<p><strong>“Come back when there is that accident, and try to justify not putting in those safety enhancements, or you can go back now and advocate for the money to do it, because this project was never needed and endangers our citizens,”</strong>Lakewood Mayor Don Anderson told transportation officials in early December, according to Seattle’s KOMO News.</p>

<p>A day after a power failure<a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-12-17/pandemonium-atlanta-airport-power-outage-grounds-flights-traps-travelers-evacuation-"> at Atlanta’s Hartsfield Jackson Airport</a> – the busiest terminal in the world – left thousands of passengers stranded with flights only just beginning to resume, America’s crumbling infrastructure was on display yet again on Monday, but this time, the failure looks much more severe.</p>
<p>To wit, Amtrak train 501 derailed in Pierce County, about 40 miles south of Seattle, according to media reports and images showing the train tumbling off the tracks and on to the freeway below. The derailment happened at around 8 am local time – or 11 am Eastern.</p>

<p>“We don’t have any information at the moment, we’re gathering it,” said Keith Holloway, a spokesman for the National Transportation Safety Board.</p>
<p>“I was just shocked,” said Peter Zimmerman of Olympia. “I couldn’t believe it. It was like something out of a movie.” According to the local TV station, the train was traveling along a new high speed route from Seattle to Portland <strong>that had just opened Monday.</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-108306" src="http://theantimedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2017.12.18traintwo_0.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="264"></p>
<p>According to WSDOT, the train was running down a new bypass created to avoid slow curves and “single track tunnels on the BNSF Railway main line tracks near Point Defiance and along southern Puget Sound.”</p>
<p>The project rerouted passenger trains to an inland route on an existing rail line that runs along the west side of I-5 through south Tacoma, Lakewood and DuPont and then  reconnects back to the BNSF Railway main line near Nisqually on the east side of I-5.</p>
<p>The traffic back up is now three miles and growing. Monday morning was the first time Amtrak trains used the new Point Defiance Bypass route. It was the culmination of a $181 million project that began in 2010. A new Amtrak station also opened in Tacoma. <strong>The change would reduce the length of the trip by 10 minutes and separate Amtrak trains from freight lines that frequently cause delays on the Point Defiance route.</strong></p>

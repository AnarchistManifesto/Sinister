<p>Do you remember the Safe-Cyber instructions they taught you in the  mandatory Computer Ed class (operated by the National Institute of  Standards and Technology)? First you fire up your Secured Computing  Device (SCD) and its hardware token authenticator.</p>
<p>Then you enter the six-digit algorithmically generated password  displayed (a new one flashes every 60 seconds) and are asked to supply  your biometric identifier. You place your thumb on the built-in  fingerprint pad, click, and wait for the Internet connection to begin.  But it doesn’t.</p>
<p>Instead, the screen goes black for a second before the dreaded words  appear: “Malware has been detected on this SCD. As mandated by federal  law, it has been placed in quarantine.” Then the machine shuts down.</p>
<p>This is not just conjecture, but an imminent scenario.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>Policies, such as  the White House proposed “National Strategy for Trusted Identities in  Cyberspace,” which will transform the character, culture and freedom of  the Internet, are already in place. The 20 cybersecurity-related bills  introduced in the Senate in 2011, and the dozen introduced in the House  of Representatives, have wound their way through committees and,  according to Senator Harry Reid, are scheduled to be voted on in the  first quarter of 2012. Almost all of them, with the blessing of the  White House, would make the Department of Homeland Security the overseer  of private-sector networks.</p>
<div align="center">
</div>
<p>
Considering the apocalyptic rhetoric coming from Washington and the  ranks of cybersecurity experts – echoed by media reports that portray  every picayune data breach as Armageddon – it would appear that the  vulnerability of the Internet has been underplayed for many years.</p>
<p>In the Internet’s start-up decades, both industry and government were  committed to establishing an atmosphere of trust that would draw the  public into conducting more and more digital business. Though data  breaches, theft of trade secrets, identity theft and bank robbery have  been a fact of Internet life since its beginnings, there were few laws  requiring disclosure. Banks and credit card firms ate their losses as a  cost of doing business, and the giant corporations kept mum rather than  roil the public. Recently, the pendulum has swung in the other direction  and a raucous alarm has been sounded regarding the great danger posed  by the Internet.</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>The Nation is at a crossroads. The globally-interconnected digital  information and communications infrastructure known as “cyberspace”  underpins almost every facet of modern society and provides critical  support for the U.S. economy, civil infrastructure, public safety, and  national security. This technology has transformed the global economy  and connected people in ways never imagined. Yet, cybersecurity risks  pose some of the most serious economic and national security challenges  of the 21st century. The digital infrastructure’s architecture was  driven more by considerations of interoperability and efficiency than of  security. Consequently, a growing array of state and non-state actors  are compromising, stealing, changing, or destroying information and  could cause critical disruptions to U.S. systems. (White House  Cyberspace Policy Review, 2011)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While there may be other factors behind the current wave of  cybersecurity alarmism, we have identified three major forces: The  Government, the Cybersecurity-Industrial complex, and the so-called  “Hacktivists.”</p>
<p><b>The Hacktivists</b></p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>
<script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script></div>

<p>LulzSec and Anonymous, the  most-publicized of the hacktivists, along with a growing community of ad  hoc cyberactors, have had a multi-faceted impact on the cybersecurity  environment that goes far beyond the number of hackers at work or the  amount of actual damage their exploits have inflicted.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/privacy-crisis.html" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_qLAIskTQXUc/TW6zd_MzhbI/AAAAAAAAHPE/DBvoPT_wz5M/pc150x225.gif"></a>They have skillfully publicized their outsized, headline-ready  cyberintrusions. Their attacks, which are something other than the  garden variety cybercrime, have compromised the web assets of Sony, the  CIA, Fox News, the Church of Scientology, Bank of America and many more.  Beyond the financial damage and security breaches, they’ve created a  public relations nightmare forcing these major institutions to go public  with what they would otherwise go to great lengths to conceal.</p>
<p>As a result, attention has been focused on the inadequacies of Internet  security. If organizations as large, powerful and security-conscious as  these are vulnerable, who then is safe? Not only have the targets been  breached and embarrassed, consumer trust in the Internet has also been  shaken.</p>
<p>These high-profile, anarchic Internet exploits – compounded by the role  of social media in evading and undermining government control of the  political and media arena (Arab Spring, Occupy Wall Street, etc.) – have  intensified government efforts to clamp down on the Internet … while  providing the media with scary cyber-stories to further that agenda.</p>
<p><b>The Government</b></p>
<p>The US government agenda to control the  Internet is at least a decade old. Just three months after the Bush  White House created the Department of Homeland Security, it issued “The  National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace.” The document begins:</p>
<p>My Fellow Americans:</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>The way business is transacted, government operates, and national  defense is conducted have changed. These activities now rely on an  interdependent network of information technology infrastructures called  cyberspace. The National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace provides a  framework for protecting this infrastructure that is essential to our  economy, security, and way of life. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>In the past few years, threats in cyberspace have risen dramatically.  The policy of the United States is to protect against the debilitating  disruption of the operation of information systems for critical  infrastructures and, thereby, help to protect the people, economy, and  national security of the United States.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nearly a decade later, the basic message from the White House sounds  much the same, if louder and more urgent. But there is a big difference.  President Obama, and the rest of the Beltway insiders, have now  formally defined cyberspace as a “strategic national asset.”</p>
<p>On the face of it, this appears to be a reasonable approach for a world  that has become, in a relatively short time, totally dependent on  digital resources. Unfortunately, it is an approach that provides a  straight path to the militarization of the Internet and the loss of  liberty that will follow. It is an approach that will elevate the most  common forms of cybercrime (bank robbery, credit card theft) to the  high-alert status of a cyberwar attack.</p>
<p>This government mindset will lead to the same abrogation of individual  rights in cyberspace as the National Defense Appropriations Act of 2012  has codified in “Battlefield America.”</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>Given the integrated nature of cyberspace, computer-induced failures of  power grids, transportation networks, or financial systems could cause  massive physical damage and economic disruption. DoD operations – both  at home and abroad – are dependent on this critical infrastructure. As  military strength ultimately depends on economic vitality, sustained  intellectual property losses erode both U.S. military effectiveness and  national competitiveness in the global economy. Cyber hygiene must be  practiced by everyone at all times; it is just as important for  individuals to be focused on protecting themselves as it is to keep  security software and operating systems up to date. (Department of  Defense Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace, July 2011)</p>
</blockquote>
<div style="float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><a href="http://activistpost.net/celltrack.html" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-NduLNqEiSGI/Tx3Nxjq9ITI/AAAAAAAAOJU/mKq82IYT3ac/s200/mmm-200x167-v4.gif"></a></div>
<p>Many Internet experts and cybersecurity professionals have deemed 2011  “The Year of the Hack,” in recognition of the unending stream of  headlines related to data breaches and thefts. We believe that – aside  from any real uptick in cybercrime or cyberwarfare skirmishes – this  perception is the result of the government’s determination to soften up  the public to meekly accept an upcoming barrage of Internet regulation.  It is a digital-age version of the tried and true fear mongering that is  always employed to further empower the president and further enrich the  military/industrial and Homeland Security complex. The government says  it’s not fear mongering, just education.</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>The national dialogue on cybersecurity must begin today. The government,  working with industry, should explain this challenge and discuss what  the Nation can do to solve problems in a way that the American people  can appreciate the need for action. People cannot value security without  first understanding how much is at risk. Therefore, the Federal  government should initiate a national public awareness and education  campaign informed by previous successful campaigns. (White House  Cyberspace Policy Review, 2011)</p>

<p><b>The Prominence of the Non-military Aspects of Warfare.</b></p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>Non-military means of warfare, such as cyber, economic, resource,  psychological, and information-based forms of conflict will become more  prevalent in conflicts over the next two decades. In the future, states  and non-state adversaries will engage in ‘media warfare’ to dominate the  24-hour news cycle and manipulate public opinion to advance their own  agenda and gain popular support for their cause. (“Global Trends 2025,”  National Intelligence Council, 2008)</p>

<p>A key point being used to “educate” the  public is the putative astronomical monetary loss caused by cybercrime  in all its forms. There is, of course, no way to ascertain the validity  of these numbers or even to figure out just what kind of losses are  included in the estimates, which are generally arrived at by the large  cybersecurity corporations. Some loss-figures appear to include the fall  in a company’s stock price that usually follows revelation of a major  hack (but doesn’t adjust that figure when the stock price climbs back  up), as well as adding in an arbitrary sum attributable to time lost in  recovery.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/privacy-crisis.html" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/_qLAIskTQXUc/TW6zeORrPcI/AAAAAAAAHPI/c6vrzCsVYJU/privacy1.jpg"></a>The largest global estimate of money lost to cybercrime currently  floating around – as totted up by McAfee, the world’s largest  cybersecurity company and endorsed by the White House – is $1 trillion a  year. Symantec Corp., another cybersecurity giant, calculates the  annual toll of global cybercrime to be about $388 billion. For dramatic  impact, Symantec notes that figure is greater than the black market in  marijuana, cocaine and heroin combined. Either of those (wildly  divergent) sums is impressive, but do they mean anything? Or are they  just part of a government “education campaign modeled on previous  successful campaigns,” such as selling the public on the certainty of  WMDs in Hussein’s Iraq?</p>
<p>Far from being broadly based estimates of losses across the population,  the cyber-crime estimates that we have appear to be largely the answers  of a handful of people extrapolated to the whole population. A single  individual who claims $50,000 losses, in an N = 1000 person survey, is  all it takes to generate a $10 billion loss over the population. One  unverified claim of $7,500 in phishing losses translates into $1.5  billion.</p>
<p>Our assessment of the quality of cyber-crime surveys is harsh: they are  so compromised and biased that no faith whatever can be placed in their  findings.</p>
<p>There has long been a shortage of hard data about information security  failures, as many of the available statistics are not only poor but are  collected by parties such as security vendors or law enforcement  agencies that have a vested interest in under- or over-reporting. (“Sex,  Lies and Cyber-crime Surveys,” Microsoft Research)</p>
<p><b>The Cybersecurity-Industrial Complex</b></p>
<p>The fear,  uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) surrounding cyberspace has helped turn  cybersecurity into an enormously profitable business, worth between $60  and $100 billion a year, depending on who’s providing the statistics.  The sector is expected to grow 10 percent annually for at least the next  five years. You don’t have to attribute any ethical lapses in the  cybersecurity industry to recognize that it, like the government, has a  great interest in “educating” the public in cybersecurity awareness.</p>
<p>Security experts say that it is virtually impossible for any company or  government agency to build a security network that hackers will be  unable to penetrate. (Reuters, 27 May 2011)</p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>The military-industrial complex of the Cold War era has morphed into the  cybersecurity-military/industrial-Homeland Security complex of the  Cyber War era … to which there is no end in sight. With the  cybersecurity industry creating the technology required to stem the very  cyberattacks they are in charge of discovering and monitoring, we face  an endless cyberarms race that will undoubtedly be fed on exaggerations  of the virtual menace and our vulnerability to it.</p>
<p>On the heels of the fear and hysteria will come the firm push for strict  control and regulation of the Internet. It will be championed by  government and industry as the necessary response to cyberwar,  cyberterrorism, and cybercrime which, since cyberspace is considered a  “strategic national asset,” are essentially all the same.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/autopilot.html" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-BWwQvx0mWFc/Tx3M3fCrPNI/AAAAAAAAOJM/py5ko9h9TKs/s200/200x167.gif"></a>The Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) for instance, which is scheduled for a  vote in 2012, will take a page from the National Defense Appropriation  Act of 2012. In order to protect the rights of copyright holders to  profit from their intellectual property, SOPA would permit the  dissolution of due process and open the door wide to censorship and the  denial of the right to free speech. The bill, supporters suggest, is not  just about recovering the billions lost to bootlegged movies and music,  rather, it’s about protecting the military strength that ultimately  depends on economic vitality.</p>
<p>We agree with The Electronic Frontier Foundation, which has called SOPA  the most extreme, anti-Internet, anti-privacy, anti-free speech  copyright proposal in US legislative history. It is, however, only one  of many legislative proposals likely to be steamrollered through  Congress in the coming year.</p>
<p>Computer security expert Eugene Kaspersky, co-founder of Kaspersky Labs,  envisions the “passportization” of the Internet. In his opinion, to  access critical online services, such as banking or electronic voting,  “it should be made mandatory to log-on only with the use of a unique  personal identifier [for example, a token – a sort of cyber-passport]  and establish a secure authoring connection.”</p>
<p>Microsoft has proposed what it calls a “public health model” for the  Internet. Cybercitizens would be required to have a “clean bill of  health,” make their computers open to inspection, and, if contaminated  by a virus or other malware, be prepared for quarantine.</p>
<p>President Obama’s National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace  is pushing for development and public adoption of Internet user  authentication systems that will function as a driver’s license for the  cyberhighway.</p>
<p>Government control of the flow of information will strike a blow against  Internet anonymity and the free speech it has made possible. Driver’s  license, bill of health, passport, whatever you call it – it’s all about  the ability to track and control the individual. Today, traffic in  copyrighted digital material is the criminal behavior supposedly under  attack; tomorrow, it will be the ability to speak out against corrupt  government.</p>
<p>Hello, Big Brother.</p>
<p><b>Trendpost:</b> <i>The demand for ever-more effective  cybersecurity tools to counter the ever-more inventive depredations of  cybercriminals and cyberwarriors will be with us far into the  foreseeable future. Clearly, this situation will create many jobs, both  for the formally educated and the creative hacker. In addition, The  National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education – established to provide  cyber-awareness training to students in Kindergarten through  post-graduate programs – will need many specialized teachers.</i></p>
<p>Somewhat farther along on the timeline, there is a high likelihood that  the manufacture of cyber-components will be repatriated to the US. The  2011 Department of Defense’s “Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace”  notes: “The majority of information technology products used in the  United States are manufactured and assembled overseas. The reliance of  DoD on foreign manufacturing and development creates challenges in  managing risk at points of design, manufacture, service, distribution,  and disposal.”</p>
<p>A high probability exists that 2012 will bring revelations about  contamination in the global IT hardware and software supply chain and  proof that computer components are providing our “enemies” with entry to  critical networks or transmitting sensitive information to them. This  will turn the DoD’s security concern into a hot imperative.</p>

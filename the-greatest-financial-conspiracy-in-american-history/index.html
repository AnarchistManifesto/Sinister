<b><a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2013/09/the-greatest-financial-conspiracy-in.html">Activist Post</a></b></p>
<p>There is a conspiracy being perpetrated against the American people with regard to the true nature of America’s financial situation. To most people, America appears to be on her last economic legs and the future looks hopeless. On the other hand, America has never been wealthier. However, the wealth has been hoarded and hidden from the American people.</p>
<p>This article exposes why the central bankers and the corporate-controlled media are attempting to make it appear as though America is dead broke with no hope of recovery. The central bankers, through the government, have indeed hijacked and are hoarding and hiding substantial assets as they are planning to take the surface economy down as early as this fall/winter. The globalist strategy consists of convincing the people, in advance of the collapse, that there is no hope of economic recovery. Under this scenario, the perpetrators of the collapse will meet with less direct resistance, both in the collapse phase and in the recovery phase in which we will all witness the establishment of a world government and a one world economic system.</p>
<p>Which side is correct? Are we broke or do we have substantial hidden assets?</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>Both sides are correct. The visible economy, which is obvious to all (e.g. the health of the fiat currency, the unemployment rate, national GDP relative to the planet’s GDP), clearly indicates that a collapse is imminent. However, there is also substantial wealth that is being hoarded on behalf of the banks and corporations by their governmental partners, which could make a significant difference in the health of our economy. The wealth is substantial and has successfully been hidden from most Americans.</p>
<p><b>The Case for a Looming Economic Collapse</b></p>
<p>The undoing of the American currency has been a century in the making. In 1913, the most evil organization on the earth was created by an unconscionable act of Congress with the creation of the Federal Reserve. The United States national debt is more than <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/is-the-federal-reserve-doing-a-good-job">5000 times larger</a> than it was when the <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/category/federal-reserve">Federal Reserve</a> was first created, and this fact has served to turn nearly all of us into debt slaves with each of us vulnerable to the manipulation of the global elite.</p>

<p>
The <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/who-runs-the-world-solid-proof-that-a-core-group-of-wealthy-elitists-is-pulling-the-strings">bankers</a> who helped to create the Federal Reserve intended to permanently enslave the U.S. government to a perpetually expanding spiral of debt. Their plan has worked, and their final victory is nearly at hand.</p>
<p>Boston University economist <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-08/blink-u-s-debt-just-grew-by-11-trillion.html">Laurence Kotlikoff</a>, stated that the U.S. government is facing a “present value difference between projected future spending and revenue” of <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-08/blink-u-s-debt-just-grew-by-11-trillion.html">222 trillion dollars</a> in the years ahead. Where are we going to come up with 222 trillion dollars? The short answer is that we won’t under the existing set of economic rules that we are forced to live under.</p>
<p>In 2001, the United States represented <a href="http://acrossthestreetnet.wordpress.com/2012/11/28/the-cost-of-kidding-yourself/">31.8 percent </a>of the world’s economic activity.  By the end of 2011, that share had dropped to 21.6%, which means that America’s portion of the world’s economy is 32% smaller than it was a decade ago and it is declining more with each passing day. With economic indicators such as these, there is no way to climb out of the economic hole we have entered courtesy of the globalist-inspired free-trade agreements (i.e. NAFTA, CAFTA and now the MEFTA, AFTA and the TPP). With these kinds of economic indicators, more Americans will be competing for a smaller number of jobs that are significantly declining in pay.</p>
<p>Over one hundred million unemployed Americans are no longer even looking for work. The next time you go into the Department of Motor Vehicles, please realize that you are subsidizing a driver’s license for about a third of the people in that building. You are also paying for their health care, food stamps and shelter. And many of these lower class, poverty-stricken “Americans” have a higher standard of living than you, and this is by design courtesy of Chairman Obama.</p>
<p><b>It Does Not Pay to Go to Work</b></p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/backyardliberty.html" rel="nofollow" style="float: right;margin-left: 1em;margin-bottom: 0em"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ONE8Lk_RzR8/UjeZnRyZRTI/AAAAAAAAVJw/TMNS4NzHKZo/s220/BL_158220.gif" alt=""></a><a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/article/entitlement-america-head-household-making-minimum-wage-has-more-disposable-income-family-mak">Wayne Emmerich</a> found that the family breadwinner who works only one week a month at minimum wage makes 92% as much as the breadwinner grossing $60,000 a year. <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/article/entitlement-america-head-household-making-minimum-wage-has-more-disposable-income-family-mak">Emmerich’s stats</a> demonstrate that by working only one week a month one can save a lot of money in <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/article/entitlement-america-head-household-making-minimum-wage-has-more-disposable-income-family-mak">child care</a> expense. But topping the list is Medicaid, which is accessible to minimum wage earners, and the program has very low deductibles and co-pays. In short, by working only one week a month at a minimum wage job, a minimum wage earner is able to get total <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/article/entitlement-america-head-household-making-minimum-wage-has-more-disposable-income-family-mak">medical coverage</a> for next to nothing courtesy of you and me.</p>
<p>The middle class is not as lucky, as the $60,000 breadwinner pays out approximately $12,000 per year in health insurance costs with an addition $4,500 in co-pays. And if anyone in the part-time minimum wage earning family is disabled, SSI pays out an additional $8,088 per year. When one begins to calculate the expenses incurred by a typical breadwinner making $60,000 per year, compared to the part-time minimum wage worker, coupled with minimum wage earners’ tax-supported federal bailouts for these freeloaders, the poor have more discretionary income than those who pay the taxes that run the country. And if the part-time minimum wage worker is willing to cheat and participate in the underground economy, they will have significantly more discretionary income than their hard-working $60,000 per year counterpart. In short, if you are a full-time employee making above minimum wage, you are paying for your own economic demise. The numbers here suggest that we’d be better off staying home and living off of the labors of what’s left of the middle class … but of course this would help to collapse the economy.</p>
<p><b>Unbearable Taxes Are Leading to Record Expatriation Rates</b></p>
<p>Overwhelmingly, the number one reason that Americans are fleeing the country is because of high taxes. The income tax rate <a href="http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/UploadedPDF/412730-Tax-Provisions-in-ATRA.pdf">rose this year</a> to 39.6% from 35% for individuals earning more than $400,000 a year and married couples earning more than $450,000. As of this year, 77% of Americans will pay higher federal tax rates because the cuts in Social Security payroll taxes expired when Congress passed its tax package on New Year’s Day. The Tax Policy Center estimates that those who earn more than $1 million would pay an <a href="http://taxpolicycenter.org/numbers/Content/PDF/T12-0428.pdf">average of $170,341 more in taxes</a>. The tax burden is adding crushing weight to a beleaguered upper- and middle-class America.</p>
<p><b>Hiding and Hoarding Massive Assets That Could Rescue the Country’s Economy</b></p>
<p>Americans are lamenting the fact that our budget deficit is now over $17 trillion dollars. Our national debt and deficit is a drop in the bucket compared to the assets that our government controls. However, far beneath the ground, the federal government owns the rights to mineral and energy leases, from which they receive royalties, rent, and bonus payments, states <a href="http://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/?p=15346">the Institute for Energy Research, an industry group</a>. According to their estimates, government states that the assets are worth <a href="http://thecommonsenseshow.com/2013/02/06/america-is-not-broke-we-are-being-lied-to/:%20http:/www.businessinsider.com/bureau-of-land-management-is-sitting-on-128-trillion-of-minerals-2013-2#ixzz2K8qFDOxS">$128 trillion</a>. That’s almost eight times the national debt. This is a hard asset which could be collateralized and matched against the deficit.</p>
<p>“These <a href="http://thecommonsenseshow.com/2013/02/06/america-is-not-broke-we-are-being-lied-to/:%20http:/www.businessinsider.com/bureau-of-land-management-is-sitting-on-128-trillion-of-minerals-2013-2#ixzz2K8qFDOxS">resources</a> could be leased to third parties and could subsequently earn the state and national government huge royalties, rents, and bonus payments that it is estimated could total almost $150 billion over 10 years, just for the oil and gas leases alone.” Then why isn’t this being done? Simple, ask yourself who would lose money if these idle assets were to brought to fruition? The oil companies would lose money, that’s who! The same oil companies that block oil drilling on the North Shore of Alaska. The same oil companies who preserve the existing relationship with Middle Eastern nations, which someday will pull us into a devastating world war with Syria and Iran.</p>
<p>Further, the unleashing of these assets would reduce the costs of energy for consumers and businesses. Now, the owners of the utilities, the same people who are the owners of the oil companies, could not permit that. The utilities have invested billions toward the installation of smart meters and a new infrastructure smart grid, in which they control all energy pricing.</p>

But when the globalists’ goal is the creation of a one world economic system, based upon keeping nations in debt, controlled by a tyrannical one world government, the old government and economy must be brought down and this economic boon to the economy cannot be allowed to transpire. Therefore, the government acts as a procurement agent for the globalists, who will eventually unleash these assets to themselves, after the collapse of the dollar.</p>
<p><b>CAFR’S the Source of Untold Wealth</b></p>
<p>For over a decade, accountant Walter Burien, has been trying to raise public consciousness over what he says is a massive conspiracy, totaling trillions of dollars. The conspiracy, Burien says, is one in which governments at all levels have hidden away funds in a practice commonly called CAFRs. Burien’s numbers may be questioned, but there can be no doubt that significant hidden funds clearly exist. The existence of CAFRs are evidenced by the existence of the Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports (CAFRs). CAFRs are a required aspect of every government agency accounting practices. Therefore, the existence of this underground slush fund is a matter of public record.</p>
<p>The subject of CAFRs first came to light when Colonel Gerald Klatt alerted Burien to their existence. Coincidentally, Klatt died under very <a href="http://www.cafr1.com/">mysterious circumstances</a> in 2004, which lent credence to the claim that there was a conspiracy to cover up the scope and true nature of CAFRs. Just what is a CAFR and how does it explain how the American people are being lied to about how much money truly exists within the control of the government?</p>
<p>To help you understand the nature and process of CAFRs, let’s pretend that you were to have a checking account with $100 and a savings account with $1,000 in two different banks. Let’s further imagine that you only reported to the IRS that you only had $100 dollars as your net worth because you don’t want to use your savings account to pay bills (i.e. taxpayer obligations). Subsequently, you’d be audited and put in a federal prison for failure to report the larger amount. However, the government grants itself permission to play by its own rules and to make up the CAFR rules as they go along. The government, as described in the above example, simply designates that it has two accounts (i.e. the $100 account and the $1,000 (CAFR) savings account).</p>
<p>However, the larger CAFR account is designated as “non-governmental” or “non-taxpayer” income and this allows the government to hide all of this wealth from the people as reported in the government’s Budget Report. In this economic scenario, only the smaller account is the one that gets declared. And the reason that governments continue to engage in this shady practice is that they want to be able to justify the taking of a greater portion of your income through increased taxation. I call this highway robbery. As an aside, have you noticed that many counties are building monumental justice centers which defy description of where the funds came from given the present state of economic affairs. These centers are being built with CAFRs which are monetized in a variety of ways.</p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>The subject of CAFRs is something that has come into my life with an explosion. In Maricopa County (greater Phoenix area), former county attorney, Andrew Thomas, was disbarred eighteen months ago. A three-member panel found that former County Attorney Andrew Thomas violated the professional rules of conduct for lawyers in bringing criminal charges against two county officials and a judge in December 2009. What gets lost in the media reporting of Thomas’ sudden departure from office and his disbarment is why Thomas was prosecuting two county officials, County Supervisors Dan Stapely and Mary Rose Wilcox as well as Superior Court Judge Gary Donahoe. Thomas initiated the investigation with allegations of financial wrongdoing on the part of the three individuals. The second phase of his investigation was to attack the use of off-the-books funds (i.e. CAFRs).Thomas was gone from office before phase two of his legal action could be commenced and Arpaio was neutralized.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/ultimatesurvivalplan.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-CTsdDqKcvhI/T7GjToaksaI/AAAAAAAAO2s/8vEb9HmqOhk/s316/160x316.gif"></a>A few years ago, Maricopa County just completed the building of an expensive justice center worth more than 500 million dollars. Where did the money come from, as it has repeatedly been reported in the Phoenix media that the County is broke? Who benefited? Thomas found evidence of money being kept off of the books and was attempting to expose it and the forces of the establishment had him expelled from office and disbarred within months of the first accusations. Simultaneously, Sheriff Joe Arpaio was complicit in the ill-fated Thomas investigation by carrying out the investigation and participating in the arrests of the three officials.</p>
<p>Shortly thereafter, Arpaio was the source of a massive Eric Holder-led justice probe into his department’s alleged racial profiling of illegal immigrants in Maricopa County. Arpaio brilliantly retaliated with an investigation into the authenticity of Obama’s long form birth certificate. Obama was declared, by Arpaio, to be ineligible to appear on Arizona’s ballot for President in 2012. Then the controversy went dark and the back and forth between the Feds and Arpaio disappeared from the front page of the newspapers. Obama eventually appeared on the ballot and Arpaio received a mere slap on the wrist from the Department of Justice. Can anyone say “a deal was struck?”  Apraio survived because he had leverage against Obama and Andrew Thomas did not; and, subsequently, Thomas’ license to practice law was revoked by a three-judge panel which operated in the spirit of the worst of any kind of Kangaroo court.</p>
<p>If the Thomas case had been fully exposed to the media, the subject of CAFRs would have been irrevocably exposed. The obfuscation of public funds issue appeared to be dead. However, I had an inside source come forward and his name is Doug Rhoads. Doug is a former Maricopa County prosecutor. He approached me in early June of 2013 after reading a multi-part series that I had published on my website regarding the privatization of for-profit prisons and the fact that many states were promising private corporations a 90% prison occupancy rate, thus driving up zealousness of criminal prosecutions aimed at keeping the prisons full and profits high.</p>
<p>Doug Rhoads informed me that every one of these criminal cases were being monetized as a traded commodity on the market and that the earned money went off the books. Doug subsequently appeared on my talk show for two hours and exposed the fact that this was indeed taking place, and we also discussed the Andrew Thomas affair. Since the airing of this interview with Rhoads, I have been personally threatened on two occasions that if I continued to report on prison privatization and the Rhoads revelations of hidden public assets, there would be “grave consequences.” Also, since the Rhoads interview, I have been contacted by several people, each with a different angle on this situation. However, all of them are afraid for their careers and their lives if their whistleblowing were to ever be exposed.</p>
<p>The issue and existence of CAFRs is being zealously guarded. The release of CAFRs, alone, could erase our national debt and return financial affluence to America. For example, California Governor Brown, claims that the California’s state budget deficit of $16 billion requires austerity actions. However, the <a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/does-california-need-a-600-billion-investment-fund-given-our-austerity">state’s CAFR funds revealed $600 billion</a> in undeclared assets. When all the CAFR surplus accounts are totaled, <a href="http://cafr1.com/challenge.html">Californians have been overtaxed by $8 trillion dollars in a sampled study</a>. This is being done at every level of government, two sets of books and two sets of figures. You do not have to be living in California and Arizona to be the victim of this deception, it is in every state. This makes the national debt appear to be meaningless.</p>

</div>
<p>And whatever happened to Col. Klatt, the man who first revealed the existence of the CAFRs? He suffered a worse fate than Andrew Thomas; he was likely murdered, as Klatt served for a long time as an Air Force auditor and federal accountant, and it’s likely that he got too close to some military CAFRs being used for “off the books” operations and he died under very mysterious circumstances. Google “Walter Burien” and be prepared to get really upset about how much money is being withheld by government in this unholy accounting practice.</p>
<p><b>What Does It All Mean?</b></p>
<p>Through CAFRs, the government is clearly hoarding money. Where does the money go? Nobody can be certain except that it makes the lion’s share of money collected eligible to be used as off-the-books spending.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/backyardliberty.html" rel="nofollow" style="float: right;margin-left: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-S6RfjP7Lvo8/USlEmRqWjJI/AAAAAAAAUgk/Zio_5z2T_gE/s200/prep.gif" alt=""></a>This is where the plot thickens and things get very interesting. If the economy is collapsed due to the well-publicized debt listed in the first part of this article, it is not known what would happen to the CAFRs, the underground mineral resources, etc. Since these assets are technically off the books and under the control of local governments and many of their corporate NGOs, they would presumably be unaffected in an economic collapse scenario. And wouldn’t that be the goal of banking interests who would want to collapse the economy in that they would want to procure as many hard assets as possible before the collapse? Since government at all levels has repeatedly proven itself to be agents of the megabanks and the corporations, these institutions would survive an economic collapse with a great deal of hard assets. </p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p>I have concluded that the powers-that-be are hoarding hard assets as a means to maintain power following the economic reorganization which would follow a collapse. Further, this theory is further bolstered by the fact that Federal Reserve continues to buy $40 billion of mortgage backed securities every month and MERS is continuing their theft of home mortgages at record rates. This scenario looks like the globalists are following a massive wealth transfer scenario and the pace of this wealth transfer is accelerating. What is the rush? Could it be that what I wrote about two weeks ago is indeed coming into play?</p>
<p>The GRID EX II drill in which the power grid is being “taken down in a simulation,” is something that cannot be easily dismissed as the next false flag event. However, this is eerily similar to what happened in 9/11 and the 7/7 bombings as well as the Boston Marathon bombing in which a drill culminated in a false flag attack. If the grid is taken down, and as I have stated before, a false flag within a false flag can be executed and the banks can be collapsed and the country will barely notice. Who would notice the missing digits in their bank accounts when the grid is down and the people are starving by the third day following the blackout? Meanwhile, government, as well as their banking and corporate partners, would hold most of the hard assets in the country following an economic collapse and would stand to be in a position of extreme power when the smoke eventually clears.</p>
<p>In this scenario, the largest remaining asset that the banks would not totally control would be the privately owned homes and businesses. But after a collapse how would people pay their mortgage? The short answer is that they could not. And who would the deeds revert to? They would revert to the banks.</p>
<p>Although I think this scenario is likely, this is only a theory regarding the tie-in with GRID EX II, hidden wealth and collusion to collapse the economy in order to transfer wealth and to consolidate holdings. However, what is not a theory is the fact that our hidden assets outnumbers the sum total of our debt as a nation, and the debt and the deficit could be paid off overnight should the people wake up and force the government to release the true wealth of the country.</p>

<a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2014/02/request-for-investigation-of-documented.html"><b>Activist Post</b></a></p>
<p>I’m an engineer residing in the suburbs of Charlotte, NC and I have been documenting large-scale, aerial chemical-dispersals from aircraft over the city through time-lapse photography.</p>
<p>Here is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BJpluK3Jp4http://youtu.be/3BJpluK3Jp4?t=1m33s">time-lapse video of a massive, all-day dispersal on Sunday 1/26/14</a>. </p>
<p>[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BJpluK3Jp4?feature=player_detailpage]</p>
<p>Here it is sped up by 2x, for those pressed for time:<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uh1aJsr4DcM"> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uh1aJsr4DcM</a> </p>
<p>Photos and real-time video of the skies over Charlotte being nearly completely covered in a chemical haze on this same day can be found <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/charlottechemtrails12614/home">here</a> (from various spots around the city).</p>
<p>These spraying operations can change a clear blue sky to a chalky white sky, from horizon to horizon, in a matter of hours.</p>
<p>My research to understand the reasons behind these chemical dispersals over my house and city (through what looks like jet contrail amplification) has led me to propose that these jet-aerosol spraying events are a sub-project of a global “geoengineering” program known as “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_radiation_management">solar radiation management</a>” which is being conducted through so-called “<a href="http://www.lwec.org.uk/sites/default/files/Geoengineering%20meeting_Matthew%20Watson.pdf">stratospheric particle injections</a>.” (“Geoengineering” is the large-scale manipulation of earth’s physical systems.)</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<div align="center">
<ins class="adsbygoogle" style="height: 60px;width: 468px"></ins></p>
<p>    <a href="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js">//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js</a><br />
    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || ).push({});

<p>
Indeed, a survey of the patent and technical literature reveals that the deliberate intensification of jet contrail formation is considered the most cost-effective method under consideration as a technique for weather modification and global warming amelioration. To implement this agenda with jet-aircraft, geoengineers are discussing the use of fuel additives, customized engines, after-burner injections, and extra fuel tanks for dispensing experimental chemicals. </p>
<p>The scope of these <a href="http://climate.envsci.rutgers.edu/pdf/StratosphericAerosolGeoengineering4.pdf">stratospheric aerosol geoengineering</a> projects needs to be understood by the public because, despite their far-reaching goals, they are being implemented “under the radar,” <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/graphic/2012/jul/17/geoengineering-world-map">all over the world</a>, even as their well-paid proponents admit these programs could create a global ice age or alter global rainfall patterns and affect the food supply for billions of people.</p>
<p>Alarmingly, the intensity of the spray incidents over Charlotte, N.C. seems to have increased dramatically in 2014. I have posted numerous time-lapse videos of these chemical dispersals on <a href="http://youtube.com/">youtube.com</a>, the most recent being a massive, all-day chemical spray incident that occurred Sunday, 2/2/14. Here are two time-lapse views of the afternoon:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG9Zf9Pl_jc">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG9Zf9Pl_jc</a></p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p><a href="http://youtu.be/GU0Spikqftw?t=2m19s">http://youtu.be/GU0Spikqftw?t=2m19s</a></p>
<p>And here is a recent time-lapse video of a chemical “sheet” being dumped over my house on January 9, 2014:</p>
<p>[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI2exyqUFUE?feature=player_detailpage]<br />
<a href="http://youtu.be/fI2exyqUFUE?t=2m49s">http://youtu.be/fI2exyqUFUE?t=2m49s</a></p>
<p>The pervasive white haze in the sky that resulted from the spreading of “persistent contrails” over Charlotte on these days is curiously consistent with the predicted side-effect of proposed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_engineering">climate engineering programs</a> discussed in recent news articles (“<a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn21873-geoengineering-would-turn-blue-skies-whiter.html">Geoengineering would turn blue skies whiter</a>”).</p>
<p>Some of these articles advocate the deployment of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8338853.stm">dedicated fleets of aircraft</a> as part of a “<a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2147499">Climate Change Manhattan Project</a>” effort [Stanford Environmental Law Journal] to inject millions of tons of reflective atmospheric aerosols over cities. This would, in effect, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2012/feb/06/artificial-volcano-cool-planet-sun">create artificial volcanoes</a> to reflect sunlight back into space.</p>
<p>Other means proposed for launching millions of tons of chemicals into the stratosphere for geoengineering operations include particle-spewing smokestacks on ships at sea, tethered balloons dispensing chemical slurries pumped up from the ground, and exploding artillery shells packed with experimental chemicals. </p>
<p>Although it may be shocking to the uninitiated, field studies have already been conducted and published on the large-scale creation of man-made clouds using “controlled particle sources” dispersed from smokestacks on ships, so that the reflectivity of the atmosphere could be modified and measured. </p>
<p>For example, <a href="http://www.nae.edu/Publications/Bridge/67677/67685.aspx">here</a> is a recent technical article describing a large-scale field experiment (named E-PEACE) which <a href="http://www.nae.edu/Publications/Bridge/67677/67685.aspx">employed ships at sea involved in “engineering air pollution to brighten clouds</a>.” In this experiment “the controlled emission of smoke-generated particles” was exploited to create reflective clouds so that the effect on localized solar warming could be measured.</p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/foodcrisis.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right;float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em"><img alt="" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/--tmbBUS3P3Y/TtEcIJ043TI/AAAAAAAAM2w/LDljRbDTITE/s271/foodcrsisi160.gif"></a>And the controversial <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratospheric_Particle_Injection_for_Climate_Engineering">SPICE project</a> (Stratospheric Particle Injection for Climate Engineering), which was a UK government-funded field-test designed to “assess the feasibility of injecting particles into the stratosphere from a tethered balloon for the purposes of solar radiation management,” was only halted at the last moment due to a <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/geoengineering-experiment-cancelled-amid-patent-row-1.10645">patent dispute</a>.</p>
<p>While researchers are exploring large-scale field trials with ships and balloons for stratospheric aerosol experiments, numerous feasibility studies have been published showing that the aircraft delivery system is the most cost-effective method for “reengineering” the atmosphere on a truly global scale. </p>
<p>Along those lines, field experiments have recently been conducted in which military aircraft induced man-made cirrus clouds over England through “persistent contrails,” so that changes to the reflectivity of the atmosphere could be measured. And, as is discussed below, a custom fleet of drone aircraft has already been designed for a longer term effort aimed at dispersing one million tons of sulfuric acid per year into the stratosphere, for twenty years.</p>
<p>As a result of several years of <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/chemtrailscharlotte/the-science-behind-chemtrails">investigation</a> and <a href="http://youtu.be/sRF3ZvUhADI?t=43s">observation</a>, I believe this strategy of employing aircraft for a “stratospheric aerosol geoengineering” effort is already being quietly implemented through the US government by self-serving billionaires, like <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/chemtrailscharlotte/the-science-behind-chemtrails/billionaires-and-climate-modification">Bill Gates</a>, under the pretext of fighting global warming. </p>
<p>Consequently, I have written an extensive request for a congressional investigation into aerosol experimentation over North Carolina, which can be found here:</p>
<p><b>Request for Congressional Investigation Into Geoengineering (pdf):</b><br />
<a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/21200363/geoengineering_investigation.pdf">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/21200363/geoengineering_investigation.pdf</a></p>
<p>I have also started <a href="http://www.change.org/petitions/sen-harry-reid-stop-chemtrail-spraying-stratospheric-aerosol-geoengineering">an online petition at </a>Change.org to call attention to these chemical dispersions over my house and city.</p>
<p>Indeed, these geoengineering programs must be put under intense scrutiny.</p>
<p>Recent <a href="http://rt.com/usa/us-radioactive-louis-martino-taylor-443/">revelations of US government programs which sprayed radioactive particles over American cities</a>, not to mention <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Large_Area_Coverage">Operation Large Area Coverage</a>, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Run">Green Run Experiments</a>, or more recently the catastrophic showering of Iraqi cities with <a href="http://americamagazine.org/content/all-things/depleted-uranium-blame-iraqi-birth-defects">depleted uranium</a> and <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2005/11/17/pentagon_reverses_position_and_admits_u">white phosphorus</a>, show the dangers of blindly assuming that these current aerial spraying incidents over US cities will not contain harmful chemicals.</p>
<p>And apparently, the EPA has no interest in protecting the public from experiments that will expose them to deadly particles. In fact, the EPA is carefully conducting such experiments, all over the country. </p>
<p><a href="http://nlpc.org/stories/2012/09/25/epa-sued-over-heinous-experiments-humans">Recent exposés</a> concerning <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/larrybell/2012/11/13/epa-charged-with-lethal-experiments-on-hundreds-of-unsuspecting-subjects/">lethal EPA “gas-chamber”/particulate-exposure experiments</a> being <a href="http://www.jpands.org/vol17no4/dunn.pdf">conducted at universities around the country</a> (including North Carolina—with the blessing <a href="http://junkscience.com/2013/01/29/north-carolina-medical-board-refuses-to-discipline-epa-human-testing-docs/">of the state medical boards</a>) on the elderly and children only reinforce the need for vigilance. For example, the progress reports on one project conducted at the University of Southern California <a href="http://junksciencecom.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/diesel-exhaust-in-children-at-usc-2005-report-121412-copy.pdf">openly state they are trying to induce repeatable genetic changes in children through exposure to calibrated pollutant mixtures</a> (in order to validate their asthma causation models). </p>
<p>I can’t help wonder if the EPA is trying to determine the likely health impact of these stratospheric particle injection experiments, much like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_radiation_experiments">Atomic Energy Commission injected plutonium and other radioactive substances into pregnant women</a>, as the atom bombs were being developed.</p>

<p><b>A Closer Look: The Pretext For Large-Scale Exposure To Particulates</b></p>
<p>I propose that what I am documenting in the alarming time-lapse videos taken over my house are field trial experiments in which the spatial coverage of jet contrails is “artificially amplified” so that their reflectivity and therefore their resultant impact on global warming can be more accurately measured and differentiated from natural cirrus clouds.</p>
<p>This type of amplified contrail experimentation to create man-made cirrus clouds in order to increase “radiative perturbations” for modeling accuracy (increasing the signal-to-noise ratio) was called for in a publication by a British defense agency (DERA—Defense Evaluation and Research Agency):</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>The global temperature response to such a small radiative perturbation from contrails is unlikely to be detectable in most climate models unless the signal is artificially amplified… A better calculation of radiative forcing from contrails is feasible using an artificially amplified forcing. This would help understand the climate response … particularly as there is evidence that the climate may be more sensitive to inhomogeneous forcings (e.g. from aircraft) than forcings from other well-mixed gases. This could be done in parallel with refining contrail coverage input data. </p>

<p><b>Is the heavy spraying by aircraft that I have been documenting over Charlotte, NC a component of this large-scale experimentation?</b></p>

<p>It seems likely that the jet-induced haze I have been observing and recording is part of a global geoengineering agenda. </p>
<p>An expansion of this type of aerosol spraying program to the international realm was recently given tacit approval (under the guise of regulating <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_engineering">climate engineering</a> or “geoengineering”) by both the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-111hhrg53007/html/CHRG-111hhrg53007.htm">US Congress</a> and <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmselect/cmsctech/221/221.pdf">the British House of Commons</a>. </p>

(Gates has investments in “stress-tolerant” seed companies that could gain in value due to the controlled introduction of these climate and soil/precipitation stressors. Conveniently, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation also helps manage and operate the “Svalbard Global Seed Vault” in Norway (colloquially referred to as the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/europe/02/26/norway.seeds/index.html">Doomsday Seed Vault</a>). The “seed vault is an attempt to insure against the loss of seeds in other genebanks in case of large-scale regional or global crises.” Will a Bill Gates managed enterprise control what remains of the world’s non-patented seeds, as his sulfuric acid drones circle the earth destroying native agriculture in favor of stress-tolerant plants?) </p>
<p>I believe my observations are capturing part of this global effort to put reflective particles into the atmosphere, as <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5yWUvzi6iM">summarized by John Holdren</a> (President Obama’s top science adviser), so that the potential for increasing the earth’s reflection coefficient (also known as its albedo) to fight global warming can be evaluated: </p>

</blockquote>
<p>This high-level support for the geoengineering of our atmosphere has resulted in it being <a href="http://www.science.gov/topicpages/s/substituting+aerosol+geoengineering.html">intensely studied</a> by scientists around the world, although the general public remains largely unaware of this development. </p>
<p>Harvard Professor and Bill Gates’ climate modification consultant David Keith has made numerous statements at geoengineering conferences and other venues suggesting that mass-spraying of both <a href="http://youtu.be/j0fBcH0iuX0?t=3m6s">aluminum</a> and <a href="http://youtu.be/XkEys3PeseA?t=3m47s">sulfuric acid</a> from aircraft could be used to reduce global warming. Keith has even boasted that <a href="http://youtu.be/XkEys3PeseA?t=11m44s">he could create a global ice age</a> with this technology.</p>
<p>And as the <i>New York Times</i> prints editorials by Keith, under cartoonish titles such as “<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/20/opinion/20homerdixon.html?_r=0">Blocking The Sky To Save The Earth</a>,” NASA is conducting closed-door sessions on methods “to blot out the sun”:</p>

<p><b>Are such experiments to blot out the sun being conducted over Charlotte? If so, what chemicals are being used to make the skies white and who approved this?</b></p>
<p>Professor David Keith of Harvard has written numerous articles and studies proposing the mass-dispersion of “condensable vapor from aircraft” as a geoengineering tool. The chemical he seems to favor dispensing by the mega-ton is sulfuric acid (H2SO4):</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">

<p>Keith also oversaw the Bill Gates-funded effort to design a drone aircraft to spray the stratosphere with 20 million tons of sulfuric acid. As The Economist summarized:</p>

<p><b>The plans for the implementation of such a weather modification/geoengineering strategy go back decades.</b></p>
<p>In the late 1960s, <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/145203592/Recommended-National-Program-Weather-Modification">A Recommended National Program In Weather Modification</a> by NASA foresaw a long-term, Federal cloud-seeding operation that would explore national weather modification with “cloud condensation nuclei” using various “seeding agents,” dispersal methods and “diversified types of aircraft.” They recommended that </p>

<p>…a program of carefully planned precipitation-oriented field experiments should be carried out under complete control of the scientists, embodying the required technical knowledge, possessing continuity over a period needed for conclusiveness, and on sufficient scale to permit geographic conclusions, as well as statistical stratification according to the type of seeding agent, mode of injection, cloud type, etc… </p>

<p>And<i> <a href="http://www.bu.edu/today/2012/reengineering-the-atmosphere/">Boston University Today</a></i> magazine projected a scenario in which this fleet of aircraft might be sent on a mission to “reengineer the atmosphere” by dispersing “sufficient sulfuric acid on a global scale to cool the planet efficiently and affordably”:</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>Such a mission would, however, be one of last resort.

<p><b>Is this the method that is being implemented now? And are they using chemicals other than sulfates?</b></p>
<p>Geoengineering proponents have advocated for and patented the use of various metals, salts and polymers for dispersal in the atmosphere to modify its reflectivity. (For example, <a href="http://www.google.com/patents/US5003186?hl=en&amp;dq=welsbach+seeding">aluminum</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/patents/US3899144">titanium &amp; silica gels</a>, <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21729014.800-get-cirrus-in-the-fight-against-climate-change.html">bismuth triiodide</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/patents/WO2011073650A1?dq=Atmospheric+delivery+system&amp;ei=ojVpUrL6MdGzkAf6xoFI&amp;cl=en">Anatase crystal</a>.) We need to know how far these plans have gotten.</p>

This is based on my photographic observations and time-lapse videography over Harrisburg and Charlotte, NC, in combination with a detailed survey of the patent literature, technical articles, popular press summary articles, legislative investigations, video documentaries and observational reports. </p>
<p>This request can be found here:</p>

<a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/21200363/geoengineering_investigation.pdf">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/21200363/geoengineering_investigation.pdf</a></p>
<p>I have also started <a href="http://www.change.org/petitions/sen-harry-reid-stop-chemtrail-spraying-stratospheric-aerosol-geoengineering">an online petition on change.org calling for a congressional investigation</a> into these geoengineering operations.</p>
<p>Such an investigation is all the more urgent, as my research shows that these large-scale geoengineering spraying programs have been </p>
<ul>
<li>deemed feasible by the National Academy of Sciences and numerous recent technical studies, </li>
<li>recommended by agencies of the Federal Government (and billionaires like Bill Gates through his personal climate modification consultants),</li>
<li>the object of imminent government-industry managed field-trials (e.g. the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratospheric_Particle_Injection_for_Climate_Engineering">SPICE project</a>)</li>
<li>the subject of numerous patents, and hardware design studies</li>
<li>the subject of detailed technical papers touting the necessity of their implementation</li>
<li>increasingly propagandized for in the popular press</li>
</ul>
<p>I believe it is this agenda which is being witnessed and documented by the public throughout the world as they photograph and video-tape the creation of massive amounts of “chemtrails” over their houses and cities.</p>
<p>While the dangerous plans to dump millions of tons of toxic chemicals into the atmosphere to fight the effects of pollution may seem to be beyond the realm of possibility, history reveals numerous precedents for large-scale, long-term spraying operations that have been conducted across the globe without the consent of the public. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>the aerial defoliation and aerial weather warfare used against Vietnam in</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>o        “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Ranch_Hand">Operation Ranch Hand</a>” (“<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbicidal_warfare">herbicidal warfare</a>” with millions of tons of chemicals targeting crops for maximum strategic and psychological effect), and </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>o        “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Popeye">Operation Popeye</a>” (weaponized cloud-seeding operations that altered rainfall patterns and created monsoons); </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>the secret, seven year cloud-seeding experiments conducted over the US that were used to develop these weather modification weapons used against Vietnam (as <a href="http://www.virtual.vietnam.ttu.edu/cgi-bin/starfetch.exe?iTab.G2Nnz3xxcRpRRyykAkQg1PHexh1J1xvgt0cuQ75jeg0md3wlXixFHJwWpKfUE3ZXuzVFsJOO3VIK9S.2UA7kRgsUYwySV3yjtRxUMv1hNooIofkgA/2390601002A.pdf">declassified, top-secret congressional records</a> now show);</li>
<li>the “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_LAC">Operation Large Area Coverage</a>,” and <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2210415/Revealed-Army-scientists-secretly-sprayed-St-Louis-radioactive-particles-YEARS-test-chemical-warfare-technology.html">radioactive particle spraying over cities in the US</a> </li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/stepoutsidethebox.html" rel="nofollow" style="float: right;margin-left: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-kADbI3spO2M/TwILKt_It9I/AAAAAAAANvU/F0N-dw_gGR4/s261/cancer.png" alt=""></a>In these operations, populations were sprayed with dangerous chemicals on a massive scale without their consent. Likewise, we have not been asked if we want this dangerous “geoengineering” experimentation with various “cloud condensation nuclei” being conducted on our behalf in the name of fighting global warming. Nor have we been informed about the chemical nature of the experimental agents now being dispersed into the air that we breathe (or how these chemical agents may be serving multiple purposes). </p>
<p>I believe the public has the right to know what is being sprayed into the atmosphere, especially when the spraying of millions of tons of sulfuric acid and aluminum with dedicated fleets of aircraft have been proposed as cost-effective options. </p>
<p>I am also calling for the media to demand a congressional investigation into these geoengineering operations. As summarized on Wikipedia, it was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Popeye#Public_revelation">public exposure of the “environmental warfare” against Vietnam through Operation Popeye</a> by columnist Jack Anderson that ultimately resulted in its cessation:</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>Reporter Jack Anderson published a story in March 1971 concerning Operation Popeye. The name Operation Popeye (Pop Eye) entered the public space through a brief mention in the Pentagon Papers and a July 3, 1972, article in the <i>New York Times</i>. Operations in Laos ceased two days after the publication of the Times article.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And Congressional demands for information soon followed:</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>The press stories led to demands from members of the U.S. Congress, led by Senator Claiborne Pell, for more information. U.S. House and Senate resolutions in favor of banning environmental warfare were passed … </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am calling for similar actions today. In spite of continuous government denials that such a geoengineering program exists, we have this Vietnam-era weather modification program as a precedent showing that a high-level, large-scale, illegal and dangerous weather modification project can be developed, tested and implemented in complete secrecy, while top government officials lie about the program’s very existence (in Congressional testimony, no less), even as it is being exposed in the media. </p>
<p>As Ryan Dube <a href="http://www.topsecretwriters.com/2012/04/project-popeye-weather-modification-and-creating-rain-in-vietnam/">summarized</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>While the Air Force leadership in charge of operations in Vietnam considered weather modification to be just one more important tool in the entire arsenal at the military’s disposal, the moment Jack Anderson released details about the operation in the Washington Post on March 18, 1971, things took a turn for the worst. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>The first reaction to the release of the secret memo about Operation Popeye was denial. U.S. Defense Secretary Melvin Laird testified before Congress in 1972 that “Anderson’s wild tales” were completely false. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>However, in a private letter from Laird that was leaked to the press in January of 1974 regarding Operation Popeye, Laird admitted that he had lied in his 1972 testimony. The Defense Secretary was forced to attend a top secret Senate hearing where he and other military leaders were finally forced to admit that Anderson’s “wild” conspiracy theory was absolutely true – that the military had been seeding clouds over Cambodia, Laos, as well as North and South Vietnam from 1966 through 1972. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>The last tally once the operation ceased in 1972 included 2,600 flights, releasing over 47,000 units of material (mostly silver iodide or lead iodide) into the clouds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A study for the Air Force, entitled <i>Owning the Weather in 2025</i>, has led me to believe that these spraying experiments for military purposes have not stopped. The 2025 White Paper discusses the use of jets spraying carbon dust for both precipitation enhancement and suppression:</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>If precipitation enhancement techniques are successfully developed and the right natural conditions also exist, we must also be able to disperse carbon dust into the desired location. Transporting it in a completely controlled, safe, cost-effective, and reliable manner requires innovation. Numerous dispersal techniques have already been studied, but the most convenient, safe, and cost-effective method discussed is the use of afterburner-type jet engines to generate carbon particles while flying through the targeted air. This method is based on injection of liquid hydrocarbon fuel into the afterburner’s combustion gases. This direct generation method was found to be more desirable than another plausible method (i.e., the transport of large quantities of previously produced and properly sized carbon dust to the desired altitude). </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>The carbon dust study demonstrated that small-scale precipitation enhancement is possible and has been successfully verified under certain atmospheric conditions. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>…In addition to using … carbon dust absorption technology for precipitation enhancement, this delivery method could also be used for precipitation suppression. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p><i><a href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/ciencia/secret_projects2/project335.htm">Weather as a Force Multiplier, Owning the Weather in 2025</a> </i></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p><i>A Research Paper Presented To Air Force 2025 (1996)</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This research paper also discusses the chilling scenario in which drone aircraft (uninhabited aerospace vehicles or UAVs) use stealth technology to disperse carbon “or other effective modification agents” at any desired place as a “weather force support element (WFSE), which is a part of the commander in chief’s (CINC) air operations center (AOC)”: </p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>If this UAV technology were combined with stealth and carbon dust technologies, the result could be a UAV aircraft invisible to radar while en route to the targeted area, which could spontaneously create carbon dust in any location.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus the development of this aerosol weather modification technology might allow military control of weather on a large scale without detection. Perhaps that has been the goal of civilian research all along. As far back as 1965 “John von Neuman, one of the most influential American science advisors to the Dept. of Defense, stated”: </p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>After global climate control becomes possible, perhaps all our present involvements will seem simple. We should not deceive ourselves: once such possibilities become actual, they will be exploited </p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>I believe that public exposure of this modern-day weather modification program is the only tool we have to force the perpetrators to admit its existence and halt it. Hopefully the information and links I have provided will be helpful in this regard.</b></p>

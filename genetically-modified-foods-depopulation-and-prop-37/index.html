<p>Paul Adams, J.D.<br />
<a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2012/10/genetically-modified-foods-depopulation.html"><b>Activist Post</b></a></p>
<p>Research and studies demonstrate that Genetically Modified (GM) foods potentially serve two purposes, neither of which is to feed the starving masses or <a href="http://responsibletechnology.org/docs/gm-crops-do-not-increase-yields.pdf">increase crop yield</a> on a long-term basis.  Instead, the purposes of GM foods appear to be those of a bad science-fiction nightmare: </p>
<ol>
<li>Reduce the human population by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSpkLk0vYmk">poisoning the food supply</a>, causing increases in cancer, inflammation, disease, organ failure and premature death.  At the same time, using food to covertly render the population infertile.</li>
<li>Give a handful of elites and the companies they control complete control over the world’s food supply. </li>
</ol>
<p>As <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/doomsday-seed-vault-in-the-arctic/">Henry Kissinger said</a>, “If you control the oil you control the country; if you control the food, you control the population.”  <a href="http://www.historyplace.com/worldhistory/genocide/stalin.htm">Joseph Stalin</a> agreed and is infamous for starving millions of people to death and submission. </p>
<p>With their accomplices at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0CQrL5nzwo">Food and Drug Administration (FDA)</a> and within governments, a few <a href="http://www.gmwatch.org/gm-firms/10558-the-worlds-top-ten-seed-companies-who-owns-nature">corporate giants</a> and their major investors are responsible for much of the damage, destruction, and injuries caused by GM foods. </p>
<p><a name="more"></a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsanto_Corporation">Monsanto</a> and Dow Chemical manufacture GM seeds and toxic herbicides such as <a href="http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2012/01/15/dr-don-huber-interview-part-2.aspx">Roundup (Glyphosate)</a>.  These two corporations also produced <a href="http://naturalsociety.com/outrageous-agent-orange-maker-monsanto-seeks-return-to-vietnam-for-gmo-crops/">Agent Orange</a> herbicide. Vietnam estimates 400,000 people were killed or maimed, and 500,000 children born with birth defects as a result of Agent Orange. The Red Cross of Viet Nam estimates that up to 1 million people are disabled or have health problems due to Agent Orange. </p>

Dow Chemical was also the manufacturer of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napalm#Effects_on_people">Napalm</a>, which was used to burn the skin off children like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phan_Thi_Kim_Phuc">Phan Thi Kim Phuc</a>. </p>
<p>Why are these corporate criminals being allowed to take over the world’s food supply?  Money and corruption would be the obvious answers, but after reviewing the evidence objectively and without cognitive dissonance, depopulation and control over the world’s food supply prove more likely. </p>
<p><b>Studies Prove GM Foods and Roundup Lethal</b></p>
<p>The recent and <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2012/09/gmo-global-alert-truth-has-been-revealed.html">long-term French study</a> from the University of Caen found that eating genetically modified corn and consuming trace levels of Monsanto’s Roundup chemical fertilizer caused rats to develop horrifying tumors, widespread organ damage, and premature death. This study has been deemed “the most thorough research ever published into the health effects of GM food crops and the herbicide Roundup on rats.” </p>
<p><a href="http://www.biolsci.org/v05p0706.htm">The study found</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Up to 50% of males and 70% of females suffered <b>premature death.</b>
</li>
<li> Rats that drank trace amounts of Roundup (at levels legally allowed in the water supply) had a <b>200% to 300% increase in large tumors.</b>
</li>
<li> Rats fed GM corn and traces of Roundup suffered <b>severe organ damage</b> including liver damage and kidney damage.</li>
<li> The study fed these rats <b>NK603</b>, the Monsanto variety of GM corn that’s grown across North America and widely fed to animals and humans. This is the same corn that’s in your <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/037315_Monsanto_GM_corn_breakfast_cereals.html">corn-based breakfast cereal</a>, corn tortillas and corn snack chips.</li>
</ul>
<p>The study caused <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2208452/Russia-suspends-import-use-American-GM-corn-study-revealed-cancer-risk.html">Russia to ban imports of U.S. GM corn</a> due to the cancer risk.  France and most of Europe have effectively banned feeding GM crops to humans and Monsanto was found <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/2012/02/13/france-pesticides-monsanto-idINDEE81C0FQ20120213">guilty of ‘chemical poisoning’</a> earlier this year. </p>

<p>Russian biologist Alexey V. Surov, and his colleagues were determined to discover if <a href="http://www.responsibletechnology.org/article-gmo-soy-linked-to-sterility">Monsanto’s genetically modified soy</a>, grown on 91% of US soybean fields, leads to problems in growth or reproduction. </p>
<p>They found that after feeding hamsters for two years over three generations, those on the GM diet, and especially the group on the maximum GM soy diet, showed devastating results. By the third generation, most GM soy-fed hamsters lost the ability to have babies. They also suffered slower growth, and a high mortality rate among the pups. </p>
<p>Scientific studies have linked Monsanto’s <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/01/12/monsantos-gmo-corn-linked_n_420365.html">GM corn to organ failure</a>.</p>
<p>Other studies have linked <a href="http://www.agoracosmopolitan.com/news/health/2011/10/23/1304.html">GM foods to cancer</a>. Monsanto’s GM-derived rBGH (which is a genetically-altered growth hormone given to dairy cows to make them more milk) was shown to increase the production of IGF-1 from 70-1000%. IGF-1 is a very powerful hormone that has been linked to a 2.5-4 times higher incidence of human colon, <a href="http://www.ethicalinvesting.com/monsanto/bgh.shtml">breast and prostate cancer</a>. </p>
<p>Even <a href="http://www.pakalertpress.com/2012/02/11/monsanto-employees-dont-even-eat-gmos/">Monsanto’s employees refuse to eat GM foods</a>. </p>
<p>As the Health Ranger opined, GM foods appear to be the <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/037178_thalidomide_apology_victims.html">new Thalidomide</a>, that morning sickness drug from the late 1950s that was quickly recalled for its deadly side effects. </p>
<p>It must also be noted that <a href="http://www.sott.net/articles/show/237064-GMO-Researchers-Attacked-Evidence-Denied-and-a-Population-at-Risk">world famous researchers</a> that expose the dangers of GM foods are routinely <a href="http://www.scientistsunderattack.com/">threatened, fired, ostracized</a> and their findings denied by <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/037440_Proposition_37_Henry_Miller_Stanford_University.html">questionable “experts” with conflicts of interest</a>.  Studies proving GM food health risks are also <a href="http://rt.com/news/corn-study-gm-french-711/">routinely rejected</a> by bought-and-paid-for government officials. </p>
<p>For many years <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5B62cbwP_E">Jeffrey Smith</a> has been exposing the dangers of GM foods combined with government corruption.  Much of his research can be viewed at the <a href="http://www.responsibletechnology.org/resources/media-kit/jeffrey-m-smith-bio">Institute for Responsible Technology</a>. </p>
<p><b>GMO Corruption and Conflicts of Interest</b></p>
<p>Why are foods that contain GM ingredients allowed to be sold in the U.S. and Canada without a warning or disclaimer?  Corruption. </p>
<p>The global elite and their political puppets tell the public that toxic GM food is safe while they themselves are <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/tom-philpott/2012/09/report-monsanto-man-mitt-romney-eats-organic">obsessed with eating only organic foods</a>.  It is well known that the Clintons, Bush family, Romney family and Obamas try to eat only organic foods.   </p>
<p>Dozens of <a href="http://www.biointegrity.org/list.html">FDA scientists warned</a> that GM crops were dangerous and different from traditional crops only to be disregarded by their superiors such as Michael Taylor at the FDA. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2012/03/monsanto-fdas-michael-taylor-to-keynote.html">Michael Taylor</a> was an attorney at King &amp; Spalding that started working for Monsanto in 1981. In 1991 he filled the newly created post of Deputy Commissioner for Policy at the FDA. During that time, he signed the Federal Register notice stating that milk from cows treated with <a href="http://www.preventcancer.com/consumers/general/milk.htm">Bovine Growth Hormone (BGH) did not have to be labeled</a> as such. Between 1996 and 2000, after briefly returning to King &amp; Spalding, he then returned to Monsanto to become Vice President for Public Policy. In June of 2000 he joined the think tank Resources for the Future in the position of Senior Fellow and Director of RFF’s Center for Risk Management, where he published two documents on U.S. aid for African agriculture, both of which were funded by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaiser_Wilhelm_Institute_of_Anthropology,_Human_Heredity,_and_Eugenics">Rockefeller Foundation</a>, known for financing Nazi eugenics.  In 2009 Taylor returned to government as Senior Advisor to the FDA Commissioner and on in 2010 was appointed to FDA Deputy Commissioner for Foods.  In other words, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jeffrey-smith/youre-appointing-who-plea_b_243810.html">the fox is guarding the chickens</a>. </p>

However, it could be argued that Barack Obama may be <a href="http://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2012/09/24/meet-monsantos-number-one-lobbyist-barack-obama/">Monsanto’s number one lobbyist</a> because he filled many key USDA and FDA posts with Monsanto minions. </p>
<p>But don’t expect the other side of the false left vs. right divide and conquer paradigm to save you; <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/election/2012/09/14/850321/romney-monsanto/?mobile=nc">Mitt Romney is also a Monsanto stooge</a>: </p>

The Nation’s <a href="http://www.thenation.com/article/169885/mitt-romney-monsanto-man">investigative report</a> has uncovered how Mitt Romney personally helped Monsanto shed its string of toxic chemical-related scandals and reinvent itself to dominate American agriculture. Monsanto, an early Bain &amp; Company client, was so impressed with Romney that they started bypassing his superiors to deal with him directly. Romney’s close relationship with then CEO John Hanley prompted his boss to create Bain Capital to keep Romney from leaving and taking their largest consulting client with him. </p>

<p>The GM food issue has once again revealed that the mainstream media is a corporate whore easily purchased by the ugliest and most degenerate Johns.  “In <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/2012/10/02/4874832/no-on-prop-37-in-case-you-missed.html">recent editorials</a>, nine more California newspapers joined the growing list of publications urging voters to oppose Proposition 37 [requiring that GM foods be labeled as such) on the November ballot.”  At least 29 mindless and corrupt newspapers endorse voting no on Proposition 37. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, Matt Drudge, the undisputed king of online news with his Drudge Report, has accepted advertising from the vote no on Proposition 37 campaign and features such ads regularly.  Therefore Drudge, just like the <a href="http://www.freepress.net/ownership/chart">corporate whore media</a> oligarchy, has revealed himself as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judas_Iscariot">modern day Judas Iscariot</a> who sold-out his family, country and humanity to a group of psychopathic eugenicists hell-bent on poisoning the food supply in their Malthusian quest to reduce the population.  </p>
<p><b>The Depopulation Agenda</b></p>
<p>It is no longer a secret that the global elites’ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-CrNlilZho">endgame</a> is to <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/from-7-billion-people-to-500-million-people-the-sick-population-control-agenda-of-the-global-elite">reduce the human population by 80-95 percent</a>.  They even build monuments like the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NA7-o1gGXI">Georgia Guidestones</a> stating such.  What better way could there be than to <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2010/07/7-secret-ways-we-are-being-poisoned.html">poison the food supply</a> without people knowing it?  Profit and depopulation. </p>
<p>Prominent university Professors such as <a href="http://www.prisonplanet.com/articles/april2006/030406massculling.htm">Eric Pianka</a> and <a href="http://www.infowars.com/uc-professor-eyes-permanent-sterilant-to-cull-us-population/">Richard Cardullo</a> openly crave depopulation. </p>
<p><a href="http://activistpost.net/ultimatesurvivalplan.html" style="float: right;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-CTsdDqKcvhI/T7GjToaksaI/AAAAAAAAO2s/8vEb9HmqOhk/s316/160x316.gif"></a>Obama’s top science and technology advisor <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2012/04/haters-of-humanity-church-of-malthus.html">John P. Holdren</a>, advocated the formation of a “planetary regime” that would use a “global police force” to <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2012/03/un-policy-paper-outlines-7-building.html">enforce totalitarian measures</a> of population control, including forced abortions, mass sterilization programs conducted via the food and water supply, as well as mandatory bodily implants that would prevent couples from having children. </p>
<p>So-called think tanks such as <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2011/04/masters-of-world-meet-to-play-god-with.html">The Royal Society</a> and <a href="http://rense.com/general95/first.htm">Club of Rome</a> call for depopulation and/or tyrannical government to restrict human activity, for the earth of course. </p>
<p>World Bank guidelines dictate that in order to qualify for World Bank lending, sovereign nations must implement population reduction objectives as outlined by the World Bank and UN Population Fund. If they refuse, lending will be withdrawn. </p>
<p>Even mainstream publications such as <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/036100_death_panels_elderly_TIME_Magazine.html">TIME magazine</a> and the <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2012/08/new-medical-ethics-designer-genes-for.html">Journal of Medical Ethics</a> are conditioning the public to accept mass death. </p>
<p>Unfortunately there is no shortage of the elitists and their organizations <a href="http://www.electsake.com/pascoreport.htm">calling for humans to be forcibly or covertly culled</a>.  They want <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2012/02/democide-mass-murder-and-new-world.html">democide</a> yet refuse to lead by example by starting with themselves.  </p>
<p>Despite their own large families, billionaires such as <a href="http://www.prisonplanet.com/the-population-reduction-agenda-for-dummies.html">David Rockefeller, Ted Turner, and Bill Gates</a> openly discuss the need to reduce the population and fund programs to do just that.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/035105_Bill_Gates_Monsanto_eugenics.html">Eugenicist Bill Gates, purchased 500,000 shares in Monsanto</a> in 2010 valued at more than $23 million. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation also supports Planned Parenthood, best known for millions of abortions.  Bill Gates’ father even served on the board of Planned Parenthood.  In 2000, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation provided the International Planned Parenthood Federation $8.8 million.  </p>
<p>Planned Parenthood also receives financial support from the federal government, many millionaires, corporations and foundations, including the Rockefeller, Ford and Carnegie foundations and billionaire investor Warren Buffet’ s foundation. Planned Parenthood performed 332,278 abortions in the United States in 2009. That is about as many as the 333,012 people who lived in the city of Cincinnati, Ohio, in 2009, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.  </p>
<p>Bill Gates and the Rockefeller foundation also invest heavily in vaccine research for the purposes of sterilizing populations.  Gates openly promotes <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2012/09/is-cdcs-mandated-vaccine-schedule_29.html">using vaccines to lower the population</a>. While investing with the hope that most of humanity will eat toxic GM foods, Bill Gates decided to also invest some $30 million in a <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/doomsday-seed-vault-in-the-arctic/">doomsday seed vault</a> on the Barents Sea near the Arctic Ocean. His investment partners include the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClqUcScwnn8">Rockefeller Foundation</a>, Monsanto, Syngenta Foundation (Swiss-based major GMO seed and agrichemicals company), DuPont/Pioneer Hi-Bred (one of the world’s largest owners of patented genetically-modified plant seeds and related agrichemicals).</p>
<p>The vault has <a href="http://www.regjeringen.no/en/dep/lmd/campain/svalbard-global-seed-vault/news/arctic-seed-vault-opens-doors-for-100-mi.html?id=501721">dual blast-proof doors</a> with motion sensors, two airlocks, and walls of steel-reinforced concrete one meter thick. It will contain up to three million different varieties of seeds from the entire world, ‘so that crop diversity can be conserved for the future.’ Seeds will be specially wrapped to exclude moisture. </p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>Why do these eugenicists and corporations need a seed vault if GM foods and seeds are safe?</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/doomsday-seed-vault-in-the-arctic/">Rockefeller Foundation</a> has been investing in biotechnology for decades in hopes of conquering the world food supply in a similar fashion as they did to <a href="http://www.sntp.net/fda/piper_griffin.htm">medicine</a>, <a href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/sociopol_rockefeller03.htm">oil</a>, <a href="http://educate-yourself.org/ga/RF3chap1976.shtml">banking</a> and <a href="http://www.johntaylorgatto.com/chapters/12o.htm">education</a>. </p>
<p>Based on their history and current ambitions of depopulation, do you want the Gates and Rockefeller foundations determining what foods your family should eat? </p>
<p>As the Health Ranger says, <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/037290_Zyklon_B_GMO_food_weapons.html">GM food may be the new and improved Zyklon B 2.0.</a> Rather than rounding up billions of people and forcing them into chambers (“showers”) before gassing them to death as the Nazis did, GM food victims will pay to purchase their poison and never know why they have cancer and are sterile. After all, the USDA and FDA say GMOs are safe, so it must be true!  If Hitler had GMO technology, he would have fed GM corn to the Jews and not even bothered with the trouble of constructing gas chambers. </p>
<p>GM food is like a bait trap for ants or cockroaches. The ant or roach enters the trap, takes the food, and brings it back to the colony which then dies.  Toxic GM food works in a similar fashion – mom buys unlabeled GM food at the grocery store, brings it home, and the family eats it.  Cancer, infertility and premature death could become abundant based on independent studies. </p>

Roundup is sprayed on GM crops and has been linked to <a href="http://naturalsociety.com/monsantos-roundup-cause-birth-defects/">birth defects in unborn children</a>. Roundup is also linked to “<a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/Organic-Gardening/2005-10-01/Hazards-of-the-Worlds-Most-Common-Herbicide.aspx">reproduction problems</a>” and one study found “the herbicide caused an 86-percent decline in the total population of tadpoles.” </p>
<p><b>California Proposition 37 – Require GM Food Labeling </b></p>
<p>California Proposition 37 is the wooden stake that California voters can drive through the GM food industry’s criminal corporate hearts on November 6th.  If passed, it will require that products containing GM foods be labeled, which is akin to placing a skull and cross bones on the product. Because very few people are willing to knowingly eat GM foods, products containing them will likely be forced by consumer demand to replace GM ingredients to healthier and natural alternatives. </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-1" style="margin: 0px">

</div>
<p>Proposition 37 is a ballot initiative, meaning that over 1,000,0000 people signed a petition to have labeling GM foods placed on the election ballot. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.mercola.com/">Dr. Mercola</a>, <a href="http://us.naturespath.com/">Nature’s Path</a> and other great supporters of humanity support <a href="http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2012/09/13/california-gmo-labeling.aspx">California Proposition 37</a> financially.  They believe that GM foods should be labeled as they are in most of Europe, Russia, China, Japan, Australia, Brazil, India and many other countries. </p>
<p>There are <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/037247_Proposition_37_California_label_GMOs.html">dozens of reasons to support Proposition 37</a> and Californians can get more information at <a href="http://www.carighttoknow.org/">http://www.carighttoknow.org/</a>.  If approved by voters, the labeling initiative would make California the first state in the nation to require labels on genetically engineered crops or processed foods, such as corn, soybeans, sugar beets and Hawaiian papayas. Other states would likely follow. </p>
<p>Proposition 37 opponents have raised more than $32.5 million while Yes on 37 campaign had raised $3.5 million. Despite the financial disparity, <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-prop37-times-poll-20120927,0,5015236.story">Proposition 37 is expected to pass by more than a 2-to-1 margin</a>. </p>
<p>Who would oppose informing consumers that their food has been genetically modified?  Below is a list of the top ten contributors to the No on 37 campaign, which is <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/037273_Proposition_37_Monsanto_corporations.html">trying to stop GMO labeling in California</a>:</p>
<p>1) <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/Monsanto.html">Monsanto</a> Company, St. Louis, MO, $7,100,500<br />
2) E.I. DuPont De Nemours &amp; Co., Washington, DC, $4,900,000<br />
3) BASF Plant Science, Research Triangle Park, NC, $2,000,000<br />
4) Bayer CropScience, Research Triangle Park, NC, $2,000,000<br />
5) Dow Agrosciences LLC, Indianapolis, IN, $2,000,000<br />
6) PepsiCo, Inc., Purchase, NY, $1,716,300<br />
7) Nestle USA, Inc., Glendale, CA, $1,169,400<br />
8) Coca-Cola North America, Atlanta, GA, $1,164,400<br />
9) ConAgra Foods, Omaha, NE, $1,076,700<br />
10) Syngenta Corporation, Washington, DC, $1,000,000</p>
<p>Every one of these companies has a critical stake in making sure that you do not know what is in the food you eat because they either produces GMOs or uses GMOs in their product formulations.</p>
<p>Additionally, the companies behind some of the biggest organic brands in the country — <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/14/business/california-referendum-pits-organic-brands-against-corporate-parents.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_moc.semityn.www&amp;_r=1&amp;">Kashi, Cascadian Farm, Horizon Organic</a> oppose GM labeling and Proposition 37. </p>
<p><b>Conclusion </b></p>
<p>Independent studies reveal that GM crops are capable of reducing the population by causing increased rates of cancer, organ failure, disease and sterility.  GM crops are supported by a small group of billionaires who desire a monopoly of control over the world’s food supply and population.  The elite themselves are obsessed with eating organic foods. </p>
<p>As Mike Adams says, the GMO debate is over. There is no longer any legitimate, scientific defense of growing GM crops for human consumption.  <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/037262_GMO_Monsanto_debate.html">Anyone eating GMO is slowly committing suicide</a>. </p>
<p>GM foods must be abolished and the first step is ensuring that California Proposition 37 passes.  This will also send a message to Bill Gates, the Rockefellers, and the global elite’s corporate crime syndicate that their war on humanity is far from over and that they are simply flawed men, who despite their financial wealth gained through usury and fraud, will never accomplish their “great work” of complete world control. </p>
<p>One man, <a href="http://www.sott.net/article/223183-People-Power-Percy-Schmeiser-v-s-Monsanto">Percy Schmeiser</a>, defeated Monsanto and saved his farm.  Surely 40 million Californians can defeat Monsanto and the other GM food makers this November by passing Proposition 37.</p>
